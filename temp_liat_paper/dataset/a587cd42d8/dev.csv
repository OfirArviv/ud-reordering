text: If I’ve no WhatsApp account am I still a node on their social graph? And if so can I request to be deleted?. I have never used WhatsApp so I have never shared my phone’s contacts with them or consented to their terms. Many of my friends and family do use WhatsApp and they will all have me in thier contacts under the same name and phone number. Therefore I must have node WhatsApp’s social graph? It might be only my name and number that they have, but It’s certainly enough for them to tie it to my Facebook account and to infer a profile of me by analysing the activity of the social graph around me. If this is the case do I have any right to ask WhatsApp to delete my node as I’ve never consented to be included? (I live in the UK).

text: Canceling an ""email"" contract. I live in the UK. A few months ago, I registered at a gym. The employee there told me that I could cancel the subscription at any time. I didn't sign any contract, just gave my information. Fast forward last month, I asked to cancel my subscription. They responded that ""a welcome email was sent to me after my registration containing the terms and conditions of the gym and a 12-month obligation"". Since I did not contest that email, I am bound by a contract. I never received this email and I cannot find such an email anywhere (might had gone in the spam and then deleted, I'll never know). I asked them in writing (registered letter) to provide me of a proof that they sent the email to my account (including the email headers) or any other proof that I entered into a contract with them, but they haven't responded in 2 weeks. **Is what they did legal?** For instance, if I send to someone an email saying ""you will pay me £x per month for 12 months for this service and this is a binding contract unless you reply to me in 14 days rejecting"", is it legally binding? **Can I cancel the payments unilaterally?** They don't have any signed or verbal contract. Who has the burden of proving if I received the email or not? This is not about the money. I am just upset by their business model. The employee clearly told me I would be able to cancel with 1 month notice which he now refuses to have said. Sending at email as a binding contract without verification of receipt is sneaky at the best.

Each round is displayed for about 5 minutes on TV screens around the room, answers are handed in and graded, the correct answers are read out loud and then the next round appears. The QM claims that the questions are copyrighted. Doesn't want people taking pictures of the questions. The QM also claims that taking pictures of the Final Results Spreadsheet (Team A in 1st place with xx points. Team B in 2nd place with yy points. etc.) is plagiarism. I think the QM is spouting nonsense. ""I don't think that word means what you think it means."" I'd like to rebuke these claims, but can't find anything that references quizzes. Help?

text: Voluntary redundancy. When you are offered voluntary redundancy, do they have to tell you who else have been made offers to as well? Or can they do it on targeted basis? Does this depend on the number of affected personnel, similar to forced redundancy? In this case there *should* at least be 20+ staff affected. ie, our business unit MIGHT get restructured in a couple of of months, hence being made the offer. However, I have asked if anyone else have been made offers, not even names, just in general, but they would not answer that, other than quoting the restructuring line. I know of one other person who probably got an offer. They quoted some law (s111a of employments act 1996) which effectively prohibits me from discussing this with colleagues, or using anything said in that meeting against the company at a later stage, and have 1 week to make up my mind. When I left the managers office, he suggested that I hid the letter with the offer as to not give anyone else the wrong idea. Surely if everyone else in the same business unit had been made an offer, they would know what the envelope was? I'm just getting the feeling that they are starting a'selective culling'. Don't get me wrong, the offer they made seems reasonable and might be a good opportunity to move on. They also cover solicitor fees, so do not want to rock the boat and have them withdraw the offer, but I would appreciate honesty on their side. So, does any of this sound fishy at all?

text: Difference between ""1099-MISC worker"" and ""independent contractor"". I live in Massachusetts which recently passed a very complicated law for Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML). I'm trying to understand my obligations under this law as described on this [mass.gov page](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/whos-a-covered-individual-under-the-pfml-law#counting-ma-1099-misc-contractors-as-covered-individuals-). This page states a 1099-MISC worker is covered by the law unless the person is an independent contractor as defined in the usual way (see [here](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/independent-contractors)). So this PFML law seems to be stating that: * you can be an 1099-MISC worker, but * not be an independent contractor. I was under the impression that a 1099-MISC worker was the same thing as an independent contractor. A Google search seems to confirm this. Can anyone explain what is going on here?

text: How to approach a potential HOA dispute over a water leak. I noticed some water damage under the bathroom sink a few weeks ago. The plumber said that it's not the faucet, but something above the sink. Being that we live on the top floor it could be a roof leak or damage to the pipe above the sink. There is no way to say for sure unless more drywall is removed. According to the HOA the pipes are my responsiblity, while the roof is HOA/property management. If the leak was caused by something HOA could be responsible for, 1) As I take the steps to repair the leak, what can I do to have a better case in a situation where the HOA can be held responsible for the repair? 2) Should I notify the HOA before opening up the wall? 3) Would I be able to request/collect reimbursement for what I spent on the repairs caused by the damage they are responsible to fix? 4) If the pipe was damaged by recent roof repairs, would the HOA still be liable? I don't have much experience in legal matters and appreciate any help Thank you

text: How much of a work needs to be used for it to be derivative?. Consider for example the starship enterprise (registry NCC1701) from the star trek tv series. If someone takes a picture of the ship from the tv show and sticks it on a poster, it is clearly a derivative work. But what if they only show part of the ship? What if they only show a small enough part that it is not recognizably from the enterprise? Or what if they just produce a gray (the starship enterprise is gray) image, with ""NCC1701"" written on it? Is that a derivative work? Would it matter if it used a different font, or a different color background? Would it make a difference if it was less iconic, e.g. a reproduction of a different ship that only appeared in one episode? My question is not specific to start trek, but regarding any works which have distinctive subcomponents (e.g. the monolith from 2001, the rebel alliance symbol of from star wars, the one ring from the lord of the rings etc.) - how much of an original work needs to be reproduced for it to infringe the original copyright?

text: Is it legal to give away the Blu-Ray, DVD, or Digital Copy of a purchased combo pack?. If you purchase a movie bundle including multiple formats, is it legal to distribute one or more of those formats—at no cost—to varying family members and/or friends? When I say ""distribute"" I mean to give away the original without making copies. The verbiage from one Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital HD combo reads ""Unless expressly authorized in writing by the copyright owner, any copying, exhibition, export, *distribution* or other use of this product or any part of it is strictly prohibited."" I realize the above's intent is to prevent piracy and resale, but the way it's worded suggests that it's even illegal to give away the entire set, perhaps as a gift. That seems ridiculous and raises more questions than it addresses. Spirit of the law aside, I'm trying to understand my rights with each original copy found in a bundle.

text: Review of contract with startup. I'm considering a contract with a very small startup (in the US). The compensation is largely equity-based, as opposed to salary. I understand the offer and have strong trust in the other owners (I've worked with them previously). I don't, however, have a huge amount of trust that the small lawyer hired by the company did a great job with the contract. The primary risk I'm concerned about it that an acquiring company might take advantage of a poorly written contract to not pay me. What services are available to an individual to have this contract reviewed and ensure it protects my interests? How important is it to get the contract reviewed at this point? Is there any recourse in a future dispute for the legalese not matching the lay-person's understanding of the contract?

text: Licensing header for protecting the idea. A student asked me which license suited best for her project, but I couldn't reply.

But when the project was finished, her professor told the students their had to sign a document he forgot to give. This document stated the ""[student] yields graciously to [the brand] every work..."". She didn't sign it as is, but added that she wanted the following point; * All she wants is if [the brand] uses the whole project or part of it, internally or publically, they mention her name noticeably everywhere her work can be visible. Is there a license or something she can write on a LICENSE file, or at the top of the header of the files?

text: To what extent does copyright cover the questions in a quiz game?. I am currently working on a trivia game. I have written more than 2000 questions thanks to Wikipedia. Because there are a lot of general questions, I am worried that another board game, a video game or a TV show in the world has registered an identical question. If in my game I have a question such as ""what is the difference between perfume and cologne?"", maybe someone has registered the same question in a game. This could happen by chance and because Wikipedia is a very good website to read and create questions, and everyone can access it. Although the questions were obviously be written differently, perhaps someone wrote ""What is the characteristic that distinguishes the perfume of the cologne?"", if the context is similar, is this reportable?

The matter was settled - by a different attorney - years ago. I was reminded of it when going through some old records and am asking about it now so I can properly calibrate my gauge of appropriate behavior in the future.)

text: Can carelessness and lack of consistency in the hiring process be considered a form of discrimination?. I applied for a position as an independent contractor with a well-known tutoring company. Using their platform would have been an excellent opportunity for me. Unfortunately, my application was denied without any reasonable explanation or additional details on their part. I'm a highly qualified ACT tutor who scored in the 99th percentile in every subject area on the exam. I have experience with another nationally recognized tutoring company and received excellent reviews on their platform. I submitted a thorough and engaging profile and know I could have helped dozens of students succeed on this life-changing test. However, I can provide countless examples of approved pages on their site with typos, blatant grammatical errors, and lack of detail. The grammatical errors are particularly disturbing considering these tutors are supposed to be experts in the conventions of standard English. I can find no reasonable explanation as to why my profile was denied and these were approved other than negligence on the part of their content review team. I believe I'm being discriminated against and arbitrarily being denied an opportunity to make a living.

text: Is it illegal to create a scenario in which someone could inflict violence on another person, if said person had volunteered as part of the scenario?. So, to cut a long story short. There's an employee I work with that has stolen money and property multiple times, and that has created a hostile environment for the rest of us via the use of intimidation and threats of violence. However, our HR have their hands tied regarding any form of further discipline due to our country's laws, and his threat of a lawsuit if he is ever fired. Some employees have decided to see if they can not provoke, more trick, him into losing his cool (he has a history of a foul temperament) and attack a colleague physically, ergo providing HR a credible excuse to finally fire him, and protect themselves at the same time. The main part of the plan is not to involve the cops, as we have no intention of causing unnecessary hassle, we just want rid of him. Would such an action be illegal under law?

text: Is it legal to include verbatim exercises from a book in videos/on a blog?. I live in Florida, U.S. I recently purchased a math book that I really like, and I am thinking about making a video series or a blog where I would succcessively resolve the exercises from the book. Of course, to do so, I would have to reproduce the problem statements in their entirety. Is this a problem? I am aware of another question on this site which asks the same thing, except it is about translations of Greek manuscripts. However, I think my case is a little differet, for at least one reason: I am not sure how many of the problems are really the author's original work; in math, there are some very ""classic"" problems that are given by many authors; also, some problems are very fundamental to the theory, and were surely considered by people who first came up with the theory. Additionally, math books are notorious for not citing where they got their problems from, so again one really cannot be sure which, if any, are the author's truly original work.

text: Is it GDPR-compliant to require *public* publishing of personal info as condition for access to a service?. Background: For roughly 2 decades I've run my own private email infrastructure for myself, open source projects, and a few other individuals over business internet service intended for such usage. I've recently run into a major German ISP blocking my site (this is a new thing; I used to send to their customers with no problem) and interrupting communication with one of their customers I need to correspond with. After a few weeks of back-and-forth with their email engineering contact giving me moving-goalposts/bait-and-switch about what they want me to do to get unblocked from their system, they are now insisting that I publish legal name and physical street address for the responsible party (that would be me personally) on the web as a condition to access their service. Is this sort of requirement legal under the GDPR? I could understand (while strongly objecting to, but that's not part of the legal question here) ""sorry, we won't open our service to you"", but making an offer to provide access but making it conditional on what amounts to doxing oneself seems like it should not be legal. Is this (demanding I publish it publicly rather than give them the same information privately) some loophole for skirting around the GDPR? Is there anything else legally sketchy about the demand? I am not in Germany; the other party involved is. More details copied from clarifying comments I posted on an answer (sorry, some of this is technical and may not be useful to non-IT folks): > > The data was requested after a long series of individual email exchanges with their email engineering department (which has its own separate mail system that's not blocking my site).

text: Can one use a contract to enforce a bluff?. Amy has been working for Bill for 15 years. Despite the fact that Bill runs a very profitable company, and that Amy is a very productive employee, Bill has not given Amy a raise in 15 years. Bill has long promised he will give Amy a raise sometime in the future, but never does. Amy has threatened to quit, but Bill ignores this because he knows quitting and finding a new job will pose significant inconvenience to Amy. So Amy goes to a third party, a signs a contract with the third party. The contract states that unless Amy has received a raise of $2.00/hr by January 1, the third party is entitled to all subsequent wages she earns from Bill. The third party then gives the contract to Bill. Bill sees that if this contract is enforceable, then Amy must be very serious. Bill is a rational businessman, and calculates that the cost of giving Amy her well-deserved raise is much less than bringing on a new, untrained employee. The only question is: Is this enforceable? EDIT: Amy pays the third party a small fee. The third party is a business that specializes in these types of contracts. (Amy and Bill are not real people, so they are having trouble contacting an attorney in their jurisdiction.)

But Party2 can't enforce the contract against Party1 because he hasn't met condition precedent B. Is this, in fact, the case?

text: Is it legal to create an app, that ""streams"" a specific game from a website?. It's hard to tell what I mean in just one sentence. For example: If I would create a mobile JnR-App, with Super Mario Textures, Nintendo can sue me. But now, for another example let's take ""Gravity Guy"" by Miniclip. There is no mobile app for the current operating systems, last time it has been updated 6 years ago and now you can't play it on newer phones. But you still can play the game at their Website for free. Now what if I create an Application, that uses a web-browser engine to ""stream"" the game, so you can play it. The website gets cut off, only the game is visible. Could Miniclip sue me for that? I don't talk about other things like a name for the app. If I would call it ""Gravity Guy"", they can sue me, I mean the specific scenario ""The app connects to Miniclip and opens the game in fullscreen, so I can play it"". While connecting and opening, the user only sees a Loading-screen EDIT: With streaming, I just mean that a javascript game you normally have in your browser gets displayed in fullscreen on your phone. The game is not by me, but as the app is just a browser for it, it shouldn't be illegal I think

text: Reproducing game art in various forms for personal use and/or selling to friends. In various nerdy gaming communities, it's common for folks to produce higher quality tokens, play mats, and such containing artwork from the games. And some people will sell some of their works to basically pay for their hobby. Question 1: If someone digitally copies an image and prints it on a play mat without permission that's obviously not legal for them to sell, but is it legal for personal use under Fair Use? Question 2: Would it be illegal to use symbols from the game on tokens you create and sell? See links for an example of what I mean. The first link is actual card board images from the game. The second is the higher quality tokens someone produced. The reproduced drawings are ever so slightly different. What if they were identical? Does that matter? Or how different would they need to be? https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/7a/47/7a474142-dd1a-4eb1-8c42-1f8e1e18efe1/l5c01_rings.png> http://www.brokenegggames.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/960x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/2/0/20170825_115514.jpg>

text: Is it possible to learn who has a copyright? (USA). To briefly summarize the situation, a video game was made fifteen years ago. Two development companies and one publisher were involved. All three companies have now been sold to other companies, some of them several times, and some copyrights they held were sold independently of the companies themselves. There doesn't seem to be a record of this particular game's copyright in any of these deals (the game did not sell particularly well). Speaking with members of the original development team, it is believed the publisher had the original copyrights, but none of them are sure. The copyright does not appear on http://cocatalog.loc.gov/> using any conceivable search. The company most likely to have picked up copyrights from the original publisher is not responding to communication attempts. **In the US, is it possible to find out who owns a copyright? If so, how is this done?** **UPDATE** The game was first published in Europe, then the [PAL region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region), finally being published in the US. I'm only concerned with the US copyright, but it appears the dates and locations of original release may be important to consider. At least some development occurred in England.

I understand if they don't follow the advice I'm not liable, but if they willingly follow my advice themselves and if my advice was slightly incorrect, causing more damage, could they attempt to sue me for the damage it causes?

text: alternatives to other party signing a contract. What can bind a party to a contract other than executing it by signing it by hand or electronically and delivering it? My question is only about this element in making a contract, not consideration or other elements. The other topic cited mentions that signing per se is not required, but something is, and therein is my question. I'm thinking of a situation in which person A imposes a burden on person B and person B wants to be paid for fulfilling that burden, but person A would decline to sign a contract, claims the burden is mandatory when it's not, and might worsen the burden if asked, so isn't asked to. Example: If someone visits a doctor for an office consultation, gets the consultation, and leaves and then the doctor sends a bill to the visitor, the fact that neither one ever discussed a contract or a price and that the office had no price posted would be irrelevant and a court would rule that the visitor owed. Maybe that's the case only for medicine and some other professions and not for, say, home party hosts, although I think that could be answered by establishing, somehow, that the service provider's service is commercially valuable and deserving of compensation even if the provider is not classified as a professional. In one case, a jury was persuaded by a photo of a handshake. The parties were major companies, one well known and the other able to build or buy a factory for a big contract. I've also run into people who try not to sign anything due to a religious reason (I think), but they doubtless enter into contracts and execute them somehow, but I don't know how. Hypothetical case: In the U.S., a person writes a letter to a carpenter known to make a living as a carpenter. (Any occupation will do for this purpose, especially one for which compensation is not always expected, such as house-cleaning.) Both are adult individuals. In the letter,

text: Is Google's privacy policy compliant with GDPR for the data processing agreement between a controller and a processor?. If for your job you use any Google services, chances are you are sending them a lot of personal data of your clients in emails, documents, etc. So technically you are the controller, and Google becomes one of your processors. Is Google's current privacy policy compliant with GDPR and also valid as the data processing agreement (DPA) between a controller (you) and a processor (them)? If not, then I guess it's illegal to use Google's services for professional purposes. If it is compliant, then I'd like to know what parts of their policy actually make it a valid DPA. Edit: I just noticed that GDPR and DPAs are mentioned in the privacy policies of *some* of their products, like G-Suite and Google Cloud Platform, but I don't think this is valid in general for the privacy policy of all of their services, especially their free services. I'm sure there are millions of people who use at least one of Google's free services as part of their jobs, by the way.

The exact wordings is not available to me - however I remember vaguely that it dealt with all inventions by employees being company's property. My question is if I invent a system or develop a product in my spare time (outside office hours) and using my own personal resources (laptop, devices, personal time and effort etc...) will that still be in danger of being attacked by assignment of inventions? Can I safely assume that such property will fully be mine? (I am asking because I remember reading in a reputed book - Business Law for Entrepreneurs) that any invention/developed product can be claimed by employer even if it is produced outside normal hours of employment with personal resources - Since it is done during the term period of employment. I would love see someone shed light on this aspect since the above sounds too draconian.

text: How does equal pay for substantially similar work (as per the California Equal Pay Act) apply to commissions?. I'm curious about the following scenario. If a business hires people and pays them a commission, is the employer obligated to be neutral in how it directs sales to each employee, in cases where the employees have substantially similar skill, experience, and quality of work, or is equal commission rates enough? For instance, if two car salespeople were paid the same amount per sale, but the dealership sent the majority of the potential customers to one of the two, even though they had substantially similar skill, experience, and quality of work, would that alone violate the [California Equal Pay Act](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california_equal_pay_act.htm)? To create a scenario, consider a garden center that pays a small wage, but for the most part, employees get their revenue from commissions. The owner hires on their daughter, and even though other employees do a lot of work in handling customers and making sure the shop runs smoothly, the owner directs customers to her daughter for the final sale, making it difficult for anyone to get commission. Technically the wage is the same, and the commission rate is the same. But the owner is ensuring a disproportionate opportunity to obtain revenue, for substantially similar work.

text: How far does the derivative work copyright go for 3D printed objects?. Though similar questions have been asked before, I could not find one that answers this exact premise. Say, there is a 3D printable file distributed under e.g. the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. This license has a non-commercial clause. Another question ([Does a 3D print of a CAD file constitute a derivative work?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7336/does-a-3d-print-of-a-cad-file-constitute-a-derivative-work)) already confirms that prints of 3D models are a derivative work of the file and thus still fall under the original license. This would mean, one could not sell a print of a thus protected file. But how does that relate to the First Sale Doctrine? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine>) The First Sale Doctrine says, that the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute a particular copy ends once they make it's first sale. So e.g. a copyright owner cannot stop a buyer of a book of theirs from reselling this particular copy of the book, while still retaining the right to stop the buyer from copying the book. Now, one could argue that distributing the file and allowing others to make physical copies from that file would be similar to a first sale and thus allow the owner of the physical copy of the object to resell it. If that's not the case, what else can the copyright owner restrict the license taker restrict from doing? Would it be possible to restrict the license taker to only print the file e.g. using a specific brand of filament? Can the copyright owner dictate terms of use for 3D printed objects derived from their file?

I am creating a tool for players and DMs of D&D. The reason i've been trying to understand the copyright law in regards to this issue is that upon using any information from the books created by WotC you'd violate their copyright. Luckily, WotC has a ""Open Gaming License"" that you can use, to have much of the rules, items and monsters in your book, program, etc. for free (Link to the link of the SRD-OGL: http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd>) My issue is that WotC has intentionally left out some of the unique monsters that they themselves has created over the years. Which in itself is fine, but i have no idea if i would violate their copyright for these unique monsters if i were to create a module in my program where the enduser would be able to build a custom monster from a blank template (name: input here, armor class: input here etc. - you can look at an example on, say, page 279 with the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here name would be Tyrannosaurus Rex and Armor class would be 13 (natural armor)) If the enduser were to create a totally custom, madeup creature i'd imagine that tool would be fine, but i can also see the scenario where a enduser could copy letter for letter the information of a copyrighted monster into my custom monster template and essentially adding a copyright-violating item into the program. So. I guess in essence what i am asking is: By making a tool in my program that can enable the user to create their own monsters, will i then be in trouble because i've

text: Legality of ""Version x or later"" licenses. A standard way to license something under the GPL, is to grant a license to the ""GPL version 3 or later"", meaning that the recipient receives a license under the license terms of the GPLv3, or at their choice any later version of the GPL. I have been told that in the EU, or at least Germany this is impossible because the license constitutes a contract, and it's not lawful to enter into a contract that has terms that are unknown to you at the time of entering it. Is this correct?

text: What if the President defies Congress and the courts?. So it is now a matter of public record that [the President plans to defy all House subpoenas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/donald-trump-subpoenas.html?module=inline). 1. Do I correctly understand that Federal employees, notably including the Armed Forces, pledge their duty first to the Constitution of the United States and only secondarily to carry out legal orders? And that they have no legal obligation to execute an illegal order? What process allows a subordinate to defy an illegal order if a superior gives the order? What legal protection does the subordinate have? 2. Suppose the Congress holds someone in contempt. The Congress, as I understand it, goes to a court to enforce the contempt charge. The court turns to Federal law enforcement to bring action. What if the President directs Federal law enforcement to ignore the court order? What if law enforcement complies with the President? 3. Suppose Congress orders fines. What is to be done if no one will enforce the fines? 4. Same scenario as 1 but this time it’s impeachment and conviction: the President defies any action to remove him. 5. What if the President simply barricades himself in the White House and orders security and military personnel to protect him? Is there a protocol in the U.S. military hierarchy to deal with this scenario? 6. What should common citizens do if any of these scenarios play out?

text: Does not following a religion ""to the letter"" disqualify you from protection of religious freedom?. I could probably come up with a logical argument as to why individual religious beliefs and patterns of behavior should be protected in the same way as those which belong to a ""recognized"" religion, but I'm wondering what kind of case law exists on the issue. I'll separate this into two questions. 1. There are many cases where an individual practices a form of Christianity which is different from a generally agreed upon profile of the religion. For instance, essentially no Christian follows the idea that women are not allowed to speak in Church. It seems common for the layperson to argue that such ""hypocrisy"" precludes a person from being protected by the first amendment. What does the case law say on this? 2. Related to this, if a person happens to have an individual religious belief which again differs from the general profile of what is considered to be Christianity, is that belief still protected? It would seem that protection of religion would be on an individual basis. In other words, so long as a person holds a specific religious belief or follows a specific religious pattern of behavior, then regardless of what religion with which the person identifies, the person would be protected in the exact same way as if the person somehow managed to ""perfectly"" match an expected profile of a given religion.

text: What crime did Walter White commit against Jane in Breaking Bad?. In an episode of the famous series Breaking Bad, the main character, Walter White, is responsible for the death of Jane, the girlfriend of Jesse. The main question is, from a legal point of view, how much is he responsible for this? Is this a homicide? What kind? Here's a summary of what happened; you can find a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGEmFpitjYw). Walter and Jesse are partners and they make drugs. Jane is the girlfriend of Jesse and Walter doesn't like that, since he thinks she could be an obstacle to their business. Both Jane and Jesse have problems with drugs. One day Walter enters Jesse's house, where Jesse and Jane are in the bed together, on their sides, completely stoned, unable to wake up, and apparently sleeping. Walter tries to wake up Jesse shaking him strongly without success. Doing that he modified slightly the position of Jessie and a conseguence (since she was in a sort of hug with him) Jane. In particular now she is on her back. It is not clear if she had a pillow on her back to avoid this position. Some time before, Jesse had explained to Walter that in this situation the pillow is important, since it keeps you on your side and not in your back, so if you vomit you avoid choking to death. And this is exactly what happens. In the new sleeping position, Jane starts to vomit and cough, while still sleeping. At first Walter tries to react, running to the other side of the bed to help her, but then he stops and decides to do nothing as she dies. What is this? Homicide? Voluntary? Or just failure to assist a person in danger? Are there extenuating circumstances due to the fact that the actual cause of death is the drug? Take into account that Walter could have easily saved her with no risk.

Some relevant information: * The bot will be running remotely on a rented server in US jurisdiction. * No web resources, legal or otherwise, will be saved to persistent storage. * I will not be viewing any material the bot accesses. I will only view its analysis. * I cannot keep a site blacklist. The bot will crawl as far as it can. * The crawling activity will not interfere with the functionality of the website. * Only public resources that can be accessed by anyone will be crawled. * The bot may attempt to sign itself up to websites if registration is necessary. I believe that it is likely, if not certain, that the bot will end up accessing illegal material at least once. When it does so, it will fetch the webpage into memory and analyze it. This analysis will be saved to disk. The analysis will contain information regarding anomalies in image file formats, obfuscated JavaScript, non-standard use of CSS, rare HTML tags and uses, etc. It will also save the URL. After analyzing the page, it will continue crawling as a typical web spider, following links. Am I responsible for any laws broken by the bot, given that I am not intending for it to access illegal material but am aware that there is a distinct possibility that it will? Is there anything I should be aware of to reduce the risk of the bot taking an illegal action which I would be responsible for? Given that one could argue (correctly, but out of context

text: What kinds of crimes do not affect persons or property?. A crime is a public offense, so I would think that anything that constitutes a crime has some kind of influence on one or more persons or property, i.e. it changes the public universe in some negative way. According to a recent CA Criminal Justice exam of mine, ""A person may be guilty of a crime even where his or her act has no immediate effect upon the person or property of another."" ""Immediate"" is not further defined. If this is true, what are some examples?

text: Copyright and newspaper illustrations. I've recently come across a newspaper illustration from the mid-1920s which I'd like to reprint. Here in the US, the term of copyright for written material is the life of the author + 70 years. What is the law with regards to reprinting newspaper illustrations (where the rights were likely sold) and what are the laws for copyright on artwork? The work is an illustration of the London Beis Din by Bryan de Grineau (1882-1957) discussed [here](https://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2010/07/bet-din-1920s-style.html).

text: Employer forcing everyone to sign new contract which significantly affects working hours. My employer has recently undergone a number of changes internally, involving the move to different premises (with the argument about the new building being larger, however will accommodate roughly the same number of staff as the current building will occupy). As part of this, they have sent around an update to the employment contract which basically nullifies the flexible working hours which previously has been in effect. Many people I work with vary their working hours to fit in with their lives, and has been accepted - up to this point. The business operated a core working hours of 10am to 4pm, but are changing this to 9am - 5pm, with a 30 minute ""flexible start/end"" that employees can start and end their working day (e.g; 8.30am to 5pm, or 9am to 5.30pm) - effectively removing the concept of flexible working hours completely. This affects many people's lives, and some of my colleagues are petitioning to retain their flexible working hours, of which are being met with strict rules surrounding a mandatory lunch hour/half hour, no option to work less than this to make up the time (despite being willing to), and one has been forced to drop their hours to 36/week. They also put in a clause to the portion that they're wanting everyone to sign which says that everyone must specify when, between the hours to 12pm to 2pm, they will take their lunch, and must be rigid over this (unless a meeting is occurring, in which case that overrides your lunch hour and you must take it later). This was also met with protest, and they eventually caved and relaxed this rigidity slightly, then sent across some minutes from that meeting ratifying this. They will not, however, update the contract to reflect this as they've said that the meeting minutes ratifies it. However, we don't believe this would ever stand up in court if a dispute ever arose. Is this true? The final part of this demands flexibility from the employee for the business's requirements (e.g;

text: Can company hide an identity of creator for personal safety reasons?. Imagine that somebody plans to create a work of an art (say, a comic or computer game), that depicts various religious forces from an attitude that can be perceived as extremely critical by their representatives. While it's generally safe to assume that followers of most major religions (say, Christians, Buddhists, Hinduists and so on) can take criticism without violence, potential author might be worried about reaction from radical Muslim community. Given somewhat recent example of Charlie Hebdo slaughter, it's not uncommon for this community to react inadequately to even mild criticism. While choosing **not** to create such a work might sound like a solution, essentially it's just indirectly accepting the fear of death threats, ""thinking of consequences"" and so on — the ill constructs this work of art is meant to fight with. So, the question is — is there any legal way (so, no fake IDs) to ensure personal safety of such an author, if author wants to create this product, and sell it via online distribution platforms? Would it possible to create a company that does not disclose the identity of who had created it and owns it, to act as an alias for a person? If yes, can it be still considered safe, or names can be still obtained via requests? What kind of legal counselor should potential author contact to discuss this matter? Exact jurisdiction does not matter as long as they allow foreigners to create companies with desired properties.

text: What kinds payments/accounts are reported under the automated exchange of tax information between countries?. I'm trying to understand how the automated exchange of tax information works between countries. I'm vaguely aware of the OECD's Common Reporting Standard ""activating"" this year and introducing some additional reporting responsibilities of customer's accounts for financial institutions, but I don't understand the details or know to what extent the automated exchange has been working already and what the CRS changes in terms of that. What I'm mostly interested about is, what kinds of institutions are required to report information about their customers and to what extent? I understand that things like banks or brokerages have to share account information. But what about all the other various kinds of companies that in some way process payments/hold some funds of their customers? For example, what about ""online wallets"" like Paypal/Neteller/Skrill? Do those share their customers' account information? What about all the sports betting sites, do they have to report? How about online marketplaces, where for example people sell/buy games, virtual items and so on among each other? The list could go on, but I think you understand my point - are only the ""traditional"" forms of financial insitutions required to report all this information, or do all these businesses that in some way process payments, participate in the automatic exchange of information?

text: Can a business keep funds it has collected if it cannot complete an order agreement because the paying party proves unreachable?. In this context, I have in mind a typical business transaction, not a complex contract with explicit terms and so forth. Suppose a business receives an order from a customer, and payment for the order is received in whole or part, but the business has issues with delivering on it's end because of circumstances outside of it's control, like a bad receiving address, or a bad email (often used as the customer's gateway to access virtual products). The business surely has a duty to attempt to contact the customer to complete the order, but what if the customer proves unreachable based on the means available to the company (phone, email, mail, etc.)? In other words, you call, but they never call back, or your only contact method is email, but it bounces back. If the order was placed via a credit card, the business can easily issue a refund despite the inability to contact the customer. Even with payment by check, the business can send out a refund check to a mail address, assuming there's been no evidence of a bad receiving address. The question is, does this business have a legal duty to any such actions? I know credit card companies will typically not process refunds for transactions older than 60 days, so is there a time limitation after which the company may assume the order ""complete"" and retain the funds? I'm concerned only with US Law. Specifically, the business I have in mind is in the State of Idaho, but most customers are not Idaho residents.

text: Contract necessary for the most basic processing under GPDR?. I am very pleased to have found this resource and am hoping I can be guided to some clarity on some points regarding processing of webserver access logs. I have not yet found these addressed here or elsewhere. My partner and I host a number of websites for a range of clients. For some of those clients we consider we do not process any personal data - we set no cookies, use no analytics services, collect no data from the user via forms, and so on. We do however collect IP addresses in our webserver access logs. It is clear from all I have read (particularly re *Patrick Breyer vs Germany*) that we need to consider IP addresses as personal data, however I have read (I have sadly mislayed the source) that the CJEU considered there were legitimate cybersecurity interests for recording them (though see comment below). **My query:** Collection of IP addresses in access logs is noted as normal operations for a web host, and GDPR outlines provisions for doing so to maintain security and investigate breaches. But because IP addresses are personal data, do we now need to create a new contract to outline how we will use this data? **Additional info:** I see from this resource that Article 11 has a provision for my query: Article 11 (1) ""Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification."" http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-11-processing-which-does-not-require-identification-GDPR.htm> This though would not exempt us or the Controller from having a contract for the collection of the IP address (unusable as it is for identifying a

text: Would police in the US have any alternative for handling a confiscated computer with a hidden partition?. I've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything. Without going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it. I know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used. So say that a suspected criminal, who used

text: Could asking an author for a copy of their research article be illegal?. I've been following [an interesting Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/710834488645816321) which raised the idea that merely *asking* a researcher for a copy of a paper they've written could be against the law. From the linked tweet: > > you would be soliciting the violation of the law by requesting access to a copyrighted work > > > I guess the argument is the following: in the process of publication, authors typically transfer ownership of the copyright in their paper to the publishing journal. Sometimes the copyright transfer agreement specifies that the author retains the right to distribute copies of the paper, and sometimes it does not. If the agreement does not have this provision, it is being argued that asking the author for something they do not have the right to distribute could be contributory copyright infringement. Especially if you (the requesting third party) know - or believe - that the author doesn't have the right to redistribute the paper. It's worth noting here that most publishers put the standard copyright transfer agreement they ask authors to sign on their website, and authors are typically somewhat familiar with the standard agreements used by the journals they read and publish in. This sounds rather crazy. I find it hard to believe that a simple informal request (which the author is free to deny, of course) could be against the law. Then again, that doesn't keep it from being true. I'm sure it will take a court to definitively decide this issue, but I want to ask here, is it even *plausible* that making such a request would, in fact, be found to constitute contributory copyright infringement or some other violation of that nature? Or is there no realistic way it would happen? I'm especially interested in answers that can cite relevant references, statute or case law or whatever, that would likely influence the decision in a hypothetical case testing the issue. As far as

So as for my question - I stumbled upon this discussion on reddit and started thinking, what if country X just passed a law that grants marijuana the same legal status as for example tobacco. A code of conduct in a workplace A objects any use of marijuana and punishes their employee for a failing a single test by a small margin by relieving him from the duty. As far as I know, in the hierarchy of law, a company's code of conduct, must comply or in other words ""is under"" the actual laws of employment, etc (That is at least how it works in Latvia). So unless the employee was under such an influence that would hinder his ability to work and this has been a regular occurrence; was it a lawful sacking? This is my first question here, so I hope that this is an appropriate way of asking.

I'm curious about this UK site - [handpicked.org](https://www.handpicked.org/) - which republishes images from from social media accounts and other online sources. The pics are linked to the source, but don't carry a full attribution - just an icon and name to indicate where they came from. In some cases images are taken from other publishers like BuzzFeed. Some of the images even have copyright watermarks showing they came from a picture agency. The site isn't reproducing the pics for review, or research, but apparently for commercial purposes. The main website doesn't carry advertising, though ads are visible when you view it in the web view of the Facebook mobile app. In the back end, images are taken from the source's URL, resized and re-served from the site's own server. They seem to republish most or all of the original image. Is there any justification for this in law? As far as I know, images published on social media remain the property of the person who posted them - you can't use them without permission. The lack of attribution suggests to me they're doing it without getting consent from the source.

text: Why'representation or warranty', not'representation or condition'?. Why's ""warranty"" coupled with ""representation"", not 'condition'? Context ------- In [Canadian](https://renx.ca/representations-v-warranties-are-they-different-do-you-know-the-difference/) and [English](https://mundays.co.uk/insights/to-warrant-is-not-to-represent/) law, representations differ from warranties1. Thus they aren't doublets, as [Ashurst's](https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/quickguides-warranties-and-indemnities/) distinguishes them beneath (as do [Cripps LLP](https://www.cripps.co.uk/contractual-representations-warranties-difference-matters/), [Osborne Clarke](https://www.osborneclarke.com/insights/representations-and-warranties-in-private-ma/), [Blake Morgan](https://www.blakemorgan.co.uk/training-knowledge/features-and-articles/warranties-representations/), [Walker Morris](https://www.walkermorris.co.uk/publications/disputes-matter-autumnwinter-2016/warranties-andor-representations-matters/)). > > A warranty is a term of the contract, a breach of which gives the innocent party the right to claim damages but not to treat the contract as repudiated.

While poorly worded, another [question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17218/linux-questions-when-moderator-do-not-care-about-keeping-the-laws-of-a-forum), which is currently on hold, brings up a good point: does a company have a contractual obligation to uphold its TOS, or can its moderators arbitrarily enforce its internal rules. As an example, can Facebook choose whether or not to enforce its TOS for some posts, and yet ignore their standards for others? It seems like the TOS is a contract, and it would specifically need to say in the contract that enforcement is at the company's discretion. Does Facebook have such a clause?

text: Can I use a trademarked name as part of mobile app title?. I have created an app which is basicly a tool for some other trademarked product. Because I want users looking for an app like this to know what is it for, I would like to use the trademarked name of the product as part of the app title, for example: ""Product name tool"". Also I would like to use the trademarked name in the description of the app a few times (Keyword search optimization) but I would put something like ""App is not affiliated with Product name"" in short description and in both top and bottom of long description. Could this cause a trademark infringement or some other problems?

text: Company knowingly debit fees it is not due from bank account and does not return it: is this fraud or theft?. This morning, I was reading [this article](https://consumerist.com/2016/06/22/comcast-admits-it-incorrectly-debited-1775-from-account-tells-me-to-sort-it-out-with-bank/) on the Consumerist about a man who cancelled his business service with Comcast. In summary, he had an early termination fee of $1,775 debited from his bank account, which shouldn't have happened because it was past the term of his two-year contract. Comcast do not dispute those facts, and have repeatedly told him that a check was on its way but, two years later, the man has still not been unable to get a refund. At one point, he was told by a company representative that refunds are not issued in these circumstances, and that he should instead dispute the charge with his bank. I am interested in the potential criminal liability in a situation like this (not necessarily this one) where a company knowingly takes money it is not due from someone's bank account and clearly has no intention of returning it. Specifically: 1. Could the victim report this as fraud, theft or some other related crime? 2. Would the answer to the previous question differ based on whether the victim was eventually able to recover the money through litigation or by disputing the charge with their bank? 3. Would the company itself or the specific employees involved be liable? 4. Would a binding arbitration clause in the contract have any effect on criminal liability (I believe not)? I would be especially (but not exclusively) interested in answers covering either the United States or Canada (especially Québec).

text: Are contracts seen as ""future"" agreements as well?. Scenario... * A is hired by B to perform a task - Project X. They agree and sign contract which details payment terms, ownership, project scope, dispute resolution, etc. All goes well. Project is completed and payment made. * Three months later B returns and asks A for a separate project - Project Y. Both agree on pricing via email but no contract is signed. Project is completed, payment is made. * Six months later B returns to A for yet a different project - Project Z. Both agree on pricing via email but no contract is actually signed. A dispute arises over ownership of Project Z. Are the (more general) terms on the original contract still assumed to be accurate for this third project? In other words, are there cases where a previously singed contract would be seen as an agreement for future collaborations? I understand (perhaps incorrectly) that by default, leases tend to have the terms seen as extended if no new lease is signed but occupancy continues, but does this apply to other contracts?

text: Who would be legally responsible for the application of mainstream wrong psychological/psychiatrist therapies?. Several times has happened that the definition of mental disorders/ psychological-psychiatrist therapies/theories have been proven wrong. Yet they have been applied over people causing them problems and harm in their lives. Usually graduated psychologists/ psychiatrists are ignorant which is the supposed proof of these theories. They've been told they have been proven sometimes, sometimes they've been given some details, and they don't know they don't have a real basis behind them until it's massively accepted they are wrong. Personally, I see little to no responsibilities in them. In the other hand, governments and states promote these theories in secondary schools, they teach them and form professionals in national universities, and they hold the power to treat people in trials and to internate someone for being ill under these theories. Some other organizations, which I'm not very aware who they are, but I assume they might be colleges or agrupations of psychiatrists/psychologists regulate their professional's activities, and I assume they might be the ones giving the content to national universities for the formation of professionals under these theories. When one of these theories/therapies are proven wrong and have caused harm over people, who is the legal responsibility? I assume there aren't many cases like this, but I make the parallelism with biological sciences. If an association or group produces a medicament which is proven harmful for people later, and that association teaches doctors to give this medicament to people, with the approval and fundings/places of national government created universities, it would be pretty much the same. Then, in the case stated in the topic question, who would be legally responsible for the application of these mainstream wrong psychological/psychiatrist therapies?

text: What recourse do I have when someone has bought an old domain of mine, and mirrored my content (badly)?. I am based in the UK and I have run the [opendomesday.org](https://opendomesday.org) website as a free, non-profit history site for many years. When I originally built the site, about 8 years ago, I registered it at [domesdaymap.co.uk](http://domesdaymap.co.uk). After a couple of years, I decided a.org domain was more appropriate for the project since it is non-profit. For several years I paid for the.co.uk address and redirected it to the.org address. In about 2016 I decided I didn't want to pay for the.co.uk address any more, since all it was doing was redirecting, so let it lapse. Now I find that someone has re-registered the http://domesdaymap.co.uk> address. This is not in itself a problem, but the problem is that they have set up a mirror of all my content there. What can I do about this? The copied content has my name on, and people are contacting me to tell me that the content is broken (which it is). I don't mind someone else owning that domain, but I do mind my content being on it and being broken. I have tried contacting the registered owner of the.co.uk domain without success. What can I do?

text: Can a company use another brand's name when describing their product?. I'm working on a project and the best way I've found to sum it up, essentially my elevator pitch, is by saying: > > It's like X for Y. > > > Can I use the brand in this context as the tag line for my project? To use a specific example, could the (now defunct) app [Texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_(app)), which allowed users to access hundreds of magazines, have advertised itself with the tagline: > > Like Netflix for magazines. > > > From [reading on the topic](https://www.gfrlaw.com/what-we-do/insights/beyond-brand-x-using-another%E2%80%99s-trademark-your-own-advertising), it seems like there are four categories for using another brand in an ad: * Comparative * Tarnishment * Parody * Fair Use **Tarnishment & Parody**: I think it's safe to say the example above is not tarnishment or parody. **Comparative**: Comparative seems to center around doing some sort of actual comparison with a competitor, like comparing Coke to Pepsi. **Fair Use**: It seems like the statement above would fall under fair use, but I'm unclear if it's acceptable fair use. I don't think anyone would mistake the statement as implying in any way that Netflix endorses Texture, but the comparison does make use of the value of the Netflix brand (namely, it being a comprehensive repository of an entertainment product).

That said, were such a situation to escalate, would the executive have actions they could take that would weaken the judiciary? Likewise, does the judiciary have any proactive defenses against such measures? My understanding is that Article III judges are fairly well protected from retaliation by their lifetime appointment. Rude remarks aside, are there actions that could, in practice, weaken their powers or imperil their jobs?

text: Disputing Tenancy Deposit Scheme Adjudication Decisions. After years of complaining about the lack of care the landlord had for the property I was renting from them I finally got served an eviction notice. I moved out, and 2 weeks later because of terms in the tenancy agreement I was still renting the property but there was a water leak from a bathroom pipe. I was issued a demand for £4,500 worth of damage to the property which would partially be covered by the deposit which i refused to pay. I went to my insurance company who told me that they would sort everything out until the landlord claimed that I had deliberately damaged the pipe in the bathroom. At this point the Insurance company offered me only advice but would not handle the case. I raised a dispute with the tenancy deposit scheme in order to recover my deposit giving lots of evidence showing that I had continuously complained about the bathroom the whole of of the time I had been living there, at one point the landlord sent their brother in law to fit a whole new bathroom (poorly I might add) and yet all of this was shot down by the adjudicator with the reason being... The landlords report states that I damaged the pipe so due to ""the balance of probabilities"" I was in breach of my tenancy agreement and my full deposit has been awarded to the landlord to cover renovation costs. I am also aware the landlord intends to sue me for the rest of the cost I refused to pay outside of the adjudication process. My understanding (which may be wrong)... In a civil case the law seems to state that if I am ""probably at fault"" (in this case, I had a set of keys which appears to be enough to implicate me) then I likely am liable. In a Criminal case it would have to be certain that I did indeed cause the damage and proof to that nature would need to be provided in order for me to be deemed liable. So, my question is... Given that the landlord claims I ""criminally damaged"" their property but never provided a single shred of evidence to back this up what can I do

I've noticed that literally all online EU shops and service providers (e.g. web hosting) add VAT to the price.

text: Cancel contract ordered from online shop via email in Germany. I live in Germany and have ordered a part for my Angel Juicer from an online shop (cca. 100 EUR). The part is not available on the online webshop directly, so I contacted the seller. The seller said that he must order it and then is able to deliver. I then confirmed my order and waited. It took longer than expected and in the meantime I got the part from elsewhere. The seller contacted me today that he is able to deliver, but I refused and tried to cancel the contract. The seller is now saying that I can not do that, because the part was ordered directly for me and there is no ""Widerrufsrecht"". It's not a personalized part. I ordered from Germany, the seller is in Austria (Wien). Can I send back the part if I receive it and cancel the contract (in written form)? I tried to cancel the contract via email.

text: My pregnant wife is experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an incompetent manager. What are her rights?. My wife has had a new boss a few months back. He does not understand the role his team plays in the organisation. He has tried to force (he uses the word encourage) my wife to take up work that is not in the purview of her role. He has tried to get her to take on work that other teams have to do (this is documented in the process), all under the name of improving working environment. He has tried to force (again encourage according to him) her to change her personal development goals in the company. My wife is 5 months into pregnancy and a few days back I had to take her to the A&E after she complained about severe abdominal pains. This followed an extremely stressful 2 hour long meeting with her boss. I have observed that she is stressed every time there is a meeting with her boss. What are her legal rights? She does not want to quit her job. She has absolutely no confidence in the HR. Can she talk to the doctor and get off for a few days without affecting her maternity leave?

Same applies to architectural drawings of mundane nature and same applies to several forms of technical drawings. These are then covered by different laws. First: Even if i do not get copyright over these entities in my locale am I entitled to copyright in those locales that allow such things?

Second: If an external entity owns the copyright of something that does not fall under copyright in my region does that mean that copyright does not apply to me?

text: Can I be sued for demanding a refund for a service that was not provided?. Over the past few months I paid for a 1 year subscription to an online tabletop roleplay gaming service. The seller had no ToS to be signed and recently after critique about the service began circulating, the seller made a ToS. The first condition was was that any complaints about the service was to be brought up only to staff(the seller) as well as making mention of punishment to violations to the terms. From what I knew of the seller with my personal interactions with him over these past few months he was basically telling me(and the other customers) to not speak poorly of his service in the public domain of his server. When confronted with this ToS, I responded with how I did not agree to such restrictions and that I would be withdrawing from his service if this was the way he intended to go. Not 7 hours later I receive an email stating that my subscription was being terminated. Before this I had intended to just walk away and leave it at that. But after seeing as how he was banning multiple people who spoke out about being dissatisfied, I decided I would be requesting a refund for the 9 months of service I will not be able to get now. I went through paypal's refund claim process and was met with the seller stating that the services I paid for had already been delivered in full(his company has not even existed for a full year yet) and with his mention of resorting to a lawyer in his response, though not directly saying he would. I recalled him once bragging about how good his lawyer friend was and can not say I'd put it past him to try to sue me if he thought he could.

text: Works published before which year are internationally in public domain?. Figuring out whether a work is in public domain can be quite complex as different countries have different rules and there are often a lot of (relatively) complex exceptions. There must however be a cut off point before which you can be sure beyond any reasonably doubt that the work is in public domain. Which year would this be? Or put differently: What is the oldest work which is not yet in the public domain? And just for the record, I am aware that this might be a bit of a complex question, but it seems to be quite a reasonable question, especially if you would wish to use the work for some product that you wish to distribute internationally (e.g. [this question made me think of it](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/105240/can-i-include-a-public-domain-book-in-my-game)). Now, I do realize that other issues can come up (trademarks, later editions and moral rights for example), but to keep the question reasonable just ignore those (though as an aside they are fine).

text: Public domain English translation of Mein Kampf. As I understand it, Hitler's book *Mein Kampf* was originally copyrighted by Hitler, but, after the war, the Allies gave the copyright to Bavaria. (Was this legal? I guess I should post that as a separate question.) I just learned that Bavaria's copyright expired in 2016. I'd like to learn if there are any English translations that are also in the public domain. In particular, I suspect an English version published by the Germans in 1940 for the planned invasion of England might be in the public domain. A copy is available online [here](https://archive.org/details/MeinKampf.StalagEditionOfficiallyAuthorizedByTheNSDAPIn1940ForTheInvasionOfBritain/page/n17). It is described as open source, contributed by the community, suggesting it's in the public domain. However, I wondered if the government of Bavaria could claim ownership of this work as a derivative of the original, German language edition. So my specific question is this: Is the English-version edition of *Mein Kampf* linked to in the paragraph above in the public domain?

text: Does an absolute discharge result in a criminal record?. In England and Wales, a court can impose an absolute discharge if it concludes that 'it is inexpedient to inflict punishment'. The power to do this is granted by [s12(1) Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/12). Section 14(1) of the Act provides that— > >... a conviction of an offence for which an order is made under section 12 above discharging the offender absolutely or conditionally **shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose** other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made... > > > However, the [Crown Prosecution Service's guide to sentencing](https://www.cps.gov.uk/victims_witnesses/going_to_court/sentencing.html) says this: > > Absolute discharge - no further action is taken, since either the offence was very minor, or the court considers that the experience has been enough of a deterrent. **The offender will receive a criminal record**. > > > (emphasis mine in both extracts) If a person receives an absolute discharge and also a criminal record, surely this is treating the discharge as a conviction, which appears to fly in the face of s14(1) above. Does an absolute discharge result in a criminal record and, if so, how is this squared with s14(1) of the 2000 Act?

text: misdemeanor complaint, state requested release conditions, discovery evidence. I was charged with a misdemeanor, but the court messed up and sent the misdemeanor complaint to a wrong address. Never receiving it, never appearing at the court, they then created a warrant for my arrest, which they sent to my correct address, and I did receive, with $1000 bail amount. I then appeared in court, showed the judge the court messed up (the court found their letters to a wrong address), and she quashed the warrant and removed any bail payment. However she gave me various release conditions, removing various rights (e.g. no firearms). I then asked the judge, if you remove these rights, can you show me the basis for the charges, the discovery evidence against me. She could not, and had no idea of how to get it, even stating this is an unusual request. Perhaps this is because of the way their address mess-up resulted in a warrant for my arrest. To me this is wrong -- my rights should not be removed in a situation like this, alleged harassment, without providing me any evidence against me. My question is, how would it have gone differently if they sent the misdemeanor complaint to my correct address, and I appeared, and the state had requested certain release conditions while filing the complaint (which they did, at time of filing the complaint). What typically happens at the first appearance of a complaint? Are they allowed to remove your rights, without providing you any discovery evidence? --- I added two comments, that ideally help advance the discussion ---

text: Who owns rights to a live streamed footage of a concert?. I work for a festival in the digital department. I received a request from a documentary filmmaker about wanting to use a portion of a live-streamed footage of our concert. The clip lives on our YouTube channel, which is where the filmmaker came across it. In the contract with the performing band, it stipulates that the festival reserves to right to live stream the performance and place on YouTube in perpetuity, and also that media outlets may use record and use 2 minutes of the performance (doesn't say of the 'livestreamed' performance). It doesn't say anything about allowing a third party to use it for another type of a production (=documentary). My question is: who owns rights to this footage? The festival, the company that did the livestreaming, the band, the band's label? Do I (as the festival) have a right to give permission to use the footage to this filmmaker? If I should refer them to someone else, who should it be? If it helps, I am in Canada, the artist from Columbia, as is the filmmaker who made the request.

text: What does USPTO status 604 ""Abandoned after inter partes decision"" mean for a trademark?. What does the United States Patent and Trademark Office status [604 Abandoned after inter partes decision](http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons181.htm) mean for the trademark? Is the trademark in the public domain or so clouded that it could be used as such? Does the original claimant involved have more rights or explicitly zero rights to the mark than a third party? The concrete reason I ask is the monthly transit pass I happened to buy today uses the old [Pennsylvania Railroad PRR trademark](https://trademarks.justia.com/860/21/prr-pennsylvania-86021658.html) as the authenticity hologram. (The transit agency, SEPTA, was a customer of the PRR and its successor, Conrail, 1962-1982, and currently leases track from another PRR successor, Amtrak, but is not itself a successor to the PRR bankruptcy) A little googling found the Justia link above, showing this status change very recently, in October 2015. I naturally wonder what this means. Is SEPTA in the clear? Given decades of operating agreements, they may have explicit unexpired contract rights to use logos in printed schedules or fare media without owning them? How about historical rail collectors who [paint](https://m.facebook.com/Juniata-Terminal-PRR-E8s-171921079527695/) the PRR livery and logo on rail equipment? If I, wholly unrelated, wanted to make PRR memorabilia (or hypothetically paint a PRR logo on a van then employ it as an Uber or similar to trade on the 150 year transportation history of the mark) does the abandoned trademark status permit this?

text: How can an agreement supersede another contemporaneous agreement?. I came across this type of clause, and found that it's quite common. I understand the part that says an agreement supersedes any previous agreements, but the clause looks something like this: > > Supersedes Previous Agreements. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, commitments, agreements and writings with respect to the subject matter hereof, all such other negotiations, commitments, agreements and writings will have no further force or effect, and the parties to any such other negotiation, commitment, agreement or writing will have no further rights or obligations thereunder. > > [Lawinsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/supersedes-previous-agreements?cursor=) > > > I understand that a new agreement can supersede an older one. All that needs to be done in that case is to establish the time that any other ones were made, and by comparison you can know that one in particular is the latest one. But I don't understand how an agreement can supersede all over contemporaneous agreements. I understand ""contemporaneous"" to mean at the same time, am I wrong about that? Is it even possible for two separate agreements to be made exactly contemporaneously? Also what happens if other agreements have this clause (that it supersedes all other agreements)? If it is possible for multiple agreements to be made exactly contemporaneously (which I take to mean exactly at the same time, which I'm not sure is possible), doesn't this result in multiple agreements superseding each other?

Clone a website inside an app, is it copyright infringement or not?

text: Do I need to ask for permission to use tokens?. I know that you need to ask the user for permission to use cookies. However I use OAuth from Google Firebase. OAuth works with tokens instead of cookie-authentication, however, for the user it makes no difference. She/he gets authenticated across pages. Since I didn't find anything regarding ""permission for tokens"", I assume that I don't need it. Is this right? Any legal proof would be awesome.

text: Why do prosecutors sometimes chase ""weak"" cases?. From what I understand, the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service is an exception to this question. Its rate of winning convictions is something like 80%, and about half the remaining cases are settled on terms favorable to the IRS. So it loses only a statistically inevitable ""handful"" of cases, where there might have been unexpected exonerating circumstances. This varies in different parts of the United States, but from what I understand, prosecutors in some parts of the country sometimes pursue weak cases, usually against poor defendants. They have to prove ""guilty"" beyond a reasonable doubt,"" but it seems to me that the level of proven ""guilt"" in many of these cases is less than in the IRS cases. And it seems that most districts' prosecutions have higher rats of acquittal and/or wrongful convictions than the IRS. What could be the reasons for this? Could it be that the IRS is a ""national"" organization while districts are ""local"" Does the IRS do a better job of picking ""guilty"" parties than district attorneys because they know that potential defendants have the money and attributes to defend themselves? (From what I understand, the IRS rejects potentially meritorious cases that come below the 80% threshold, while some district attorneys seem to prosecute based on ""probable cause,"" and get many acquittals, or wrongful convictions.)

text: If a law changes very recently, is there a grace period due to not knowing the new law change?. I was recently watching a video of a police officer who lied to a driver that ""a new law passed"" that allows police officers to stop someone from recording. The driver was an attorney and knew better. I was curious about this situation where a law changes that you may not be aware of because it only very recently passes. It seems wrong that someone who may have been not aware it was recently changed would be punished. I imagine it depends on the severity of the law, but is there some sort of grace period due to information not travelling fast enough? While I think the above scenario is a little extreme, any advice is appreciated.

text: Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. ""The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"" Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament. Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October. Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea. Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final port at the start of a voyage. Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. ""Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told. ""Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law. ""No one has said the boycott will

text: The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate

text: Rockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results, despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments, President Donald Beall told. Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. ""It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share,"" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. ""I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts,"" Beall said, adding, ""long-term, we have a very serious problem."" In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

text: The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).

On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87.

text: The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,"" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

text: Missouri Republican Senators John Danforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that would allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting. Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by the House tomorrow. Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable to further damage this year.

text: Diversified investment company, Ariadne Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper reported. The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week. ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised."" San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines. Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.

Claremont added that it asked Champion to put two representatives on its nine-member board of directors. Claremont previously disclosed in December that it had agreed to act in concert with Walsh, Greenwood and Co, an affiliated investment firm, to acquire Champion Products. Claremont said it made net purchases of 7,800 Champion Products shares between Jan. 28 and March 18. In a March 20 letter to Champion Chairman John Tanis, Claremont and Walsh representatives Stephen Walsh and John Cirigliano said they were pleased with the company's performance but wanted to take an active management role. ""We believe that Champion Products has just begun to evolve into the market leader it will eventually become,"" they said. ""As significant shareholders with mutual interests with the company, we would like to actively participate in this process."" Claremont's intentions and the letter were made public in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.

text: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement action against Allegheny International Inc, the Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said. Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc. ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said. ""The company is cooperating in the commission's investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said. In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked for information about company executive compensation and benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft. It also has asked for information on acquisitions and divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other internal controls,"" Allegheny said. The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said. The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions. The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements. The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors. Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price. Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges. The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buck

text: Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs. Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs.

text: Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's Stearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. It said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price. Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years, in constant dollars.

text: New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress, sources on Capitol Hill said. USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities. The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the New York Times reported yesterday. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"" Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said. Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said. Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry. A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was ""marginal."" In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees ""a tough call,"" this source said. USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month. While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said. The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill. Congressional staff

text: The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out

text: Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income. Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks. ""Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation,"" Glickman told the hearing. The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan. David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program. The current soybean program ""gave us the worst of both worlds,"" ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said. ""We need some kind of market loan,"" he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a ""dilemna"" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration. In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at

text: The Belgian National Bank cut interest rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30 pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a telex message. The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate rates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all three periods by 0.10 points. A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates. The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday. The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the three-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is no formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following the March 23 changes.

text: U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact. ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said. The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31. Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln. Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing,"" he added. The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures. Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected."" The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into

text: ""If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on."" Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years. ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up."" ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year. ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures. ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient."" An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion

text: American Motors Corp's board of directors is meeting this morning in New York to consider Chrysler Corp's C> 1.5 billion dlr takeover offer, an American Motors spokesman said. The spokesman reiterated statements made earlier in the week that the regularly scheduled meeting was being held. The spokesman would not comment on recurring speculation that the board might receive a higher offer from Chrysler. Analysts have said the fact that American Motors' stock has remained above the four dlrs a share Chrysler offer could lead the larger company to raise its bid. The American Motors spokesman said he had not seen any indication that a higher offer would be received from Chrysler, although he added, ""I don't know what the conversation is in the meeting."" He repeated statements made earlier in the week by the automaker that today's meeting will probably not result in a final decision on the Chrysler bid. ""The board first apprised the proposal on the 11th (of March). I suspect there will be several more (meetings) after this,"" the spokesman said. The meeting is expected to go through early afternoon.

text: Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, ""the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."" Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, ""there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."" He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify

text: The U.K. government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said. Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit. Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said. Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions. Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said. But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.

text: The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called ""mixed credits,"" the OECD said. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use. ""A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today,"" a senior U.S. Official here commented.

text: Cooper Industries Inc asked the Federal Trade Commission to vacate a 1979 order that requires the company to get FTC approval before making certain acquisitions, the FTC said. The order was issued as part of a settlement of FTC charges that Cooper's merger with Gardner-Denver Co would lessen competion and increase concentration in the gas compressor and industrial air tool industries, the FTC said. The order requires that, until 1989, Cooper must get FTC approval before acquiring companies in the natural gas compressor or hand-held industrial pneumatic tool businesses.

text: Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,"" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino. ""I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level."" ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were

text: Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying. The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said. Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said. Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said. Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying. Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks. The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

text: Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said. Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures. The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities. The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31. But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system. The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers. However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates. On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.

text: Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said. Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program ""dilemma"" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate. Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu. Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs. The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut. Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs. He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an ""umbrella"" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans. Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said ""the competitive problem is the most severe."" He said USDA is still studying the situation and ""no resolution"" has yet been found.

text: American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch. After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries. ""Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"" he said. ""The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,"" Bennett added. Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said. The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said. The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added. The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said. ""We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC

text: Tense trade relations with the U.S. And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow. EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations. The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners. The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax. They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs. It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States. The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway. The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom. Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected. But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was

text: Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said. However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

text: Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat. Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies. Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said a dealer at one major U.S. bank. As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to

text: Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said. The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane. Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said. The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December. He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane. But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said. ""It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls,"" he said.

text: Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a ""strategic reserve"" target of

They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33 billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing Rights, the spokesman said.

text: Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said ""significant progress"" was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging. Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons, Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries. Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, ""a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging."" In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost. ""Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades, we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising, one that is under-developed and under-employed,"" said Mulroney. ""What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity."" Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners. Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes, something that would give Canada protection from Washington's tough trade remedy laws. But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a ""fair trader"" and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market. He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides. ""We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is fair to both

text: A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada"" provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage. Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers. He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit

text: French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts. For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs. The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said. Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark. Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said. If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector. Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase. Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords

text: The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush trader said. ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days

text: A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. ""We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,"" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction

text: The Kansas City Board of Trade, KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan would put the the Kansas exchange ""at a serious competitive disadvantage."" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts. At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat speculative position limits unchanged. ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC. A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT's limits. KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators. The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat. CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until June 3.

text: USX Corp said proved reserves of oil and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985. The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan

text: Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements ""is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together."" The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC. Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31 billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985.

text: Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. ""Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market,"" Li said. ""The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings."" Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

text: Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request. ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have."" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. ""The best way to lower

text: Britain and Australia have offered a total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects, officials said. They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would be shipped next week and used for the government's ""Food for Work"" program in the villages. Under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money. The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said. Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.

text: Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said. Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986. Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and Development, told the rising reserves were ""a big headache for Taiwan."" He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S. Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S. Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S. Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang's remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. ""We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,"" he said. He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies. Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses. He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details. The Taiwan dollar has risen

text: The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow, delegates said. ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a ""pre-compromise"" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said. While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said. ""I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the session,"" a consumer delegate said. Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades, delegates said. Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin. Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said. The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.

text: The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said. The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985. Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet. The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985. Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers. Of them, some 18,000 clients cla&#127;imed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said. Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list. They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and n&#127;earby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said. To&#127;&#127;day's arre&#127;st came a&#127;&#127;fter narly two years of joint&#127; investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who &#127;had questioned about 3,000 of&#127;&#127; the firm's former employees&#127;, police

text: up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said. They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. ""the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic,"" president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told. ""we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared,"" he said. Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead. So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said. Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: ""the number of dead and injured is not known... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."" Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district.

text: With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods."" Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working. At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Jan

text: Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit. ""The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"" he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.

text: Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said. Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted. Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders. The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar.

The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport Employees union said Western's management should fulfil a promise to honour union contracts if a merger took place. The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials could not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the merger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.

text: The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business

text: Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations by Pipeline. The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders said. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as 26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4 pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as Alaska North Slope, were up one pct. In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22 cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs, a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up 22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Northern Europe was generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to 19.58 dlrs a barrel. Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to 16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. were weaker with weak gasoline prices sending the yield at cracking plants down 68 cts to 18.42 dlrs from the previous Friday, as shown below in dlrs a barrel.

text: Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to

Dravo saidperformance so far this year in its engineering and construction segment has not met earlier expectations. It said the first quarter will be impacted by writedowns resulting fromn revised estimates of costs required to complete projects and by delays in starting work on jobs originally forecasted to contribute to first quarter earnings. Dravo further said it has given the investor group buying Dravo's river transportation, stevedoring and pipe frabrication businesses additional time to structure the necessary permanenty financing, and closing is now expected in the third quarter.

text: The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8063 marks after 1.8231 on Friday, dealers said.

text: Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be

text: Healthcare Services Of America Inc said it will write off about 16 mln dlrs in non-recurring expenses in 1986. It also said it expects income from operations to be about breakeven for 1986 and the estimated loss for the year to be about the same as the writeoffs. Results will be released by March 31, 1987.

text: Chapman Energy INc said it is launching a major restructuring which, if not approved, it will have no alternative but to seek protection under Chapter 11. Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due 2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners Ltd. The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to Chapman. Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest and control of the board. In addition, Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs acquisition joint ventures, it said.

text: The European Community (EC) delivered warnings to both Japan and the United States over trade frictions which have hit relations between the Community and its main trading partners. EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets. Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves. EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns. The ministers' said they were ""very disturbed"" by the U.S. moves, adding, ""the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations."" Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."" The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand. Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It wil be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said. De Clercq told journalists, ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan."" But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a

If you want a PM to deal with Kashmir issue and Agni 3 missiles POK giving to Pakistan then it is only ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE OR A REBEL MAN LIKE BALASAHEB THAKARE can do these jobs.

text: What theories explain the origin of the Phillipines? Explain Continental Drift, Tectonic, Pacific, Asiatic, Land bridge theory. The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands in the South China Sea situated between Taiwan to the north and Borneo to the south. Just 2,000 of its islands are inhabited and only 500 are larger than a kilometre square. The nine largest islands of Luzon, Mindanao, Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Samar, Negros, Leyte and Cebu make up 90% of the nation's land area. The islands are located on the western margin of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and are undergoing mountain building through volcanic activity. The islands therefore have some very rugged terrain, and there is a very limited amount of land suitable for agriculture. The region is also noted for its great amount of earthquake activity.

text: How can Maryland Family Law allow a child to be with a parent he doesn't know? How can I go in front of 2 masters and 1 judge with proven evidence that the biological father, who hasn't been around for 7 years, only recently popped into the picture and breaks promise after promise, does not follow court orders, and has lied so many times that I was able to catch him in them - all of this written proof by me, family, and other court advocates, and yet the court is allowing this child to travel 5 states away to be with him because ""now"" he is showing an interest! Is Maryland the only messed up state that does not look at proven evidence and child's best interest? No, your not the only one that feels that way. My girlfriend is from Maryland. She has been going through custody issues with her soon to be ex, and it has been a nightmare. He wanted absolutely nothing to do with his two kids while they were living under the same roof. Then when she left, he tried to be father of the year. He injured his son recently and charges were filed against him. He is calling his son a liar and denying what happened. It isnt the fault of the court system, its the idiotic judges who make the rulings. Remember Judge Palumbo who was recently removed from the bench in Prince Georges county over the woman whose ex-husband set her on fire? He is a prime example of an idiotic, biased judge.

text: Does remaining life partners make more sense than marriage? Does remaining in a committed relationship let the couple define their relationship how they want it and realize everyday that you're there because you WANT to be there rather than because a piece of paper (a marriage license) says so.n nOr is marriage sacred and is the ultimate expression of love between two people?n nThis isn't about deep commitment phobia but people who have chosen to remain life partners rather than actually doing the aisle walk.... Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a protection. if you don't plan on staying with someone, or having children, or making property community, there is no need for it. People shouldn't enter into it lightly, and I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated. People couldn't marry for money, or insurance, etc...

If you mean why does it feel as if your heart is beating in your head or hand or foot, etc? Well sometimes when your blood pressure changes the added intensity of flow will cause your extremity to ""beat"" but it is just your blood moving through your arteries and each ""beat"" is a surge of blood. It happens when you have been exercising, get excited, have a sudden bust of adrenaline or even if your circulation was temporarily cut off and it has recently been restarted (like when you sit on your foot or cross your legs).n nnIts nothing to worry about unless it happens a lot. If it happens often you could have hypertension and should ask your doctor about it.

Even if he can score 35 points, the Detroit Pistons defense, which has been dominant for the last three seasons, will be able to keep this series a low scoring game.n nLeBron has only six NBA Playoff games experience going into this playoff series. Even if LeBron and the Cleveland Cavaliers don't win the series, LeBron will gain valuable experience.n nJust look at Michael Jordan it took him 8 NBA seasons to finally win his first NBA title. In the 1989 and 1990 seasons, he lost to the Detroit Pistons who were known as the bad boys of the NBA because their black-and-blue defense.

text: Anyone Know? Ok. I have had a cold a couple weeks ago and now a sinus infection. I know you can spread colds by coughing or kissing stuff like that. What i want to know is can you spread it to someone else if you have oral sex performed on you? Cuz with a runny nose you spread the germs through the mucous and the vagina has a mucous lining.Any Ideas? I think ordinary cold viruses grow only in your respiratory tract, and they are shed only from there. Most viruses are adapted to attack a specific tissue and don't travel far through your body (even if you had oral herpes that wouldn't mean you could spread it from your genitals). So no - if your partner gets a cold, it's not from the oral sex, it was transmitted the usual way, through microscopic flecks of your saliva or snot.

text: What is the best solution to fixing the public schools? I have been thinking about this issue and I have came to the decision that throwing more money is not the greatest idea. ""Throwing money""... what an odd choice of words. When you buy groceries, do you call that ""throwing money"" at your nutritional needs?n nFirst, the realization that we can longer get good teachers cheap. Women now have many options other than secretary, nurse, teacher, housewife. Why would ""the best and brightest"" persue a 4 year degree in a profession that pays so poorly? Teachers should make as least as much as nurses, firefighters. Further, they are professionals deserving of respect, not nannies to shoulder the blame when the children misbehave.n nSecond, free them to teach. When teachers are expected to be psychologists, nutritionists, sex educators, social workers, vocational counselors, public health workers, and substitute parents... when are they supposed to teach reading and math? How is it that school systems have been burdened with so many duties and functions which should be shouldered by parents, child welfare agencies, public health departments, law enforcement, et al.n nThird, give them the right of exclusion. It is simply WRONG to allow one or two disruptive students to prevent the other 28 from learning. Why do taxpayers allow their money to be squandered on such nonsense?n nForth, realize the education of children is a service, not a business. Get the bean counters out.

text: do sharks die if they touch the ocean floor? my son just read that in a book & wants to know if it's true. It is a myth that sharks have to constantly swim or else drown. As so often with exotic animals, apex predators in particular, we find such stories to be passed on through generations, and even tons of excellent studies on the animals cannot change commonly held opinion. What is the basis for this wrongly held believe?n nMost ""fishes"" breath by producing a conintuous water flow over their gills making use of what is called the buccal/opercular pump. You surely have observed fish in an aquarium before, and have noticed how they rhythmically open and close their mouths. What you may or may not have seen was that in the same rhythm, only slightly delayed, a bone on the side of the head opened and closed. What you saw was the buccal/opercular pump at action. The bone on the side of the head was the operculum. It covers the gill openings with the gills. When the fish opens its mouth (i.e., the buccal cavity), the operculum is closed. The fish fills its mouth with water rich in oxygen, opens the operculum and at the same time closes its mouth. As an effect, the water is being pressed out through the gill openings and over the gills. Next, the operculum is closed while at the same time the mouth opens and the cycle is repeated. By this form of active breathing the animal can indeed achieve a constant flow of water over its gills. n nSharks, like all other elasmobranchs (i.e., sharks, skates, and rays) do not have operculi. Instead, their gill slits are visible at the side of their heads. Early biologists thought that sharks therefor could not be stationary at the sea bottom, since without an operculum they could not

text: Do you think the Harry Potter movies need to follow the books more? I know the after book 2, the remaining books are long, but wouldnt it be worth it to try and encompass as much as possible from the books.

The terms and conditions in US is such that there's none. n nMaybe it's because no one cared or dared to fight for them.

text: In addition to my previous question.....? Okay, well I asked my question yesterday about Christianity and how where it is okay to be Christian, those countries are better off. I got some ridiculous excuses from those who disagreed with me. Let me ask again: Does it make sense that where it is okay to be Christian, those people are better off? You're going to argue that there are people in other countries who are well off too. But think about this, if someone asked you ""Where would you rather live: America or the middle east?"" what would your answer be? What if someone asked you ""Where you would rather live: England or Africa?"" what would your answer be? What if they said ""If you could choose any place to live, what would it be?"" then what would you answer. Your answers would probably be the place where it is okay to be a Christian. I strongly believe that God blesses places where it is okay to believe in Him. So is what you're saying that climate and population have nothing to do with those problems?n nAnd are you also saying that there are no christians in any of those countries? n nAnd are you also saying that christians are the only people who should be allowed to live comfortably?n nAnd are you also saying that none of those problems exist in the US? n nDo you know that some if not all of these conditions exist in some of the south american countries, which by the way are predominately christian and catholic?n nI think you sound a bit crazy.n nnI hate doing this but you are really making yourself sound stupid. First off- NYC has had a gay parade for years and we have not had a natural disaster up here. Second- Allah and God are the same thing, maybe you should do some research. Allah is not said to be human, where in the world did you even get that from?

He had everything to gain. He was a shunned child growing up for being an illegitimate child. This childhood abuse caused serious psychological problems. He craved attention, and when he got it, it was never enough. When the attention stopped making him feel better he began craving pain. That is why (which we've recently found out in the Judas writings) he asked his good friend Judas to turn him in. Jesus wanted to be punished on the cross. He made that crown of thorns himself to prove to himself that he can still feel.

text: ""White Buffalo Turquoise"" jewelry related....? Ok - first question - ""White Buffalo Turquoise"" is not REALLY turquoise at all, right? I can't remember if it's 'howlite' or something like that?n nSecond, does anyone know where to find this stone set in jewelry - preferably made by Native Americans in the Southwestern US? (and at a reasonable price?) n nThanks for your input... ""White Buffalo"" Turquoise nn nnWhen discovered in the Dry Creek Mine, north of Austin, Nevada, in 1993, they were not sure what it was. Because of its hardness, it was decided to send it in to be assayed and their suspicions proved correct; it was in fact White Turquoise. It was not until 1996, however, that it was finally made into jewelry. n nThe chemical name for Turquoise is Aluma Phosphate which, in its pure chemical state, is white. Turquoise takes on color via an intrusion of either copper or iron. In the case of Dry Creek ore, the slight coloration, when present, is the result of copper. The more intrusion, the darker the color.n nBlue turquoise forms where there is copper present, which is the case with most Arizona turquoises. Green turquoise forms where iron is present, the case with most Nevada turquoises. White Turquoise forms where there are no heavy metals present, which turns out to be a very rare occurrence. To date, no other vein of gem quality white turquoise has been discovered anywhere else in the world. When this current vein runs out, that will be the last of it. Because White Turquoise is as rare as a white buffalo, the Indians call it ""White Buffalo"" Turquoise. The White Turquoise is itself considered sacred and powerful. The jewelry-making is an honoring or tribute to the ""White Buffalo"" Turquoise.

text: What is the origin of the word posh? Port Out Starboard Home has not been proven. The origin of the word is obscure. The first recorded use of the word was in the British satirical magazine Punch on 25 September 1918, although an earlier possible reference uses the word push [4]. The OED records a definition of the word as a noun from 1890, meaning ""a dandy"".n nA popular but false etymology states the expression originated from the phrase ""Port Out, Starboard Home"", which, before air-conditioning, were allegedly the most desirable cabin locations on ships travelling to and from British colonies in the Far East because they were shaded from the sun in both directions. However, extensive searching of shipping company records and tickets from that period has failed to reveal any evidence for explicit ""Port Out, Starboard Home"" reservations. [1][2][4].n nThis false definition is not helped by a song in the musical version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The song P.O.S.H. including the lyrics:n n""Whenever I'm bored I travel abroad but ever so properly, n""Port out, starboard home, posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh.""

text: Are there examples of medical researchers holding personal beliefs that God created the universe and life? nan medical researchers, yes. probably quite a few. there are also quite a few evolutionary biologists, and paleontologists who hold personal beliefs that God created the universe and life.n nhowever, there are very few (if any) evolutionary biologists or paleontologists who believe that a literal version of creation as laid in out the bible took place (i.e. in six days, man created from dust, woman from man's rib etc. etc.)n nthat literal interpretation just doesn't fit with the physical evidence that has been uncovered (and is even inconsistent with itself).n nas far as medical researchers, there are probably some who do believe in a literal biblical story of creation, but their professional opinion on the matter is about as relevant as an automotive mechanics. they are certainly skilled workers in their own field, but evolution is not where their expertise lies.

text: What would it do to your if faith if it was proven that the Apostle Paul was guilty of adultery? Let's say that ancient court transcripts were uncovered in Rome that proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the eminent Apostle Paul plead guilty in civil court to the charge of adultry in 78 AD. How would that affect your reading of the nearly 2/3 of the New Testament he authored? Paul was a person too...and people are flawed. Judah was only one brother of 11 who sold his youngest brother to slave traders and Jesus came from his line. It isn't our job to judge other people or allow them to alter our faith in God. I think that if it were found that he plead guilty because he was then he was a human doing better than most humans because most wouldn't plead guilty...they would lie and try to cover up what they did. The key to this question is the idea of repentance...we should focus on his repentance and turning from sin rather than the sin. Being a man of God doesn't make him exempt from the human tendancy to sin...that's the name of the game when you have true faith...the temptation doesn't go away, it's how you deal with it.

text: How do I set up a ""home network"" for my Tivo??? nan Well first off you need Internet service. After that a 4-port router/switch and a cat5 network cable. From there it depends on how your network is setup. If your router is giving out addresses via DHCP the TiVo's network card will automatically get and address. If you're assigning IP addresses then you have to go into the messages and setup menu then to Phone and network menu and from there you can give the TiVO whatever address, subnet and gateway IP's you've choosen.nRemember you can only do this with a Series 2 TiVo. There aren't many series 1 boxes around so its a good bet that if you bought it in the last year or so its a series 2.n nI would have to say getting someone on the phone to help you out would be your best bet if you're not familiar with networking as it would be a lot easier and less frustrating to complete. I was able to do it pretty easily as my job is networking. n nTry TiVo's customer support if you run into issues. Everytime i've called them they've been pretty helpful. Link below to their support page if needed.

It sometimes is hard to tell them apart sometimes. Your best bet is that if you did not contact them, then they are more then likely trying to take advantage of you.n nMy recomendation would be to ask them for a contact phone number so that you can talk with them directly (and also be sure to ask when a conviniate time to call would be).n nAfter getting the number, first check it. My recomendations would to be use http://www.anywho.com to do a reverse directory search on the phone number to see who the number is registered to. In additon it turns out that google.com has a great phone number directory so simply search the same number on google.com also ( i learned even today, google publishes even UNPUBLISHED numbers...).n nThe reason for doing this will to be able to...nfirst, see if they are a legitamate bussiness and if they even have a phone number you can reach them at,nand secound you can track Who that phone number is registered to.n n-edit DO NOT DO BUSSINESS WITH THEM... the texacoltd.com website is not only down (and written in geocites) it obviously is not a ""real bussiness"". There is a chance (be it a slight chance) that they might have a really crappy website designer that does not know what they are doing.n nStill my recomendation would be to stay away from them.

text: Im in the 8th grade, and i need help dividing trinomials by binomials.? nan It's set up like a long division problem. Let's say you have x2 - 6x - 27 divided by x + 3. You'd set up like this:n nx + 3 ) x2 - 6x - 27 nnFor polynomial division, just focus on the variables and the exponents. To start this one, look at how many times x goes into x2: x times. So x would go on top of the dividing symbol, and then you'd multiply the value on top by the value on the outside and subtract, just like a long division problem. So you'd end up with nnx2 - 6x - 27 n-(x2 + 3x)n----------n-9x - 27 nnRemember that, just like long division, you're subtracting, so the problems becomes x2 - 6x - 27 - x2 - 3x if you wrote it out this way. The x2 terms cancel out, and you'd have to bring down the -27.n nNow repeat the process - how many times does x go into -9x? -9 times. So the -9 goes on top (making your top x - 9) and your problem look like this:n nx2 - 6x - 27 n-(x2 + 3x)n----------n-9x - 27 n-(-9x - 27)n----------n0 nnSince you have no remainder, your answer is x - 9. And if you're ever unsure, you can always use FOIL to see if you get your original trinomial:n n(x +

I own both of these rackets. oh how cool is that.....anyway the babolat feels slightly heavier but it gave me more power....nIt also kind of depends on how hard you hit....caz I'm a girl so I need a racket with more power which was the babolat.......I love my pure drive because it is comfortable for me. I kinda liked the Head Flexpoint because it wasn't as heavy as the babolat. But if you take tennis seriously and you play matches I say go for the Babolat :)

text: Is it much cheaper getting cosmetic surgery in mexico?Say like,getting breast implants? nan Sure it is, but of course you get what you pay for and it depends on how much you value your own life. In Mexico there is no such thing as malpractice if things go wrong. Most importantly, if there IS a complication, the nearest hospital's equipment is usually behind the United States by about 30 years. Anything you do that medically causes you to become unconscious should be handled by a doctor with a noted excellent reputation. Make sure your doctor is board certified by the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Cosmetic Surgeons. You can also call your state board or look at their website to check if a doctor was disciplined or censured. You can't do these things to protect your self in Mexico, however, since there is no board that is governed to protect the patient. I can think of no logical reason to hop across the boarder when we have the best medical care and some of the best doctor's in the world here in our own back yard.

text: My husband is set on me being bi and doing threesomes? He is insisting i become bi and give him threesomes or our 17 year marriage is over. He is always on computer looking at porn. I'm not bi nor do i want to be I love him but he is tearing me apart inside. What to do? It sounds to me like a little boy asking for mommy's permission to be bad... that way he has all the pleasure of playing with matches, but evades the responsibility.n nGuy's have this way of being real cowards about ending a relationship. Instead they push their wife... and push and push and push until she is backed into a corner with no option BUT to say ""I've had it -- no more!"" and then... they go around saying ""Well, SHE wanted a divorce."" Once again, a little boy evading responsiblity.n nIf you want to keep this marriage, get some counselling. He needs to hear an outsider tell him he's being a jerk and not just you. If you'd just as soon be free to find a man who will honor and cherish you, then call his bluff. Tell him no way is a third person joining you in your marriage bed and when is initiating that divorce and moving out?

text: HELP! I have LOST my password for my 2Wire wirless router!!? Is there any way that I can recover it? I can't add my new computer onto it, without the password. And about a year ago when I first set up the system, I didn't provide a password hint to help me remember it. n nHas anybody came across this problem, & how did you solve it. n nIt would be much help to me, considering I can't get my new computer online.n nThanks. There should be a tiny reset button somewhere on the router. You will prolly have to use a pen tip or something to press it in. You ussually have to hold it for 2-3 seconds for it to work. It will re3set everything to ""factory"", meaning it wil be like you just bought the router. Most likely the default password is ""password"", or there is none until you set it. If you have problems after the reset, goto manufacturer website, and you should be able to enter you model number and get a manual. The manual should tell you what the default password is.

text: I have a hard time making my daughter eat. I have read lots of books but something not working well.? She is 3 and a half, very smart, only child, we have a golden retriever and her mother stays at home, the girl is not going to school yet. I have been a nanny for years and never had a child starve yet. In my studies, I have read that a child will never starve themselves, however, I don't think that I would want to be satisfied with that answer if I was the parent. There could be many reasons why she doesn't eat. n nOne child I worked with had bowel problems. It hurt her to go to the bathroom and she realized that the more she ate the more it would hurt. Please have her checked out by a doctor if you haven't already. n nIf it isn't physical, there could be many other factors. Is she hyper active? Does she snack often? Does she sneak food? Is she easily distracted (more than a normal 3 year old)? Does she have any other behaviors that are abnormal that could be a symptom? Is she emotionally disturbed by anything? Does she seem to be hungry and grouchy or is she normally happy and energetic? n nAnother boy I tended about the same age, had ADD. He could not sit at the table and eat an entire meal. I kept healthy snacks at the table for him and he was not allowed to roam around the house with food. He often like to try to sneak food as well. His parents also thought he wasn't eating, but when I monitored him, he was definitely getting what he needed. n nAlso, in my experience children who are well nourished have plenty of energy and if they get the appropriate amount of rest are generally healthy and happy. Those are things to look for with your daughter. n nIs she a picky eater? Are there lots of foods that she just doesn'

text: Where do people get their ideas about demonology? Does it come from the Bible? I was just looking at this link:n nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006021010935&r=w&is_vote_given=true nnI was amazed at all the detailed and precise descriptions of various demonic figures. Where does all this come from? Fallen Angels, Imps, Demons, Minions, ""textures"" of Satan's body and him having hooves, a tail, etc. Is this in the Bible somewhere?n nWhat amazed me too is that one person would describe a vision of Satan and another would say, ""No that's not Satan you saw, that was an imp."" Or another would say, ""No, that's not Satan you saw, that was one of Satan's minions named Jupiter!""nWhere do people get their information about which is the real Satan? If the source is not the Bible, but visions, then how can one person tell another their vision is wrong?n nWhere are they getting all this? Jupiter? Isn't that a Roman God? Where does the Bible mention imps? When did people find out the names of various demons? Please give me the verses in the Bible. I would honestly be very suspicious of any detailed (physical) descriptions of Satan. Not that I would doubt whether or not the person saw Satan, or that they gave a good description of what they saw, but that Satan appears in various forms is evident, and he is smart enough to appear in whatever form best suits the purpose of the moment.nFirst of all, Satan is both a liar and a spirit being (not limited to a single physical form), and will use whatever (physical) form is best suited to the lie.nSecond, the various'sightings' of Satan may or may not be Satan himself. They could just as well be another fallen angel (demon,

text: Can you ask out girls that you just met five minutes ago? This happens all the time, supposedly. Guys pick up girls in bars five minutes after they meet them...right? n nBut whenever I ask a girl out who I've only known for five minutes, she reacts to me like I'm a complete sociopath, like I have no right whatsoever to even approach her in the first place. n nYes, unlike a lot of guys I have the cajones to approach and ask out women in bars or wherever. It just seems like I have to deal with a lot more rejection than other guys do. And the way they reject me has been pretty harsh to say the least. It's funny with girls. Since it's virtually impossible to know everything about a girl in five minutes, those who you do ask out immediately come to one conclusion: you're asking them out based on physical appearance. Girls simply don't want to go out with a guy who is shallow. But here's the catch...most guys (and girls) are shallow anyway; some are just better at hiding their shallowness.n nMaybe it's not your philosophy to discuss the weather over tea, but if you make more small-talk with the girl you intend to ask out (insert flirting accordingly), then you probably won't get rebuffed so brutally.n nIf the girl still rejects you, then she's either very shy or a snob. Don't sweat it. Move on. But just here to tell you...five minutes ain't going to cut it.

text: what causes elevated liver enzymes? nan Really depends on the clinical scenario and exactly which liver enzymes you are referring to. I would suggest emedicine as a good web resource for you. In general Liver enzymes can be elevated by anything that injures hepatocytes (liver cells). This can be due to infection, decreased blood drainage or decreased blood supply or secondary to a toxin or toxic effect of a medication. Liver enzyme elevation is very nonspecefic. There are also some congenital inborn errors of metabolism that cause elevated enzymes.nA brief list:nCongestive heart failure nHepatitis: viral or autoimmune nTraumanWilson's disease (copper metabolism)nHemochromatosis (iron storage disease)nMetastatic disease or primary liver cancer nMononSome leukemias nShocknGall stones nBlood clots in the liver nSome blood pressure and cholesterol meds ntylenolnseizure meds nalcoholnbirth controll pills nheparinniron pills nanxiety pills naspirinnibuprofen nnThe bottom line is lots of things can cause this and the results need to be looked at in light of the clinical situation and pattern of other lab values. Quite often the cause is not serious but it can be so it is very important to follow up with a qualified medical professional. I hope this helps and would check the emedicine site for more info. Be careful what you learn on non-regulated internet sites like this one.

text: Anybody know anything to help with eczema in a 12 month old!! breaks out all the time and elecon dont help? breaks out bad in creases and around his eyes, he looks like a little raccoon all the time. it has gotten so bad that he cant sleep for all the rashes making him itch. i have brought him to all the doctors and they all tell me there is nothing that they can do, surely somebody knows something out there. Please Help Have you talked to your pediatrician? My 4 month old gets it. They gave us samples of cetaphil. It comes in soap, liquid cleanser, cream, and lotion. I use the soap for bathtime and the cream for afterward and at random times throughout the day. The pediatrician did suggest something else if it got worse or infected, but I cant remember what. Cetaphil is just a mild, scentfree product. It has worked wonders on her skin. We were using aveeno nighttime stuff... babies with sensitive skin probably shouldnt use products with scents, it could inflame the sensitive areas. She also tld me that eczema tends to be heriditary and that it occurs in mostly fairskinned babies/people. Though some babies get it and grow out of it.

text: Are some men really bisexual? It seems to me that most men who say they are bisexual are actually gay but afraid to admit it to themselves. Every man I have ever met who claimed to be bi later confessed to being gay and said they were afraid to ""fully come out."" Some people limit bisexuality to sexual practices, arousal, and attraction only. However like homosexuality and heterosexuality it also includes things such as affection, love, and companionship. True some men use it at as a mere turning point but others are able to be comfortable with both men and women and may not be attracted to both equally and even have a preference. Some men feel that they don't have to choose because people want them to and thus they don't. For example a man can have relationships with mainly men during most his adult life but find a woman who he falls passionately in love with and ultimately spends the rest of life with. He could still be defined as bisexual despite him having a preference.

text: book report help? Band of Brothers : E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest nnI need help on ideas for a book report on this book. n nIf you can please give me a small summery on it In the summer of 1942, young men in Army training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, are given an opportunity to be part of a unique unit of paratroopers. This unit offers $50 dollars a month extra for hazardous duty pay, which draws a lot of the volunteers. These men begin a very rigorous training regimen under Captain Sobel, whom most of the men come to hate. Their training includes basic infantry skills - use and maintenance of various weapons, map reading, communications. They also practice jumping with parachutes, beginning with towers of varying heights, then to the actual jump from an airplane. The hardest part of their training is a run they must make, up to the top of Mount Currahee, which is an Indian name that means We Stand Alone Together. n After several long months of this training, the men of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, are shipped to Uppottery, England, where they continue their training. They are being prepared for the greatest military maneuver ever undertaken; the D-Day invasion of Normandy. The 506 is to parachute behind the German lines and work their way back towards the beach, to meet the Allies there, and hopefully cut off German supply lines to the front in the process. On June 6, 1944, the invasion comes, after having been postponed for bad weather. The drops do not go well, due to anti-aircraft fire and low visibilty, but as the men hit the ground, they begin to regroup, and eventually, the beaches are secured, and the company is under the leadership of Lt. Dick Winters. Now it is time to beat the Germans back to Berlin. n Easy Company does not get much rest after D-Day. They

text: Am i wrong to stop her involvement? Its about time i put my neck out and asked you lot with my issues!nMy Fiance walked out on me when i was 26 weeks pregnant- We already had a 2 year old together. He had been seeing this girl for 2 months before he walked out, she knew me and tried to befriend me before he walked to. i was devastated and i swore to the both of them that i would never let her have anything to do with my kids. (It didnt help that they got engaged on the day i gave birth to my son (3months later). I have never stopped him from seeing the boys but so far i have stopped her. I know it is my personal feelings towards her that are affecting my decision but i cant help but hate her. He has chosen not to see them because she cant be involved, and now the kids are suffering- well my 2 year old, the 3 month old doesnt even know him. -GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT PEOPLE!! If you don't believe that she is a threat to the well being of your children, perhaps its time to let the past go. I know that it's easier to say then it is to do, but little ones need both parents in their lives. Don't think of her as the person responsible for ruining your relationship, instead open yourself to the idea that it's one more person who will love your children. And come on in the end it is only the kids that matter.

My husband and I do not like these relatives and yet he gives them something of mine that my dad left me in the house and I am furious. We have fought, argued and I think he did it to make me mad though he says it is not true. He said I told him to and I did not give him full persmission or even close. I do not want him to even touch me now and I can not stand what he has done. I basically provide everything---he does not work and goes to drug rehab clinic three days a week. I have no nice family and feel so isolated and lost. he is the reason I get up in the morning and we have been friends for oever 13 years and married almost two. I am acting crazy and he is getting emotionally abusive. Yet I need him and love him. I am so messed up! I am so angry about what he did!!!!!! hey, it sounds like you are super hurt and you have every right to be. don't let it consume you. find a way to forgive him, in your own way. one hurt doesn't justify another, right? tell him how you feel and ask him to repeat his understanding of what you said. that way you will know if he is understanding you. most importantly, tell your family that he was not supposed to give that to them and not to ask him for anything they need to come to you. if your hubbie is in rehab, it may be hard for him to stand up to certain people, he may be picking and choosing his battles and this one he may have misjudged. don't fret time heals all wounds. he needs to know you still love him and that you may hold a serious grudge but you still love him!!!!!!!!!! hope all gets better and don't let this be you and his deal

text: Why do cats purr? nan When your cat climbs into your lap, tucks in his paws under himself, and begins to purr, all is right in his world. This is one of the things we love about our cats; that feeling of contentment they share with us. When cats become soft purring bundles of warm reassuring fur, we feel calmer and more peaceful ourselves. We may not always hear the purring – a soft vibrating rumble – but we can feel it. But why do cats purr? And what produces this characteristic sound?n nAccording to veterinarian Bruce Fogle, author of The Cat’s Mind, the original function of purring was to enable a kitten to communicate with his mother that things are well. A kitten is able to purr by the second day of life, and although he can’t meow and nurse at the same time, he can purr and nurse. And the mother cat often purrs back, probably to reassure the kitty.n nThere are many theories to explain how the purr is generated. One study determined that purring involves activation of nerves within the voice box. These nerve signals cause vibration of the vocal cords while the diaphragm serves as a piston pump, pushing air in and out of the vibrating cords, thus creating a musical hum. Veterinarian Neils C. Pederson, author of Feline Husbandry, believes that purring is initiated from within the central nervous system and is a voluntary act. In other words, cats purr only when they want to.n nPurring is an integral part of the feline communication system and occurs for a variety of reasons. It is classified with the “murmur vocalization” group, which involves sounds produced by a cat while the mouth is closed. In addition to purring, this group of sounds includes grunting, calling, and acknowledgment murmurs. Domestic cats and some wild cats, like pumas and mountain lions (almost any big cat that

text: Why are we born with two sets of teeth, baby and adult? nan Almost all mammals have two sets of teeth (this is called diphyodonty). One of the hypothesis to explain the existance of these two dental generations is related to the way our teeth work.nThe teeth of adult mammals occlude (=come together) in very precise patterns that are related to the type of food and the way this food is chewed, and are very important for feeding efficiency. If the definitive teeth were to erupt in a young individual that is still growing, the growth of the skull and jaw bone could make the upper and lower teeth lose their occlusion, with negative consequences.nSo the hypothesis proposes that the first generation or milk teeth appear during the first years (in humans, much earlier in other mammals), when the young one is feeding on breast milk, and then it is not so important that they become separated when the child keeps growing. nOnly then they're replaced by the definitive ones. And remember, only incisors, canines and premolars have two generations. The molars (the most important for mastication) only erupt once, and they do so later, when the person is much more grown. In fact, the last molars or ""wisdom teeth"" sometimes do not erupt at all in humans.n nMore about mammalian teeth, jaws, and milk, at the Animal Diversity Web:nhttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/topics/mammal_anatomy/tooth_replacement.html

text: Do you think SATAN exists? When we presume that god is the ultimate creator of ALL things, dont you think he is responsible for creating evil things too? or does the Satan/Devil co-exist alongwith God? The book of Job suggests that Satan was created by God. He was the greatest of the Angels, and his pride caused him to rebel against God (very similar to the Adam and Eve Story).nEvil is the result of the brokeness of creation. When God created he looked and it was good. The consequences of human rebellion against God lead to suffering and death.n nSo you would be right to thing that God created all things but not that he created evil. The next question however is if God knew that evil would happen why did he still create?

text: principles & introduction of co2 laser? nan The basic physics behind a laser was thought up by Einstein (that guy was everywhere!) but the first ones were not actually built until the middle of the 20th century.n nLaser is an acronym for Light Amplification via Stimulated Emission of Radiation. ""Radiation"" just means light, and ""Stimulated Emission"" is a property of some gases because of Quantum Mechanics.n nIn QM we know that electrons can only be in certain ""orbit"" in an atom, more properly called energy levels. When an electron makes a quantum leap from one energy level to another lower level (assuming there is a lower level) It will release a photon (sort of a piece of light) with a very specific frequency. (Frequency and wavelegth are inversely proportion, so one frequency corresponds to one wavelength.)n nFor example in hydrogen if an electron in the second lowest energy level drops down to the very lowest level it will emit a photon with a wavelength of 656.3 nanometers, which turns out to be reddish light. From the third lowest to the lowest the photon wavelength is 486.1 nm, which is blue green.n nThe point being that an atom can emit light only in very precise frequencies, and not any old frequency.n nEinstein developed the concept of ""stimulated emission"" which is a much more complicated consequence of Quantum Mechanics. It says that if a photon with a transition wavelengh passes close to an excited atom, it will ""stimulate"" the excited atom to also emit at that frequency.n nSo in the hydrogen example, lets say the electron is in the 3rd level. If it were to drop to the lowest level the photon would be 486 nm. While the electron is just hanging around on the third level, if some random photon comes flying past with a wavelength

text: Does it get you mad that I'm burning american flags for flag day? GOOD! SCREW YOU ANYWAY! There's no problem with celebrating your first ammendment rights. You are a patriot, sir. Happy Flag Day! n ndon't forget to buy a gun; turn some soldiers away from your house; don't let those cops in either; and you don't have to tell them what you were doing last night; if they arrest you anyway, make sure they tell you why; and if it goes all the way to court, they had better let 12 regular folks decide the outcome; oh yeah, and they shouldn't beat you.n nSeems like those folks in power at the moment don't really care for the bill of rights so much. Come to think of it, maybe I should buy a flag to burn today while it's still legal. I don't think I'll get around to it though.

text: I don't know how to open up and just have fun. What can I do to change that? I'm quiet and somethimes like annoying. what do I do. I hate when I annoy people cuz I don't know when I am sometimes. i'm really quiet too. i don't think other people think quiet people are annoying, i think they get offended when someone dosn't talk to them. i think to get yourself more social you could think of people that you would want to be friends with and start by nicely smiling at them and sometimes they will start a conversation with you and you can choose if you want to be their friend and if they don't start a conversation with you, you could just say hi and see if they answer.

Is she weird? I really like her, but... is she considered weird? Ooh, and she loves getting dirty and muddy... Not weird at all, Goldfish...in fact, I think you may be describing my ex-wife...Does she have a mohawk hairdo and stinky feet, too?...Just might be her....

text: Can dust devills be dangerous? I live in the Utah desert now, but I'm from Iowa. I miss the midwestern mega-thunderstorms and tornados. Here in Utah, when I'm driving out in the desert, I occasionally might be lucky enough to see a dust devil (mini versions of tornadoes formed from blowing dust and hot air, or something). One time there was one as wide as the highway that crossed the road in front of me. I could see right through it, but it still freaked me out a little, after growing up fearing (and loving) tornados. Can dust devils ever be dangerous? I never heard of them creating problems, but I was just curious. From someone with a similar awe for tornadoes, and one who has yet to see a dustdevil (never been to that part of the country), I really have to say the answer is a pretty much consistant no.n nTornadoes can be much stronger and longer lived because they form in much more persistant conditions and extend from the ground up into the cloud. Dustdevils indeed form due to the temperature differences near very strong convection (heating from the sun). Dustdevils don't last very long and are much shallower. I've never heard of a dustdevil causing damage either (though I suspect occasionally an exceptionally strong one might cause some minor damage similar to an F0 tornado). I've seen videos of kids running and playing in them in a hay field before, so methinks you're right not to be worried about them... though I know I would be equally as wary of them coming from back east!n nHope I helped,nShane
