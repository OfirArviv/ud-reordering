I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something ""better"" is a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ. This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by love. They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. This is not something Christ did. He guided and instructed He didn't seek to destroy the faith He found, He redirected it. This is what I see when people say they ""love"" insert favorite group here>. And I have to laugh at the irony. Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it. Oh, BTW Robert don't take this personally, your post was merely convinent.

All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like 486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

Lines: 11 NNTP-Posting-Host: wampyr.cc.uow.edu.au Keywords: polygons, splitting, clipping The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not necessarily rectangular) as a window. My problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting ""subpolygons"" from the first one. Is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon??? Is there a simpler way?? Comments welcome. Noel.

text: From: kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (Dr Nancy's Sweetie) Subject: Re: Food For Thought On Tyre Summary: Another Inerrantist rewrites the Bible. Keywords: Scripture, implication, prophesy, Woof!' Organization: Rowan College of New Jersey Disclaimer: Brandy the WonderDog hopes his doghouse will be rebuilt. Lines: 93 There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre. In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct. This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists. For example, it sometimes happens that someone says ""My grandson is the cutest baby!"" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says ""Oh! Isn't she the cutest thing!?"" This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first. Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented. Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true. For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not. Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King: > The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the > area[.] No, it implies nothing of the kind. If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say ""Oh, he means that

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing? I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any. I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats. (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers). Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career. Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season. He got 236 PAs

text: From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger) Subject: The Escrow Database. Organization: Partnership for an America Free Drug Lines: 77 Here is a disturbing thought. Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.) Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*106 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes. Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism. With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM expansion slot giving you 4MB.

Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you are using [because that information is usually in the clear]. With clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending clipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself encoded.

Man, I thought people in this net are good with hockey. > I might not be great in Math, but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points > with different record??? Man...retard!!!!!! Can't believe people actually put > win as first in a tie breaker...... Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different. Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (I am starting to sound like Roger or what?) Alan

It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce varous bit-rates.

Their DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't need to play ""two-way-radio"". You can also download code to the DSP subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own vocoder

First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!). The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain. Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no ""unassigned"" (as opposed to ""unused"") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives. W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to ""existing, unused"" drive

People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this. Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it. So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population. We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above). keith

So, I am posting it here so others can read it, check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things. I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register a car) and other proposals regarding'smart' national Identity Cards, wiretap proposals, and such. One simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government. Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful. The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits, IMO.

text: From: srlnjal@grace.cri.nz Subject: CorelDraw BITMAP to SCODAL (2) Organization: Industrial Research Ltd., New Zealand. Lines: 22 NNTP-Posting-Host: grv.grace.cri.nz Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL. Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a few hassles with radial fills. Version 3 RevB is better but if you try to export in SCODAL with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like ""cannot export SCODAL with bitmap""- at least it does on my version. If anyone out there knows a way around this I am all ears. Temporal images make a product called Filmpak which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650 and I was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad cheaper.

One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24? 3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem? How much slower is it? 4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT, or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non- Microsloth) apps, for example)? 5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position, let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

At the 4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson (Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians. UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline. The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University. UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources..... J.D. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Up until I was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. Then I met a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not imposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I'should'. But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of my own personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until I was 23. Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist. This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it. Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) Religion has no place in my system. Tough. Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove it. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. But, for all practical purposes there is no god. Thanqs

If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science. This is where you and I

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish, but there are certainly exceptions. If you write a paper which includes sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is classified. As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is _automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself. I believe you are then not allowed to read your own paper. A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman. The charge is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip. Don't tell

Not necessarily. I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman. If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping? If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories? Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call. Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right? So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified. This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit. It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys. (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.) Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips. It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you

Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS. After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive. I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive. Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...). I then tried to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do. I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for ""Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC"")... Thanks in advance, Paul ""Mr. SCSI... NOT!"" Fincke

I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't know what it looks like either. If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much obliged. Which are free? Which are the best? Which are portable? Which looks nice? Which is not a resource hog? Also, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun, that would be a big help too. Thanks in advance.

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena. You might have to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them. Look on the street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt, or even around Gate 1. The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay, and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time.

Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic. The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment to the Constitution.

I am not really protesting abortion. We are protesting denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech. This judge is trashing the Constitution.'' The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and his father were arrested. Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices. The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent. They also give an example of how to ""emulate"" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent. The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate: new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in "".25"". From reading I thought that what they might actually do is: new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 This results in all the coordinates ending in either ""0.25"" or ""0.75"" whichever is closer. By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses. Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me. Thanks, --Steve squeegee@world.std.com

text: From: greg@Software.Mitel.COM (Gregory Lehman) Subject: Looking for drawing packages Organization: Mitel. Kanata (Ontario). Canada. Lines: 24 Greetings. I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively create/edit/view a visual ""model"" (i.e. topology) of their network, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to simplify this task. In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general. The topology will support objects and connecting links. Once the topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to support grouping, zooming, etc. I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing routines to accomplish this. Specifically, the zooming and grouping aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming, if I have to ""roll my own"". Suggestions? -greg greg@software.mitel.com

Am I mistaken with this understanding? Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice. The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense. However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _

Lines: 22 It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure. It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses. What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses. Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid? In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume. At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip. That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with. -- Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366

I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a little bit long. I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method. It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons. The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand. My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise. When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon. Has anyone heard of this method before? It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it. Libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat. I define myself--tsa@cellar.org

That seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to know if someone has significantly improved on that. I have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but before I spend to much time developing them I wanted to know if someone else has already done the work. ADMINISTRIVIA: I have posted this to three groups and attempted to set the followup to rec.puzzles which seems to me to be the place to continue this discussion. I will cross post a summary when and if it becomes appropriate. Email replies gladly accepted. Jimmy jru@Comtech.com

Keywords: brady handguns s414 hr1025 hr277 instant check waiting period Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest) Distribution: na Lines: 40 Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025). 1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill? What is the status of these bills? I've heard they're ""in committee"". How close is that to being made law? 2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar. Are there any important differences I missed? 3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes: A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?) (S414 has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established, but not before). B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an inaccurate record corrected?) C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member. But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception statement. True? Have I misunderstood? Any other 'holes? 4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to

My only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit, you'd better understand basic military tactics. One cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously. 2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance. When questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily armed. Can you say contradictory? I knew you could! 3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant, hotdoggers. I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes. I'm more than ever convinced that's right on target. An anecdote not related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing. There's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the FBI will not be admissible in court. This is not hearsay. I was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI agent. His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say uncompli

Atoms are not objective. They aren't even real. What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings. All of which is subjective. What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations. There is no objective science. But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist. Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science. This is in contrast to your Objective Morality. There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality. But there exists no objective morality. Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us. In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ). Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe. It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way. I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world. -jim halat

In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this hideous vision of the future. Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets. Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit. NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment!

text: From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler) Subject: Re: SSPX schism? Organization: none Lines: 240 Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon: I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated. But that's really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say? Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law. Here's some of the theology involved for the interested. There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's ""schism""; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between: - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism Take the various classifications of obedience first. There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes: 1) a command 2) the response made to the command As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays. Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around. As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY. Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites: command response name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE COMPLY true obedience ILLEGITIMATE REFUSE true obedience LEGITIMATE REFUSE disobedience ILLEGITIMATE COMPLY false obedience So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from. Obedience is not solely a

text: Got a speeding ticket in Georgia in a rental car, but lost the ticket and don't remember what county/jurisdiction it was in. How do I find out where I got the ticket so I can pay it?. My girlfriend and I live in Washington state. My girlfriend lives here now but still has a Georgia drivers license with an out of date address. While on vacation, in a rental car, she got a speeding ticket which we subsequently lost, and since we were just driving along the interstate I'm really not sure what county we got the ticket in (it wasn't from state patrol). I thought we'd be able to find it in the house, but it's looking less hopeful now...I think the date to pay it is in early December. We don't know who to call or how to find where we got this ticket. Does anyone have any advice on how we can find out where she got a ticket from? We are going to pay the ticket we just can't figure out how.

text: A property management company we rented a house from is requiring we pay to replace a 30 year old shower.. Lemme set the scene: last summer my mom had to stop working as a nurse, as her cancer became terminal and painful. You can't work as a nurse while on as many pain meds as she needed. She was the main provider for our family. Both my Dad and Brother are disabled. Due to problems in the brain area. But, with her disability payments, and our savings, we could make it to the end of our lease in March of this year. And then we were hoping to find somewhere in town to move into that was cheaper. First problem: We lived in northern California. The Camp Fire was one town over from us. Having so many people displaced raised all rents and property value in our town. The cheapest place we could find that would suite my dying mother's needs was around $2,000. Not something we can afford. So we decided to move to where we knew had some friends a couple states over. We found a home to buy that was pretty much perfect and in our price range, but it would take most of our savings to actually move us there. So now, after moving, we are pretty much broke. Second problem: A couple weeks before we moved out, my brother accidentally slipped and fell in the shower. He is 19, and lean, and has a harder time with coordination because of his autism. The fiberglass shower is 30 years old and obviously wasn't in the best shape when we moved in. He hit his back on the tub part and cracked it probably about 6 inches. We notified the property management, and they sent someone to look at it. They said it was unrepairable, and needed to be replaced. Fast forward to a couple days ago. We have moved into our new house. My mom has been in and out of the hospital a lot. She is in very bad shape. The property management company sent us some paperwork with the estimate they got for a new shower, and they are expecting us to pay ALL of it. All $3,975 of it. For a brand new shower. It wasn't even the bill. Just one estimate

text: A big company that me and millions of other people are currently working for is threatening to severely cut hours if we don’t meet weekly sales quota for a new product.. I know there’s not much I can do if there’s no evidence behind this, and as far as I know, no hours have been cut yet and no terminations have been made yet. We’re a pharmacy/retail company, so it’s natural to have things to upsell, that I understand. This has never been an issue in the past, up until now. The company has released a new product that probably costed them millions to introduce, and they’re not seeing good numbers, so they’re threatening each store with cut hours, and even termination if we don’t meet a certain quota within each day. This product is much like Amazon Prime, but not quite. It’s not a necessity to many people in our store and it’s very evident that lots of people really don’t want it. Is this necessarily legal? I know nothing about business workings so it could be totally legal, but I’d like to know in order to further put in my two weeks or speak to someone else about this.

text: My Apartment complex broke our lease agreement... I think. I'm looking for possible verification.. So I actually made a previous post about this complex [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9lfpss/old_apt_management_is_saying_our_pet_deposit_was/) where I basically rant about the over arching issue I'm having, which is them trying to get us to pay for carpet replacement that we really shouldn't have to pay for. However, what brings me to writing this post was, as I was looking through our lease agreement (trying to see if they specify our Pet Deposit as a ""Pet Fee"" or not) I noticed an instance where THEY may have violated the lease. Allow me to explain: Back in December of last year, Management upped our rent by about 3-6 dollars (I can't remember the exact amount right now, it was enough to notice, but not enough to be upset about). At the time it didn't mean anything to me, and their reasoning was it was for added cable benefits (the complex has a contract with Spectrum to be the sole providers for internet and tv available for tenants. Furthermore, the cabling to include these ""benefits"" resulted in our apt. being flooded, but that's a separate story). However reading through the lease just now, I came across paragraph 16, which states: &amp;#x200B; ""No rent increases or lease changes are allowed before the initial lease term ends, except for those allowed by special provisions in paragraph 9, by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us, or by reasonable changes of apartment rules allowed under paragraph 19."" (paragraph 19 is mostly about consequences of violating rules such as ""no glass containers in pool area"") Par. 9 states "" The following or attached special provisions and any addenda or written rules furnished to you at or before signing will become a part of this lease and will supersede any conflicting provisions of this printed lease form."" &amp;#x200B; Also worth not

text: Overly-broad assignment of rights and limitation of recourse. Fist time posting, so I'll do my best to keep this as specific as possible without identifying companies or individuals. Background: My SO has accepted a position during an M&amp;A deal to move to a new company and the new company has some bizarre (in my opinion) media/image/information rights assignments tied with a clause to not sue and unconditionally indemnify the company regarding enforcement of the contract. The contract demands enforcement in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (where I believe the division, though not the company, is headquartered). Key issues I have: 1. Assignment of all film, photographic, audio, and mixed media rights ""in perpetuity, throughout the universe"" (and yes, this verbiage is in the contract) without limitation to the new employer and its licensees 2. Agreement that the company and its licencees can release any information about my SO including but not limited to images, film, media, and PII information (specifically stated as name, location, and other related information). 3. Agreement that my SO has no rights to review any media or information released prior to doing so and no right to limit that release. 4. Agreement that no legal action can be brought related to the contract and to indemnify company if action is brought or if SO violates the contract and the company chooses to pursue legal action. In my opinion based on dealing with overly-broad rights assignments related to my own work and working with a lawyer to redline them in the past, I think the thing is unenforceable as written because it's too broad, however I have redlined specific sections and advised her that we need to get a lawyer to actually review the contract and to return a signed, redlined copy noting that our attorney is also going to be doing a review. The only reason I have suggested returning it at all is because they're pressuring her to do so as a condition of employment after the M&amp;A process is completed. I'd really love any feedback on this that I can get.

text: Can I be banned from smoking at my own frontdoor?. Hi, I understand how incredibly menial this is - but - I frequently go downstairs to smoke a cigarette with my girlfriend, as do several others in our building. Its a small building in Amsterdam and the bottom floor (where the door/outdoor porch and bench are) is next to a store. The stairs to our apartment are not part of the property of this store, from my understanding. Several times they have told us that there is too much mess from cigarette butts, but we never leave any. It’s a very touristic area and most of the people who smoke here are not living in the building or even Amsterdam. Today they took photos of us for leaving ash on the floor. It was a very small amount and would typically be blown away by the wind. They threatened us today with invoices for cleaning bills, took our apartment number and are contacting the owner of the building. Are we actually doing anything wrong?

We moved in a year ago, our lease is up soon, we havent violated any lease terms or made any late rent payments, but our landlord hates us. What happened is someone left a note about the parking in a neighbors mailbox and smeared dog shit on the inside, the neighbors were baffled and took it to our landlord (who is the tennant on the other half of our duplex). He assumed it was us and screamed at us about it without even considering our assertions that we were not involved. To make matters worse I accidentally spilled oil im the driveway and it had to be repaved. He has been very aggressive and has tried intimidating us and we had to call the police more than once to have them speak to him to warn him to stop being physically aggressive. Now our lease is up and we are in the process of finding a new place, but when i explain to prospective landlords that we dont have a good reference from our current landlord it doesnt seem to go over well. Im afraid this will prevent us from getting a lease anywhere, what should we do? We are honest people and the idea of lying about anything gives me anxiety but we need a new place. If we were to give a friends name and number and have them pose as our landlord would there be anything on our background checks that would show we lied?

text: I want to break my lease because there is a peeper/stalker harassing myself and my neighbor.. I have 11 months to go in my lease with a huge corporate company in VA. My neighbor reported months ago a guy was stalking her that she didn't know. He would follow her home and wait outside the door. She would call the police and every time the guy managed to get away. He would say obscene stuff to her and one time tried to open her patio door. Recently, I was followed home by a guy who matches the same description. He made comments to me as well and walked so close to me I thought he was going to grab me. He ran away when another neighbor stepped off the bus and walked with me. I called the police and filed a report. I'm scared to leave my house alone now. Especially as Winter is coming and its dark when I leave for work and sometimes at night when I get home. I know there is a penalty of a few months rent to break my lease but I'm curious if I provide them with the police report, will they let me break my lease without paying all 3 months? Is there any legal recourse I have? Additionally, a man I don't know was found sitting in my car a few months ago. My neighbor saw him come into our parking lot and go straight for my car. He sat in the drivers seat (I accidentally left it unlocked or he found the key fob that had fallen of my key chain a few weeks before) the cops were able to catch him and charge him with vehicle trespassing. So I have that report as well. I pay a ton in rent and I don't even feel safe in my apartment.

So a few weeks ago I was meeting with a representative of one our clients and she rubbed me the wrong way (disheveled and disorganized, seemed to be under the influence). Taking this as an indication of the company’s competency, I decided to not invest in her company. Well this turned out to be the right move, as almost immediately after the decision was made her company went nearly bankrupt due to a scandal breaking regarding the company’s practices. So I felt good, thinking that I saved my company a great deal of money. Well not long after, I was informed that the SEC was investigating me for insider trading. The thing is, I had no idea about the scandal and no non-public information was revealed at the meeting. Moreover, apparently the representative was interviewed and claimed she did reveal non-public information to me. I don’t know what she could have to gain from this, it could have been spite, but my world is crashing around me. I’m working on getting a lawyer, but what steps should I be taking?

text: Tenant-at-will security deposit question. Hello everyone, I'm writing from Brooklyn, NY here. I have a question about getting my security deposit back. I rented a room from a man who lived in the back room, and he required first month's rent and a security deposit. We didn't go into the specifics of the security deposit at all, so I took it to mean insurance against physical damage to the room. About nine months later, I decided to move out, since I found a cheaper room for rent in the same neighborhood. This was in May. Finding housing is notoriously difficult in New York City, but I was able to find a place around May 17th or so, and told the man I was renting from that I would be moving out at the end of the month. He had about twelve days notice. He told me that he was going to keep the whole security deposit because I didn't give him at least 30 days of notice. I thought this was unfair, because there was never a written or even oral agreement that I had to give him a certain amount of notice before leaving in order to get my security deposit back. But he said that he had talked to his lawyers about it, and that they assured him he was in the right. I should add that there was absolutely no physical damage to the room I rented, and I was a respectful, quiet roommate/tenant. He is in his 60s, and I am in my 20s, so he probably thought he could just get away with it, and he turned out to be right. I considered bringing it to small claims court, but I had never brought suit or been involved in any court room procedure at all, and didn't proceed with it. However, it was a considerable amount of money, $1250, and I think I deserve it. My question is--do I have a case? And if so, how should I go about trying to get my money back? And would the costs of bringing the lawsuit cost more than I would be getting? Thanks for anyone with knowledge who can help--it is much appreciated!

text: [AZ] Salary but paid hourly?. I work at a consulting firm that says I'm salary but when I recently needed a sick day they stated it comes off of my ""PTO"" time (personal time off). I originally thought PTO was vacation, but I soon learned that was both vacation/sick days combined for a total of 2 weeks and 1/2 a day. I was confused at first cause they stated I had to log every working hour including PTO hours (which PTO is understandable). When I said well I'm salary so if I miss one day it doesn't change my weekly pay, HR said that they would deduct a whole day of pay for me if I don't deduct it from PTO. I was told although I'm classified as salary I'm really hourly and the only difference between myself and real hourly employees (who do exactly what I do with same title) is that if they work over 40 they get overtime in their paycheck, and if I work over 40 I'll get half of my OT in the form of a bonus every 6 months. This company has less than 30 people if it matters. Also their policy states that FMLA is only 6 weeks non paid, I'm assuming this is fine because they don't have more than 50 employees? My questions are if my classification is accurate and if how they are handling sick/vacation/overtime correct?

After checking my apartment and not seeing any trace of bugs, I went to get a generic raid fogger from Walmart. And wouldn’t you know it, when I flipped over my box spring and there was a tiny larvae. I immediately proceeded down the hall to my property manager office/apartment and asked if there were bed bugs in the building. Her response “yes, but not on your side”. Now I’m gonna editorialize here and say she communicates EVERYTHING ELSE TO TENANTS but not a peep about this. Don’t believe me? Here is an example of her text blasts to all of us: [texts from landlord](https://imgur.com/a/CA7P187) So she’s told me that she had a dog sniff the outside of our apartments to detect bedbugs and the dog did not indicate my apartment had them. To her credit, she did schedule pest control to come out on Tuesday. My question is: what is the typically procedure for required for this situation because it seems she’s only spot treating apartments and not the entire building. And since bugs travel when they’re trying to be murdered, I feel like I’m going to have to deal with this forever (well, until my lease ends in September 2019). Can I break my lease over this? What are my rights? Any advice you have would be helpful. Thank you so much!

text: “You’ll get a ticket in the mail”. While parked with my hazards on to go vote, a traffic guard asked me which car was mine and that I would get a ticket in the mail for being illegally parked. He floated about how much the ticket would cost me. He then pulled into the spot where I had been parked and stayed parked there. What is the likelihood that he will actually honor this verbal reprimand by reporting me later, and could I get it dismissed if I have photos of his car parked in that spot?

text: [IA] I think my landlord may be charging me extra fees sneakily. My two roommates and I own an apartment in the state of Iowa, and this place seemingly isn’t managed very well. Along with that, this is in a college town so I have an irking suspicion they are trying to milk the tenants thinking they don’t care enough to check up on it. Anyways... I have been late on my rent the past couple months due to working a pretty low paying job and always being *just* a step behind with my paychecks. Understandably, I’ve accrued late fees, which I have no problem paying considering I was late on my rent. However, along with the $100 late fees I’ve been receiving $40 “3 day notice” fees, which aren’t shown on the lease. Today I met with their office and they explained how some fees aren’t listen on the lease and I would have to reference the Iowa Rental Law, which I complied with and said I would look up. After looking through the [Iowa Rental Laws](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/Legis_Guide/2013/LGLSL004.PDF#page5), as far as I can tell, there is no inclusion of these spontaneous fees and a google search found no one in a similar position. Hopefully someone can help me out whether I’m misguided or not because the uncertainty of this $40 is a pretty big stress for someone working full time and still living paycheck-to-paycheck, especially when we are trying to re-sign for the upcoming year before someone sweeps the unit from under us, as the landlord said there is nothing they can do to help us secure the lease if someone tries to claim it before us. Thanks for reading... TL:DR; Landlord in Iowa is charging fees *certainly* not on the lease, and from what I can tell not included in Iowa Rental Law.

text: (TX) wife hit me and I had her arrested for domestic violence.. Like the title states. After a month of on/off superaran, I came to mine and my wife’s home yesterday to attempt a final chance at reconciling. While here we began to argue, and she started hitting me repeatedly. Because of not wanting to leave in the middle of the night with my 2 year old daughter I stayed at the apartment. Today, I called and made a police report, they came and took pictures and later arrested my wife. In the process of, they asked if I wanted a protective order, and I said I just wanted to be sure nothing happened again. Officers took that as a no and didn’t apply for one in the warrant they issued. I called the police to try and get the protective order added on, and they weren’t clear on wether or not it could happen. We have a 2 year old little girl, and my fear is that she’s going to take the baby and disappear; or that she’s going to come back and be violent towards me in front of the child again. Being that tomorrow is Sunday. What are my options? How hard is it to apply for a protection order for me and my child to ensure that she cannot do this again.

text: Need some advice regarding a motorbike fine.. Hi guys, first time poster but long time lurker, wondering if you could help me. Backstory: I had a motorbike I bought, however the guy at the shop registered the bike with an incorrect surname, for the sake of it let's say my surname is Marcy, but the bike had been registered to Tracey. Fast forward 6 months my bike gets stolen. It gets recovered with damage, I leave it off road but (important part) forget to SORN it, completely my fault and I happily hold my hands up. A bailiff turns up at my door last week as I had forgot about it, I had just finished a night shift and just got into bed when the door knocks. The bailiff proceeds to explain why he's here (was being very nice), as we are talking I explain to him that writ is for Tracey, not marcy therefore I'm not liable at that time. Here's the fuck up but granted I'll be honest when it's due, I told him the situation and said I'm happy to pay if they can give me some flexibility considering its Christmas. I was willing to make two minor payments now and December (70-75 each month) and then in January and Feb pay large amounts (200-250), the fine total is 600 odd. I'm not willing to pay large amounts at this time of year to a council organisation, they don't need the money and no one will have a shit Christmas if I don't pay them. I'm asking for legal advice as to how the bailiff and the company can go about getting the name changed on the writ? The bike was never registered to my correct name, my first name and address are correct but surname is totally different, how do they go about getting my name changed and can they legally enforce this against me? I'm happy to pay so I won't be trying to get out of this at all, if the company offered me flexibility id be more inclined to pay without, but the bailiff essentially told me he wants two installments before Christmas,

text: Still getting bills from an accident that was almost a year ago???. So I was in a car accident about a year ago (April 15, 2018). I was hit by a drunk driver (of a stolen car) with minor injuries, and the billing went through the car owner's insurance (or so I thought). I thought everything was settled and paid for last year, and I've been getting what I thought were scam letters/bills in the mail over the past 2 months related to my visit to the emergency room after the accident. I called my car insurance provider, USAA, who told me I still owe around $2,000 for the medical bills, even though I was told that Geico handled it and everything was settled. How is this possible almost a year later? Please help! (I can provide more information as needed.)

text: Will Executor and Beneficiary live Out of State (I live in WA). How to reduce hassle to both?. Hello, Here's my situation: Single person living in WA state. Significant financial investments, all of which are stock market type items (mutual funds, 401-k, etc.) No real-estate. Low-value personal belongings (furniture, electronics, office equipment, sporting goods, older car, etc.) My executor (father) lives out of state. My main beneficiary (mother) lives out of state. My Wishes: I want my Mother (out of state) to get all the money from my investments. I want my various friends who live in WA to get all my physical belongings if they want them (car, books, cd's, etc.) I don't want my Mother or Father to be bothered by having to come to WA to do the cleanup of things here, i.e. liquidating my belongings, etc. I do have a local friend who is willing to be that person who will distribute my ""stuff"" and donate the rest, clean out my apartment, etc. HERE'S THE QUESTION: Can/should I create a Will designating that EVERYTHING goes to my Mother, with an attached letter indicating that I RECOMMEND/REQUEST (legally binding?) she work with my local friend to liquidate all my stuff? And part of that attached letter would be a list of all my local friends to be contacted to see if they want any of my stuff. NOTE: I've spoke to my Mother about this and she is fine with handing off the responsibility of liquidating my stuff to my local person. I'm leaning this way for the sake of simplicity, i.e. everything goes to one person for the sake of legality, as opposed to making the Will much more complex by stating that the $$$ goes to my Mother, kayak goes to so-and-so, books and music goes to so-and-so. That just seems messy. Also, I would like the local friend to get X amount of money for their time

text: Texas Deed Restrictions on county land - How likely would Courts/Sheriff enforce?. I'm looking to buy land in Texas under county jurisdiction. I was told by county officials that one can do just about anything as long as drainage and health concerns are met, which I assume are enforced by the county fire marshall, the sheriff and the courts. But those darn deed restrictions.. Written in 1971, they state ""..no temporary buildings shall ever be erected on such land, or trailer house or mobile home used or occupied on such land, the construction of living quarters being limited to permanent dwellings of no more than two family type with a minimum of 1,000 square feet of enclosed living space per family."" The land is undeveloped. We want to develop it, so we'll get the required construction permits. And common sense should tell the neighboring land owners that we'll probably need some trailers, mobile units, etc. during the construction phase(s). So the nightmare situation is someone complains, the court files some action, the sheriff visits us and tells us to remove the mobile units, effectively shutting down everything. Any anecdotal experience in these scenarios with the courts and sheriff? Any other ways to interpret the restrictions? Any creative solutions? Thanks in advance!

text: Suspended from work for possible harassment. Coworkers now sharing personal details concerning the matter ruining my reputation. Lot to unpack here.. A little history on my situation: A couple of years ago I was arrested for a sex crime. It was a (whichever is the lowest degree) felony, which I pleaded down to a misdemeanor, with probation and sex offender treatment. Let’s just say there are certain places you shouldn’t hook up with your girl, and leave it at that. I lost my job, my home, my friends (most of whom didn’t know what happened and assume in some kind of predator) and every ounce of integrity I had. Things were looking dark, and it was about a year before I was able to find a job. I was hired to a new place late last year, and made sure to have it on file in both my cover letter and vocally during my interview with the manager, asst, manager, and store manager at the time, that I was in the particular situation I was in. A year into my employment, with no notes in my file, exemplary work performance reviews, and a very good track record of advancement. I poured every ounce of my experience, talent, and business skills into this position. I reached high, didn’t let anyone down, and did my job better than anyone there before me. I was even promoted two weeks ago. Last week, I’m pulled into the office, told I’m being investigated for harassment, and told I’m being put on suspension with pay pending an investigation. No details, no questions, just out. I asked a work friend of mine if she knew what was going on, and she said someone had been spreading an article posted by my local news outlet about my initial arrest. The article was packed with things they got completely wrong, including the charges, and false information on my background and the details of the case. I’ve tried contacting them multiple times to take the story down or at least get the info right and they refuse each time. Her claim, while disturbing, didn’t sound like the story my manager gave me.

text: Is it illegal to request and receive nudes?. I'm writing this on a burner account because I definitely don't want this associated with me in any way. I am wondering if it is illegal to request a specific someone's sexual photographs or videos and receive them so long as they are not shared by me. Meaning that if I requested to see or have someone else's nude photographs and I received them without the consent of whom those photographs are of, could there be any legal repercussions? This is assuming that I receive this content and do not share it with anyone else. It goes to me and I keep what I receive for myself. Is there any legal issues with this? I ask because there are numerous threads and posts on various pornographic websites in which nudes are uploaded illegally and it can be very hard to tell if that is the case sometimes. I know morality is certainly an issue here but I am asking strictly about the legal repercussions that could occur from this. And obviously, I am referring to pictures of adults, nothing that would be inherently illegal no matter the case. edit: I am from the United States but to retain anonymity, I will list four possible states I could be in.

text: Possible eviction situation, does the owner have grounds?. IMPORTANT! I receive public funding for my housing. For the past two years I have diligently notified my buildings office manager and placed several requests for my leaky window to be repaired or replaced. On their end there was no acknowledgement, even after explaining the leak was beginning to cause water damage to both the management company and office manager. There has been no communication on their end for the majority of this time. It was not until I requested an inspection from my housing authority (that they recommended I do), and rent payment was being delayed that a manager of several properties owned by the company came by to examine my window. He stated my window and patio would be replaced. A month and a half went by after this despite being told the ordering of parts would take two weeks. Contractors came by a day or so ago, installed the new patio and prepared to do the same with my bedroom window. No one told them about the water damage or lead paint (my building was constructed in 1975). I was told the work would need to be done in steps and that they would return tomorrow (which they didn't). My patio and window did not pass the housing authority inspection, which is a condition of the contract signed by myself and the owner (by proxy, the office manager). Today I received a call, and had a conversation with my office manager that was definitely a veiled threat. She was pressuring me to sign paperwork essentially stating the work was complete, and multiple times stated if it was not signed, I would need to find a new place to live. Until the repair is finished, my rent will not be paid, that is literally what the barrier is. I told her I needed to communicate with the housing authority about the situation before signing off and ensuring that both parties are communicating with each other. What I want to know is, can I be evicted? I want to state I live in the U.S. and in the state of Minnesota. I am so stressed, have done nothing wrong and until I moved into this apartment, I was homeless for an entire year and before that a domestic situation. I am just so afraid of being displaced again.

I was 22 and she was 19 at the time. This happened 8 months ago. February 14th. Valentine’s Day. Me and this girl met online and we live a few miles from each other. I talked to her for a bit and we ended up meeting to eat one night. Well that night she invited me to meet her family and I decided okay let’s do it I enjoyed spending time with this girl. She has a large family. 4 Sisters, nieces and nephews that live with them. They all seemed to like me. Iv met a few of her sisters at the local casino before too. One of her sisters boyfriends was even a cop from my hometown and I met him too. We would always hang out at her house with her family and watch movies and have family parties and they would always want me to come over. She’s a gamer so we had a connection there too and her nephew had gotten a gaming computer but was unable to play most games because he didn’t have a powerful card or power supply so I ended up giving him parts out of one of my computers and set it up for him and everything. I was generous and always nice and considerate and we never fought or had any relationship issues. Well now it’s Valentine’s Day. I’m running a little late but get to her house at 6:30. This is where I get to give her gifts I had bought her. Card, flowers, gift card, and also a good night out. We leave after a little bit and go to eat. After eating we drive like 30 min away to go see a movie. Well turned out black panther didn’t come out till the next day so we decide to go back home. Once we get back to our town she gets a call from her sister and she’s asking what

My sister is still legally married to a man who ended up being a deadbeat. They are not together romantically (separated about 5 years), and my sister is living with her boyfriend, with whom she shares a 4-year-old son. She has a daughter from Deadbeat. Before they broke up, he became abusive and an addict. Mostly pills, but we suspect harder drugs. He was never able to hold down a job and was in and out of his parents' house. The last I heard about him, his mother had paid for him to get treatment out of state and to live at a group home of some sort, I don't have exact details. He ended up breaking the rules of the home and was kicked out, we haven't heard of his whereabouts since then. He isn't accessible by phone or Facebook, his mom doesn't even know where he is. At this point, my sister and our family are done with him. She has never received any child support money from him because he doesn't have any income. She is given a few dollars here and there from Deadbeat's Mom out of guilt, but it's not a formal arrangement. My sister just wants to be free to continue her life without being legally tied to this man, perhaps marry her boyfriend. This is hard to do without knowing where he is, plus she doesn't have extra money for an attorney. Are there any options she could explore? Can she divorce him without papers? There must be recourse for situations like this. I just want my sister and my niece free of this scumbag.

text: Help dealing with NYC lead laws. Back in January my youngest son tested slightly high for lead. His levels were not of concern to our pediatrician as he only just passed the threshold for what's considered high. Skip a week, I get a call from NYC DOH saying they wanted to come test my home for lead. It was free, 100% voluntary and really no big deal. The woman on the phone made it seem like I should just do it out of curiosity so I did. I grew up in this house and our older soon was born here. Neither of us ever had any lead issues so I was pretty sure the house wasn't the problem. The next week these people showed up and tested every surface, my cooking spices, opened my cabinets looking for vermin and asked questions about my dog and parenting; it was far from the informal nonchalant visit the woman told me to expect. More than two months later I get a notice from the city that certain walls tested positive for lead and an order of lead abatement. It says that I either need to hire a contractor to abate the lead within the next 5 days or contest it at my own expense within the next 3 days or request a loan from the city and have them abate the lead. We can't afford any of these options. We are a working class family of 4 with 1 on the way and every penny we earn is accounted for. Contractors are giving us quotes of 9k and better and telling us that the city definitely charges more than that. I'm wondering if we can just do the work ourselves and fight this in court. My husband is a construction contractor he's just not EPA certified and I'm hoping that if the city takes us to court we can make our case saying we did everything within our financial means to comply. We could show that our son's levels are normal and so is everyone else's. The walls test negative now (which we will pay to have retested after we finish the work) and the violations are treated. I figure if the issue is the violations and the lead levels and we address that it won't be a problem, right? What are my options here?

text: Will overstaying in the US affect my chances of getting a Canadian student visa?. Throwaway for personal reasons. I'm 18 years old and I'm currently in Bangladesh. I overstayed in the US on a B1 visa from 2001 to 2008 and have probably received a 10 year bar (I was a minor so I'm not sure if I have one). I've applied to US schools and have gotten accepted by some of them, but my F1 visa was denied as I was deemed ineligible, despite having left the US for 11 years as a minor. Will my travel history raise a red flag for when I apply for a Canadian visa? Will this be seen as ""immigrant intent""?

text: May have to break my lease. What’s the best way to go about it?. Long story short my fiancé and I live in PA and want to move into a house but currently we are renting an apartment with the lease ending in 8 months. Now they have a clause in the lease which I will write below but I am not entirely sure what it means. We don’t want to continue paying for an apartment when that money could be going to a house so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Clause After giving sixty days written notice, Resident may terminate this lease at any time during the first six months and be released from all terms and conditions of this agreement by paying a sum equal to three months rent, and during the second six months by paying a sum equal to two months rent. During any renewal term of the lease, resident may terminate the lease by paying a sum equal to one month rent after giving sixty days written notice to owner. If sixty days written notice is not given, per diem charge will be based on the total current monthly rent payment. The sum paid as liquidated damages is in addition to the monthly rentals due to the date of termination. All monies are due with final rent payment prior to residents removal from the premises.

text: Landlord wants us to move out. This is in Long Island, NY. We're students living in a house and our lease expired in september but our landlord let us stay 2 more months (paying obviously) since we let her know in advance. We thought we would have to move because one of our roommates said he was leaving so we needed to go to a smaller and cheaper house. Turns out he's staying after all. Landlord said new tenants already signed the lease and gave a security deposit so we have to move out by October 31st. We said we wanted to stay and keep paying rent. What are our rights here? Do we have to move out or can we stay in the house while paying rent? What would happen if we just stayed in the house while paying rent and refused to leave?

text: GDPR data breach?. Going through a shared drive on my computer in work I came across a folder called “absences”. Inside contained a spreadsheet outlining any dates an employee on our team was off sick and whether it was certified or uncertified by a doctor. This drive is accessible to all members of my team and one or two people outside my team. I have no issue with my absences being listed for all to view, but surely having them labelled as certified or not is a data breach? I would have thought only my manager should have access to this information. Am I wrong here? I am currently lodging formal grievance against my manager for other issues and wonder should this also be highlighted! I am located in Ireland so would be under the new EU GDPR regulations.

text: [MT] Ex-Husband trying to grant access to child's education records. My ex-husband and I have been divorced for over a year now. Parent-teacher conferences are approaching and he is trying to bring his current girlfriend to the meeting. I have no problem with him sharing information directly with her after the meeting, but I do take issue with her being in the meeting because my child's performance and education records are not her concern. I have a couple of questions with respect to restricting third parties, like a girlfriend, from attending parent-teacher conferences: 1. The school principal told me he could bring whoever he wanted to the meeting, referencing a buddy from a bar. Wouldn't this be a FERPA violation because a third-party is receiving information about a student's educational history *directly* from the teacher who is required to keep that information confidential? 2. Can my ex unilaterally grant a third-party access to education records? I have primary physical custody and we consult on all other major decisions, but our divorce agreement does not explicitly address similar situations. The school district requires written consent to extend third-party access. 3. If this is a violation and he does end up bringing his girlfriend to the conference, is there an appropriate avenue to seek recourse? Or is this such small-potatoes that it's not worth pursuing? Thank you in advance for any advice.

text: Girlfriend has Influenza, strep, and a possibilty of bronchitis. Has a doctor's note saying she can't work, but nobody will help her. (Not sure what flair to put for this).. So my girlfriend got sick and as the title says above, a whole lot worse than expected. She's a caretaker for people with disabilities which requires her to take care of them at their homes for long shifts. She went to the emergency ER this morning when she got diagnosed and some prescriptions. She was given a note saying that she can't work. Her boss basically has blown it off as her problem and no other employees will cover her. I don't think she meets the requirements in our state (Ohio) quite yet for FMLA so I'm here kind of desperate for options for her. She can barely move and I dont think its wise for her to take care of people when she's extremely contangious with something like the flu with strep on top of it. Are there any legal options she can take so she can recover?

text: I believe my employer violated ADA and my set appointments for treatment (Mental Illness) am I wrong?. I suffer from PTSD and MDD which has a variety of symptoms like insomnia for example. My schedule I had my two therapy appointments set on my days off. Two things, my job works on a point system for attendance etc. Once you reach 9 points you are terminated. You can roll off a point by working 6 hours of OT so 40 hrs + 6. Or a month of perfect attendance. Now the paperwork my healthcare providers filled out stated I am unable to work or highly recommended to not exceed 32 hours a week. Making me unable to actually work any OT to take a point off if needed. As for the month of perfect attendance, it is very likely I will have an appointment I won’t be able to get on an off day and will need to miss some work. I talked to HR and they said I’m pretty much SOL with rolling off points unlike the rest of the employees can do making my job unstable. Now I work at a large company who sent out an email asking if employees who don’t work Fridays and work Sundays if they would be willing to switch that. Now I’m off Fridays one of my set appointment days for therapy. I emailed stating I would be happy too only if I can find another day for that appointment. I wasn’t I let them know and they switched it anyways. I let my supervisor know even before it took place I could not. I told HR, my supervisor requested for A WHOLE MONTH. Not only did they not know I could not work that full shift (long commute and long appointment) but still had me scheduled 1-10pm when at 3pm is my appointment. Not only did that cause financial issues but caused my symptoms to worsen making me miss more days. Finally I got fed up and went to the site director who was astonished it wasn’t changed yet and got it switched back the next day. I felt like I was owed money for part of my hours being placed on a day I could not work I was upset. But also I got POINTS

text: (WI) Would this be considered a form of police torture? Do I have any recourse?. I'll try to keep this short. This was approx 5 years ago so I assume I no longer have a leg to stand on, but I am still curious. A few years ago I was living with a few friends. This particular weekend I had been out of town visiting family. I come back on Sunday night to hear that a different friend (not a roommate) had passed away from a drug/alcohol related overdose. I find out from my roommate (Lets call him 'A') that he had given the deceased a pill earlier that day that may have contributed to the overdose. We realize in an hour or so that the cops will be coming, probably to arrest my roommate, and potentially ask me questions. That night, cops come with a warrant, and take myself and two roommates into custody. A is taken in a separate vehicle and I never found out where he ended up. My other roommate (Lets call him 'B') and I are taken into two separate but adjacent holding cells. Once we are placed here B and I start talking, we can't believe we're being held, we both begin to discuss whether we had any sort of contraband in our rooms / the apartment that would get us in trouble, etc. After ten minutes of us discussing an officer says we are not allowed to communicate. The same officer brings a radio, places it on a stool in between our cells, turns the radio to static, and blasts it on as loud as possible. B and I were submitted to this for over 5 hours, (11pm - 4am) with the only break when I was asked questions by detectives. My question, was any of this legal? Was I allowed to be detained for no reason? (probably since I was released within 6 hours) Is it legal for them to blare static the way they did? thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any response TL;DR - Cops placed me in a holding cell and blared static over a radio into my cell.

text: Someone took my picture after I passed them driving, what can come of this? [FL]. I was trying to get around someone while driving, because the flow of traffic on one side of the road was going much faster than them and I was approaching an area where were likely going to be passed by most of them. I was trying to get over into the other lane, and to do this I was tailgating them for a couple seconds (10-20 max) then I got into the other lane, the person in front of me passed them, then I passed them. I thought nothing of it. I was probably driving over the speed limit to do this, but not by enough to say it was reckless. Then I get to a stop light and I look to my right and they're in the turn lane with their phone out the window trying to take my picture or video me or something. It really freaked me out, it was just for a second, but I don't know if they somehow got their phone out and taped the whole thing or what. I have no prior tickets or anything, and I'm worried that he's going to be able to report the video and try to say I'm driving recklessly. I'm terrified of what he's going to do. I'm in Florida if that helps, I just want to know what I can expect him to do. I'm really scared.

text: Stepbrother got fired?. Short and sweet post. So, my stepbrother (18 years old) got a job working at Birdsong Peanuts here in South Georgia. He worked 68 hours last week, and about 45 hours this week. Essentially yesterday he passed out at work (due to heat exhaustion) and was sent home. Today he found out he had been fired before he was able to go to work. I understand the company usually decides things like this, but is there anything we can do? Not necessarily legal actions of course, but something a little more...minor? Because I feel like it’s unfair for someone to be worked so hard, pass out at work, then get fired the next day.

text: Butler co Ohio. I'm a renter in an apartment complex. I need advice.. I'm in Butler county Ohio. I rent from a complex who's owners are a company out in California. Here lately I've been noticing that the apartment manager and apartment maintenance man are rarely on site. More often than not when I go to the office on site the door is locked and the light is out. They even gone as far to remove the office hours that used to be posted. Today I woke up to the sound of water leaking from the apartment above me. I quickly put buckets down and called the office. I got the answering machine. The machine gave me an emergency number to call in case of emergencies. I called it and it took over an hour to get a maintenance man to the apartment above mine to stop the leak. My carpet, clothes, and other items got soaked in the meantime. According to the maintenance guy the apartment manager will be sending out a cleaning crew to clean up the mess in my apartment at their expense. As of now I'm not noticing any major damage to anything I own other than some clothes got soaked and I'll have to clean them. I did have a few boxes of collectables get wet but the damage seems to be mostly to the boxes themselves. So my question is. As a renter do I have any legal argument that there should be a manager and maintenance man on site every day? The fact it took an hour to get get a maintenance guy while it rained in my apartment seems unacceptable. The fact that I pay more rent now than I did when we had a manager and maintenance man on site makes it seems I should have at least the same level of dependability from the people who run this place.

He was posting on both about how depressed he was so I reached out to him and I have been able to keep steady contact for about a week now. &amp;#x200B; Our mother no longer has custody of him but she can have visitation if she pays an absurd amount of money. His father is quiet possibly the worst person on the planet, but that's a story for a different time. A few weeks ago my brother secretly messaged our mother and she said it came off as suicidal, so when I messaged him I tried to get as much information from him that he could give me. From what he has told me, he thinks about suicide every day, he normally doesn't eat or sleep and thinks there's nothing more to life, while this isn't the only thing that this whole thing involves, its the most pressing. He told me he doesn't want our mom to know and he doesn't want to have his dad find out. Our mother recently had a Dr. visit and she mentioned his messages to her, and the Dr. said that legally she has to report them. &amp;#x200B; Here's the dilemma, once my mom does report it, the state could potentially take my little brother, again and fail him, again. What I can't have is to have him handed off to his father's side of the family because they are all the same and they won't understand or won't care enough to do anything. As far as I know I am the only person from our siblings that could take him and I would want nothing more, but I am a full time student, almost finished, living with my father at the moment, until I get my degree. While I will work as hard as I can to get him, at this moment and for the next few months I feel like the state wouldn

text: My mother’s rights to her deceased husband’s house?. My mother and stepfather live in PA. Earlier this year, my stepfather passed away suddenly from a very aggressive form of cancer. My mom and stepfather were only married for about 7 years and in that time she was never added to the deed or mortgage of his house. Unfortunately the cancer so was quick moving once they got the diagnosis- they didn’t have time to add her to the deed, etc. before he passed a few short weeks later. This issue is what rights she has to this house. She is currently still paying the mortgage, but she will be moving in with me shortly, in a different state. This house is in disrepair, and is in an area with a very depressed housing market. Because this house is technically not “hers”, I want her to walk away from it. She is retired, has no income aside from social security and a small life insurance payout from my stepfather. She does not have the money to sink into a house that is probably worth 50k (or less) to get it in selling condition. Plus there’s still about 14k left on the mortgage. She wants to know if she sells the house, would it need to be through an estate - and would the proceeds from the sale be liquidated to pay off his personal debt and medical bills? Or would she be given the money, minus the difference of the remaining balance of the mortgage. I personally feel it’s not worth it to sell a house that she does not own if she would not benefit from it - and would possibly lose money in trying to make the house sellable. She is supposed to contact a local attorney to inquire about this, but has been dragging her feet for weeks because - well this is obviously a difficult time for her. Thanks for any insight.

text: Is it legal for a business to have no religious exceptions for men with beards?. Sorry if my flair is wrong but I believe this is under employment law. I work for a chain of convenience stores in New Jersey and they have stated that even if I’m a Muslim, I am not allowed to have a beard even though I work outside at a gas station. Basically, is this a legal practice for a business to have? If I have a beard for religious purposes how is it right for them to tell me it’s not allowed? Hypothetically, they are barring Sikhs from working anywhere in their stores as well since they cannot shave their beards in their religion. I know it’s not a huge life ending deal for me to shave, which I currently do, but it’s kind of shocking for upper management to flat out tell you there are zero religious exceptions for something so prominent in many religions.

I will leave out many details and attempt to give the overall big picture. I am currently renting a room in a 4 bed 2 bath house. My landlord lives in the master, there is a tenant in each of the other two rooms, and my girlfriend and I share a room. My landlord's mother moved in and has been living in our living room for the past 3 months. Since she moved in there have been numerous disturbances to the house. She has smoked cigarettes in the house numerous times (which my landlord handled after I brought this to his attention). The smell of smoke negatively affects my career as I am finishing up school and do my residency in the hospital setting. She brought two dogs with her that pee on EVERYTHING. She is an alcoholic and about once weekly slams doors or flips out in her room (the living room) waking everyone in the house up. She has not liked me nor my girlfriend since she moved in. She is mentally unstable due to the fact that I am unable to have a conversation with her. We have pretty much ignored eachothers presence until today. Today she stopped the washing machine with my girlfriends work uniform inside and threw the clothes on top of the machine. My girlfriend is responsible for these clothes and if they are damaged she has to pay $200 to her company for them. I confronted my landlords mother asking her VERY politely to not touch our clothes but just ask us when we are done so she can go ahead and use the machines. She immediately lost her cool and started screaming and became very verbally hostile. My landlord came home and mediated the situation in which I remained very calm and explain my issues factually while she continued to pace around the kitchen, yell, and take smoke breaks every ten minutes.

text: [Oklahoma] Do I have grounds to break my lease?. I recently moved into an apartment with my girlfriend, and to say it has been a less than stellar experience is putting it lightly. Right off the bat, AC and fridge don't work despite maintenance supposedly doing a check before we moved in. There are rat droppings in the cabinets, a few roaches here and there. Maintenance comes and replaces the fridge with an old unit from a different apartment, and says it will be replaced in 3 days. Well that took a month, and was by far the least of our concerns. It took the apartment complex 4 months to fix the AC and it was summertime in Oklahoma. Took them 2 months to order a new unit and even then it was still not working. It got so bad we had to stay somewhere other than our apartment for a while until they fixed the issue. Obviously, we asked for a concession. We had talkedwith them about not paying rent for June, which the manager said not to worry about, then got a meeting with the manager and got a concession for half off July's rent. A couple weeks later we get an email stating we were to be evicted due to unpaid rent in June, obviously we were blindsided by this and I emailed the PM right away, and he said that he made a mistake and he thought June was included with our original concession (500 off first months rent upon moving in) and therefore we would need to pay that month off in full. Not wanting to be evicted for fear of hurting my cosigners credit I agreed to set up a payment plan to get the rent paid off. Two weeks after this we become INFESTED with cockroaches. I'm talking almost covering the floor and if any dishes are left out they get covered.

Basically I worked inside the automotive manufacturer facility as a go between for both companies. I'm paid however by the plastics manufacturer. Over this time, I've obviously made friendships with people inside the automotive plant. One such person was a lady around her late 50's, possibly older. We always had banter back and forth. She would call me ""young and stupid"" (I'm in my mid 30's), and I'd call her ""old and dumb"". For years this happened. There was never an issue. We would always laugh, talk about families, etc. All of this changed one week ago today. It was later in the shift and everyone was ready for the weekend. As she walked by my desk, she yelled ""Hey stupid!"". I shot back with ""Man, you're old."". Immediately her entire demeanor changed. She started becoming hysterical and screaming ""Does that make you feel better?!?"". This has never happened before, and in thinking I had done something wrong, I apologized immediately. I was holding a water bottle as I had just overfilled it literally to the brim. I went to place my hand on her shoulder as I was apologizing, and a very small amount spilled onto her shoulder. As you can imagine, this only made it worse. Over the next 20 minutes, I apologized profusely because it was a mistake and not something I would do on purpose. After everything was settled, she accepted my apology and we went our separate ways. Fast forward to Monday. I walked into the plant immediately and tried to find her to continue to apologize for Friday night. I found out that she was in Human Resources. After awhile, I'm called to their office and found out she had filed a harassment claim against me. She had claimed that I was bullying her. That she feared for her life around me.

Am I allowed to create an application and distribute it as closed source, as long as I don't modify the source of the GPL library? Or do I have to distribute the source of my application as soon as I use a GPL library? The library in question is [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and one of the libraries it depends on is [edtaa3](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/tree/master/3rdparty/edtaa3). As a related question, what would happen if I were to use a library that is legally breaking some of these licenses? I'm asking because I think the author of the bgfx library forgot to include some of the licenses of the libraries they used. Would I be in danger too? Thank you!

text: If I call Elderly Protective Services, what happens to my grandma?. Hi, I’m a 20y/o female living in Toronto, Ontario. My grandmother is 80, and living with my 40 year old aunt and my father in an apartment. She moved from her house 6 years ago and moved into this apartment 3 years ago. Obviously a house full of possessions moved with her as well. Before I was working, I was coming over frequently to help her sort through her items, and found myself also cleaning her apartment and cleaning for my aunt as well. My father is rarely there, especially as he now has a serious girlfriend. My grandmother can barely walk, she has breathing problems and sight/hearing issues. She can’t clean the place. My aunt leaves food to rot, piles of dirty clothes that are attracting bed bugs, doesn’t clean the cat litter, and feeds/bathes my grandma the bare minimum. She doesn’t work. She just lays on the couch or her bed, drinks, games and goes on facebook. She frequently spend her whole ODB cheque on makeup or toys (children’s toys) as well as part of my grandmother. Oh and alcohol. She constantly drinks. My aunt has Borderline Personality Disorder, so whole I have compassion for her I can’t let my grandmother live in filth because my aunt won’t get help. I want to call someone to help but I don’t want my grandma to go live in an assisted care home. If this is the wrong place for this I’m sorry I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m moving in a few months and I will live too far to come help.

text: Medical Marijuana and Me.... I am using a throw-away for obvious reasons... I am a public school teacher in a state that just legalized medical marijuana. I voted for it in hopes that federalism will eventually rule the rule day. My husband is a truck driver, often crossing state lines particularly into states not allowing any use of marijuana. He now wants to grow (newly permissible in our state) a few marijuana plants. He does not, however, want to obtain a prescription for the marijuana because he would no longer be able to purchase firearms. I told him no. I am terrified of losing my job or him losing his job should be caught. What is the legal issue here? My school board has a policy against drug use and he could be randomly drug tested by the DOT. Please help.

text: How long can I live in my apartment lobby and what would I be allowed to do there?. My building has an area after you enter the front entrance where the mailboxes are and leads to the stairs up to the apartment floors. There's a comfy couch in the lobby and there's enough room for me to not be in the way of anyone. My question is are there any laws that prohibit me to just hang out there for long periods at a time. And how far could I push this. Setup a monitor and bring my PlayStation and play games xD Take naps? Bring my own big comfy chair and leave it there? This lobby is probably 3x the size of my studio My apartment in SF is a studio and is very small so sometimes its just nice to have a change of scenery

The warrant was for living out of county I assume it’s a probation violation but don’t know what they were on probation for. I was wondering if there is anything I can do to get them out. They told me they would be in jail for 61 days but for such a minor offense I assume there has to be bail bond. I have called the facility they are at and they said they can’t release any information for a 72 hour period for whatever reason. Is there anything I can do to avoid as much jail time for them as possible?

text: Am I screwed here?. A couple weeks ago my daughter had a sleep over with a few of her 17/18 year old friends. They came over and hung out, watched movies, went in the hot tub, etc. Normally I let my daughter have a beer or two when she’s home with us hanging out. Well during the sleep over my daughter and couple of her friends ended up having a few drinks. Flash forward to the next day I wake up to sexts from one of my daughters friend claiming we hooked up the night before. She’s 17 and I’m 38. My wife had gone to bed pretty early and I don’t remember much after midnight. I DOUBT I had sex with this girl. I’ve been ignoring her texts and blocked her since Saturday but she’s continuing to escalate. Today she messaged me on Facebook saying she going to go to the police to “get me back” for taking advantage of her. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t want to go to the police because I let the kids drink. Do I have any protection here? Could the still get my DNA if we did hook up? Am I looking at big trouble for letting them drink? Should I just ignore her until she stops? I do have a vasectomy so there’s not chance of pregnancy. What should I do here? I’m in OR if that matters.

text: [KS] One of my peers threatened to physically harm me, but, I somewhat instigated the situation. Pleqse help me figure out where I fall in sight of the law.. Around 2 hours ago, I was talking with some buddies of mine in our football group chat. After talking for a while, we got onto the topic of girls, as high school students do. One of my ""buddies"" (I don't consider him to be my friend) started going off on me out of the blue. He called me a man-ho, and said that I flirt with a lot of girls. I said ""there's nothing wrong with playing the field."" After a little while longer, I had gotten fed up and decided to shut the kid up. I said ""I don't know why you're getting onto me about being a ho, I can make a long list of people your mom slept with in high school."" I know this to be true because of my father. After that remark, he threatened to beat the shit out of me, to which I said, ""go ahead, I'll take every punch you got"" knowing that if that were to happen, I could sue him for potentially everything he has. Except, I don't know if that's true, seeing as though I'm unsure if the Cyber bullying laws in my country. Please keep in mind that I did NOT use any derogatory terms when talking to the guy, I never once used the word, ho, whore, or anything related to describe him or his mother. I'm simply wondering about the Cyber bullying laws in my state, and was wondering if I could have any backlash from what I said, from a legal standpoint Thanks!

text: Real-estate agent claims he did not receive my rent, demands to be repaid. Denver, CO. So i just moved into a new place in Denver, i moved in Sept. 28th. I was busy the day of the official move in so i had to have my roommate take my rent money order to the real-estate office. She is new to renting and didn't get a receipt, she gave her half of the rent, my have of the rent and our pet deposit to our landlord personally, he told her he had everything he needed and she went on her way. The lease stipulated that the first months rent was due at the time of move in, so i feel that they tacitly accepted our rent. But i got an email saying that they hadn't gotten the rent yesterday on Oct. 12th... Now the agent is basically saying it's down to my word vs. his, i cant find the receipt for the money order anywhere but im planning on going to the grocery store where i got it to see if they can help me find some record of it. I make next to nothing and this situation is threatening to destroy my life. Your advice would be extremely helpful, thank you.

What recourse do I have?. I had unprotected sex in Durham county while an undergrad at Duke with a local.We broke up and then she told me she was pregnant. I moved to NYC after I graduated and before child was born. She married about a year after child was born. I have been paying a contractually agreed upon sum of $1000/month since. I see my son twice a year in NC. I found out through the register of deeds office this week that a new birth certificate was filed in 2008 due to an adoption. (To my knoledge she never listed me as father on original.) We did do a DNA test in 2007 which confirmed paternity. Shouldn't I have had some notice that an adoption was occurrring to allow me to contest? Should I be entitled to the monies paid for 10 years? $120k. How should I notify her that I do not intend to pay anymore?

text: Alimony Question. I live in Southern California first off. This may or may not be a simple yes/no but my current boyfriend's (of five years to give you an idea of the time frame) baby mom is saying she is going to sue him for alimony. He filed for divorce a little over a year into the marriage and they separated before then. She was also unfaithful during the time they were together (the reason for the separation). At the time, he was only receiving SSI income. The divorce still isn't final because someone won't sign the papers, so I'm wondering if this will have any bearing on the fact that they're still technically ""married"". My question is, CAN she really go after him for alimony, and if she does, does the length of the time of marriage still count all these years without signed divorce papers? And if she does go after him, I was reading about ""post marital"" income which doesn't count after the fact. Since he was only on SSI he's not eligible for alimony... I think. I'm not sure where to go for this and worse case scenario we need to hire a lawyer we will but I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice or guidance. Thanks in advance.

text: (GER) Does police target me, just because i handle large sums?. I was with a partner at a bank in Germany the other day. We were gonna sign a business deal, involving a large sum of money. There were several months of planing, signing, notaries and lawyers involved - all located in germany. So we were sitting at the table with some bankers, when suddenly 3 police investigators joined us. I stayed calm, but my partner from a foreign country kind of escalated the situation by threatening to sue them and loosing it. They took us to the police station, and questioned us throughout the day. In the evening they let us go, because we did nothing wrong. My partner is furious and will contact his embassy and sue everyone. The deal and months of work are probably ruined. The thing that i do not understand: Everything we do is legal and well-documented. Why did the german police not just ask for the documents before TAKING US IN? Is this not usually the last step? Any german Redditors involved with police, law and/or government, please enlighten me. Edit:typos

text: Can my landlord tow my car?. This is in Portland, Oregon. My apartment complex has a parking lot. There's no assigned parking, but my lease specifically says I'm allowed to park a vehicle in the lot. Parking isn't always easy in the city so this was a major perk of moving here. My apartment complex recently switched management companies. The new management recently sent a letter informing tenants that too many people were leaving inoperable cars in the lot, and therefore cars must move once every three days or be towed. I try to avoid using my car when I can help it, so I often do not move it for long stretches. No one has given me trouble yet, but does management have the right to tow our cars when the lease promises parking?

text: Guy steals my backpack at library, local PD say no way to prove it’s my property.. Yesterday I was at the library, where I left my backpack full of personal belongings (laptop, wallet, textbooks) sitting on a table while I went to the restroom. I come back, and a guy about the same height as me is carrying it slung over one shoulder, hastily walking away. I did a sort of “hey! Stop!” to the guy and basically we ended up both being confronted by a police officer at the main entrance of the library. The guy says I’m harassing him, I say that he is trying to take my bag with my belongings in it. Here’s where it gets juicy: the cop who stopped me says “if you can prove it’s yours, it’s yours. I cannot charge a man with theft based on a he said this, he said that situation.” I get pretty pissed upset at this because I tell the police officer that my wallet, full of cards that I list off, is in my backpack and I could login to the laptop in the bag. The guy taking my bag says he does not have to prove what is in “his bag.” And tries to walk away again. The police officer tells me that he is correct, and let’s the guy walk away. I then filed a formal statement about the guy literally stealing my bag and the police officer tells me that “the library is not responsible for stolen goods.” Not once did I mention it being the library’s fault, I was trying to say that my bag is stolen. I filed a police report this morning but essentially a police officer let a criminal get away with theft. What do I do? What did the officer do wrong?

I have never used this service before and I’ve already contacted the company. However, the issue is as followed: they’ve completely started to ignore my emails. On October 15th, I sent out my first email. Doordash customer support said that they’d get back to me within a maximum of 2 days. As of today, it’s been almost 10 days yet no message back. I’ve emailed them repetitively too get ANY updated but they’ve yet to respond to a single one!

text: My Uncle passed away and verbally left a condo to me. My Auntie has the condo and refused to sign it to me or even speak to me. Is there anything I can do?. Important info: The condo is in Hawaii, my mother and I live in Jersey. ** My Uncle (mothers brother who was never married and no kids) passed away in 2016. I was underage at the time and my mom and my uncle never got along. He verbally told several people (all of them willing to do anything they need to help me) and myself that he was leaving the apartment to my Auntie Susan (not blood related) but when I turned of age she would sign it over to me. At first my Auntie agreed to sign over the condo to my mom right after his death. She postponed it so long that my mom eventually had to fly back home before getting it signed to her (the condo is in Hawaii where we grew up, but we now live in Jersey so it’s hard to get there to coordinate things). My Auntie also told a lot of people that she was going to give it to me like my uncle asked her too. I have been of age for two years now but she was invading my calls and kept telling me she was working on it. I have fallen on hard times and would really like to live there. She is now 100% ignore all my calls and texts. Is there anything I can do to fight her on this? My uncle paid for this condo with the money my grandmother left him when she passed. My Auntie hasn’t put any money into it or towards it (maybe condo fees but they could just be unpaid I’m not sure) and as far as I know she is leaving a homeless drug user live there. TL;DR My uncle passed away and left a condo in my aunts name. He verbally told maybe people that it was meant for me, she also told many many people. These people are willing to help me in anyway possible. My Auntie is ignoring all my texts and calls.

My landlord owes me over $800, he took expenses (which he will not produce a receipt for) and sent me a check for much less. He is withholding the rest, but I’m curious if cashing what he’s sent me would essentially be me consenting to this amount. The landlord (of course) disagrees and has blocked my number. My lawyer says I have to take him to small claims court, and I maybe could even lose although I have the proof that’s he’s not supplied a receipt. I’d love to cash to this partially supplied check of my owed deposit, but I’m worried cashing it will be my consent to him legally keeping the rest of my money. I’m in Illinois btw.

In 2017, i was invited to join a special summer program at the college I was going to be a freshman at come Fall and I very happily took it. A few days in, I was told that I needed to move into a new dorm because I had a cat and my roommate had just found out that she's allergic to cats. I was given basically overnight to move my stuff. I asked one of my classmates to help me move and he agreed. That night, after things were moved, he got the wrong idea and sexually assaulted me. I said no, I screamed, but nobody could hear me. He left me with bruises all over my chest and really bad PTSD. There was no security on that floor, the resident assistant wasnt set to move in until the following week, and no other student was housed on this floor. He was arrested and booked. The clothes I was wearing at the time, the sheets it happened on, everything was confiscated by police. I was told I would get a chance to testify in court. A couple of months rolled around, I couldnt focus in my studies, and in October, the VA pulled funding (Im daughter to a vet). They had accidentally given me too much and pulled the money. I was left with $11000 in debt. At this point, I gave up, left college, and went to go work full time. I never heard anything more about my case. There was no court date communicated to me, I never got to testify. It wasnt until I pursued damages towards the school with a local lawyer in mid 2018 that I found out that all charges had been dropped against him, he got off on bail, got his bail money back, and that was that. It smelled really fishy. I want to know if there's any more legal action I can take at this point, against the boy or the school (for not providing adequate protection). The lawyer I talked to last year told me he didnt think its wise to pursue

text: Is there a minimally painful way to go after my horrible former landlady for money owed?. I live in Seattle, moved here at the end of August and had a room lined up to rent when I arrived. We had a month-to-month, mostly verbal agreement. I gave her $100 via Venmo to hold the room for me and a money order for 1st+last when I arrived. Two weeks later she verbally attacked me and cussed me out over an extremely minor issue, at which point I realized she's actually a narcissist and all around awful person. Two weeks after THAT (Sep 28th), she left me a 4-page, handwritten note detailing all the unacceptable things I had done and giving me 20 days notice. I was gone by October 4th. By the 20th she was already kicking out the other guy who had just moved in right before I left, and I later found a complaint made to the city about 2 other evictions she had made this summer. At the time I was handling a new job, living on my own for the first time and had no energy whatsoever to confront this extremely unpleasant person over $600. Now that I'm in a stable position I'm wondering -- what reasonable action could I take in this situation? I'd like to get some money back, and I'd also like to somehow report her highly unethical renting practices to the city and the actual owner of the house (who I never met). Her ads on Craigslist are also very much a misrepresentation of the truth. Obviously there's more to the story but I don't want to clutter up this post with too many details. Thank you so much for any input!!

Tennessee law Today 4 of us was told we would be starting an On call work schedule. Each of us are going to rotate a week in which we must answer calls from customers if they are “down stores” and provide tech support and dispatch a tech if we can’t fix them over the phone. The hours are 5-8pm Monday - Friday and 8-8 Saturday and Sunday with an on call pay of $100 a week. We have a answering service who will be learning how to filter down stores from non urgent calls. Where I feel we are getting cheated is they won’t be paying us hourly for the time we are actually on the phone. If we don’t have a call then we are free to do as we please and I know they are doing that correctly but once we have a call we must return the customer call and resolve it. We are in Tennessee.

We split physical custody 50/50 with time on a alternating week schedule. I have been paying $800 a month child support for 2 kids for over 3 years now. That amount was agreed on between my ex and I after our lawyers calculated the amount using the state's formula, DHR is not involved. The amount was calculated when daycare and medical cost were involved for both kids. She has since taken them off her insurance through work and put the kids on Medicaid and is not paying for any daycare. My question is can I petition the court to lower child support because she won't agree to a lower payment and what are my chances of a ruling in my favor? I wasn't sure if it's enough of an argument to say I have the kids 50% of the time, I'm also paying rent, utilities, gas, groceries, clothing, etc. when they are with me and all of that is outside of child support and also that since medical and daycare cost are no longer an expense. I've offered to put them on my medical insurance at work but she won't agree to do so.

text: Should I pursue payment in lieu of notice after being fired on the spot?. Not sure where to ask for advice but I guess this is a good start. I’m based in the UK. I have been an assistant manager at my (previous) place of work since November. I signed a contract stating some conditions of termination; these conditions were that if I wished to terminate the contract then I must give one months notice, if the company wished to terminate the contract then I will receive one month’s wages (note that it wasn’t stated that they must give one months notice). My contract was terminated on the spot (via text message) after missing a meeting. There is some confusion around the meeting in that I say that I verbally mentioned I wouldn’t make it and they say I didn’t. In a follow up meeting, the company has stated that my contract was terminated after multiple breaches of contract (not following job description, lack of timekeeping, phone use at work). The contract states that, for breaches of contract, the first warning is a verbal one, the second a written one, and the third is cause for possible termination. I have received ‘some’ verbal warnings, however no written ones. In this meeting, the company brought their copy of the contract wherein they had removed said paragraph regarding termination. After showing them my copy, I was offered one week’s wages to drop this matter ‘as an act of goodwill’ (their words). Within the document, I have only signed and dated the front page, which states that conditions of termination are in a following document. The following document was not signed. I should add that I am close friends with the director of this company, and have been long since before I started working there. I would like to know how to go about this whilst burning as few bridges as possible. I think I’ve included all the information I can, am I entitled to more than one week’s wages or should I just suck it up, accept the offer, and learn from it? Thanks in advance

text: Summer job still owes me money, hasn't responded to any communication...what do I do now? (X-Post from Personal Finance). Hi Legal Advice, This summer I started my first job (I am 15) at a summer camp in NJ. I was told (and signed a contract) I would be paid semiannually $650 in 3 payments. During that camp, I was also chosen to help out by being a ""bus monitor,"" which I was told would get me another $100. This whole ""bus monitor"" thing seemed pretty informal -- it consisted of my boss walking up to me and going like ""hey you want to help me be bus monitor and you get $100 added to your pay"" and me being like ""yea sure."" I've only been paid $600 of that, and no one has responded to multiple emails or phone calls. Apparently I'm not the only one too...several of my friends are in similar situations with this camp, but many of them have just told me to ""forget about it"". What is my next step here? Is it even worth going after that least $150? I feel like there's a really obvious answer here, but honestly all of this is so confusing to me. Thanks for any advice

text: Are there limitations to how long a written notice is valid?. My landlord left a message on the 6th of February saying there would be sanitation inspections on the 28th of February. The notice stated that any issues would have 7 days to be corrected or else a $75 and possible eviction could occur. We cleaned up the apartment, but come the 28th... nothing. No sign they had inspected. No notice. Nothing. We just moved on. In March, we started going through our things and donating lots of stuff we don't need anymore. Because of this, a lot is in bins and looks quite messy. Today, March 28th, we got a notice that, including some troubling stuff about our pets (they claimed we haven't paid a deposit, when we have for both cats), they also did a sanitation inspection today without sending another notice. They also didn't list any specific issues or grievances to correct.

text: Michigan termination of employment - manager chooses when to enforce policy to prevent termination for some yet I was terminated.. Corporation operates on a very strict points system policy. Points given for any missed/late punch, calling in sick to work, not having badge, etc. Termination occurs at x points per company policy.My boss would occasionally enter in a time for me if I forgot to punch or when she told me I didn't punch but I was sure that I did.In previous conversations I was told that even if I reached x points, there would be something like a life circumstances review and it didn't automatically mean termination. I was told I am an extremely valuable employee and would not just be terminated.On a Monday I got to work on time, realized I didn't have my badge, took a picture of the time clock to prove I was on time and discovered my badge had fallen out of my purse in my boyfriend's car. I was penalized for not punching in and for not having my badge which is a dress code violation. My badge was dropped off to me before the first half of my shift ended. Manager tells me I now have x points and she has to submit this to HR. On Wednesday I asked my manager if I need to be looking for a new job and she said she doesn't think so. I was not involved in any circumstances review or anything.Thursday she pulls a coworker aside and tells her that my employment is up for review and to try to learn some things from me.

text: Purchasing house, has basement apartment with tenant who doesn't seem interested in leaving. Location: North Carolina My wife and I will be closing on a house at the end of the month. The house has an apartment that we will be reincorporating back into the main house. There is a tenant in the apartment, the current owner gave the tenant verbal notice in August to be out by the end of October (they are on a month-month agreement, likely verbal) but no progress. The owner gave written notice last week that they had to be out in 30 days. We are nervous that this tenant could pose a problem for us after closing. We do not want to walk away from the deal, as this house is in a very desirable location and meets all of our very specific wants/needs. Is there anything we can be doing now to prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario (tenant refuses to move out?)? Although we have been landlords in the past, this is a new one for us and don't know what we could potentially be dealing with. Thank you.

text: Company Ethics Code states that it can be changed at any time without notification to, or agreement of, the associate (employee). I work at a tech company that is fully owned by a major US corporation. My company sent out an Ethics Agreement for employees to sign, and at the end of the document, it states &gt; This Ethics Code does not create a contract between the Company and any Associate, Officer or Director and no promise of any kind is made by the Company in this Ethics Code. **The Company is free to change the terms of this Ethics Code without having to consult with or obtain the agreement of any Associate.** Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and an Associate, each of the Company and our Associates continue to have the authority to terminate the employment relationship at will, and the Company has the authority to change the terms of an Associate’s employment, in each case with or without cause and with or without prior notice. This at-will status can only be modified if such modification is in writing and signed by both the Associate and an authorized officer of the Company. Claiming they can change the agreement that I am bound by, without letting me know, seems ridiculous. Is this an unusual clause in an agreement between employer and employee? I am heavily inclined to refuse to sign it.

text: [US] A question of online gambling. (United States) Say we have a stream on twitch.tv (thus, international) that offers various gambling games (using fake money of course), but we introduce a paid currency to do things other than participate in the game itself (to change the secondary color of your name, etc.). Tokens can also be randomly earned (very rare) chance during a specific event on our stream, one at a time, to one random participator. This paid currency has an exchange rate of $1 USD = 1 token, and there is **no way** to exchange the tokens back into USD, and there never will be. Now, I understand there are plenty of laws regarding actual money gambling, but I believed before that those laws only regarded **actual money itself** being bet on something, or substitute currency that can be exchanged back, which ours cannot be. Are there any legal problems with the gambling of the exchange currency (tokens)? If so, which laws?

text: Do I have to mention my once-in-a-lifetime sidejob?. I work at a media company which produces movies, series, etc. My contract includes the phrase, that I have to tell them about ANY side jobs I plan to do and that they might even forbid it, if the said side job would mean I work for a competitor. Just a few weeks ago a friend in the same business but different company (so a competitor) asked me if I'd be interested in being an extra in an episode of his company's TV series. I just said yes, not thinking about my actual job or what phrases my contract includes (I mean, it's been a few years since I signed it and I haven't re-read it ever since). But recently I started thinking about whether it might affect my actual job and read my contract. I started thinking about my boss watching TV in a few months and seeing me sitting there on that bench in that one episode. Is this me appearing in the episode actually working FOR the competitor? I mean, the success of this episode or even the entire series does not depend on me sitting there. Any other person could've sat there. Also, in my company I'm part of the sales team and it's not like I tried to help the other company with their sales strategy or whatever. On the other hand I did have a contract for that day and got around 50 bucks. Going further: Let's say my boss/my company/whoever finds out AND they are not happy about it – could something like this be the reason to get fired without notice or is this more or less a thing of ""well, just don't do it again and we're fine""?

They currently split time with kids at about 50/50. The father is verbally abusive, slapped one kid across the face and told the kid not to tell anyone or they would get in more trouble, has marijuana at his home, has no food (only candy) at his home, and various other bad things. These reports of bad things I’ve heard come straight from the kids’ mouths. The plan is to go to court and try and get full custody, but my friend is currently saving to get a lawyer. I’ve read not allowing visits during separation can hurt the chances of getting custody in court. Is there a way to get full custody NOW without hurting her chances of full custody down the line? Should we call the police? CPS? Also are there any legal aid societies that could help? Thanks!

text: I just got served with a notice from the HOA to pay my dues in full for the condo I'm renting from or they will begin the process to evict me. Problem is, I DID pay my rent to my landlord.. For the past 3 years I have been renting from my landlord (a property manager) and paid my rent in full, on time every month. For the past couple week we have been getting letters from an attorneys office addressed to someone who does do not live in my condo (it's just me and my boyfriend on the lease). So we have sent them back because we figured it was meant for someone who lived there before us. On Saturday we got one addressed to ""Unknown Tenant"" so we opened it. It was a letter from an attorney demanding us to pay our fees in full (amount was not disclosed) immediately to the HOA (attorney worked for the HOA). I called my landlord and let them know what was going on, they said they would call the owner. I sent pictures of the letter and the orange slip from the post labeled ""FINAL"". Fast forward to today when a legal server came to my door to deliver a 3-day notice legal letter to pay all dues up front to the HOA immediately (amount still not disclosed). My name was not on the letter, in fact the guy asked my name and then wrote it on the letter. He said if we did not pay within 3 days they would begin with eviction proceedings. I let him know I do not own the condo. He said he was just a contractor and just had to serve the letter. I called my landlord right afterwards and they said they would immediately call the owner. Apparently the owner pays the rent for the year in one payment (to the HOA) and might have forgotten? I'm not sure for we were just speculating. My landlord suggested we get proof of payment for the rent we paid for October in case. He didn't say in case of what, but I assume it is in case of eviction. My questions to the community are: Will the eviction go on my record even though I paid my rent always and on time?

My GF has been working at a store for almost 2 years now and has seen co-workers come and go. Her SM is related to the ""area"" (2 stores) manager. The AM employs her own daughter at the other store and now her GD works at the other store with my GF. GF was told when she started there that holidays were a 3-way split between the employees, yet the GD has somehow had the last 2 holidays off. Last night the GD came in, spent 30 minutes in the bathroom and then left sick. GF called the SM and let her know, SM said she'd have to stay because last night she was shopping around for a storage unit for her mother and her son had a ball game. Her suggestion was to switch Saturday with GD. That, however, would actually give GD more hours than GF. I just found out that the SM is only paying her 14.5 hours for yesterday because the GD was there for.5 hour (in the bathroom). This is not unusual behavior, GD has called off several times in the past and GF gets hosed routinely. GD is never reprimanded or punished for this behavior and I'm trying to keep my cool and not call the main store and start ripping people a new one. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.

text: Need help dealing with my family and my business.. I'm not sure where to begin. I need advice on how to proceed involving my father, who is in prison, and the business I now own, but he is one of the 2 co founders of the business. Also involved in this mess is my younger sister, who lives with me because of my father and stepmother. So I'll start with the business. About 12 years ago, my father started a business with another guy, we can call him James. About 5ish years ago, my father sold his half of the business to Jeff so that his wife, my stepmother, could not get access to it if/when they divorce. My father and stepmother got heavily into meth, which led to my stepmother abusing my sister, while my father did little to nothing to stop it. My sister moved in with me about 3 years ago. So back in April of this year, James was getting to the point of refusing to deal with my father. At this point my father was heavily involved with meth, and had been on the run from the police for about a year and a half. Also at this point I was basically doing my dads job within the business. The business is a tree service, James did all the estimates, and my dad (which eventually was just me when he was heavy into the drugs) was supposed to lead the crews on the actual job site and oversee everything that actually happens. So James wanted out. He gave me the option of taking over the business as the 100% sole owner, all I would have to pay is the taxes so Jeff could transfer everything into my name. I initially said no, but I foolishly let me father talk me into changing my mind. Within a few days, my father got arrested for driving, got a bunch of charges, including driving without a license, possession, and evading capture from when he was on the run. So I was left with this business I didnt want, and I only accepted because convinced me he would be right there and help. This business has been failing for years. Ever since he has been in jail, he has been constantly calling, or getting my stepmother

He keeps saying he is an attention whore and needs to be ignored but due to me having depression myself know exactly what he is doing, crying for help.

His mother, brother, and one of his mothers weed friends all are emotionally abusing him for his sexuality and on multiple occasions his brother has tried to kill him. He has tried to get help from the school counselor but apparently that only made things worse. He is too scared to call the police without evidence because he knows if he does the abuse will get physical. Apparently almost like clockwork his mother and stepfather argue and he might be able to record it. I don't know what state he lives in and I don't know what to do. I have had a friend screenshot the events and we are doing our best to help him. I'm mostly asking how he can get evidence and get to the police safely.

So this is something I been wondering about for years now. Like for example If someone took an image of MIssingno, (A glitch pokemon from the first pokemon games that was not intended by the creators and Nintendo doesn't acknowledge) and put that image on like a shirt or put the exact image of that glitch pokemon int their game, would they be breaking Nintendo and game freaks copyright over the pokemon series even though they don't acknowledge that glitch as being part of the series? Or if game or software internally puts the same glitch from another game into their game down to the same way of activating the glitch as a reference or easter egg? Mostly asking this out of curiosity more so than immediate legal need. I see people reference missingno and the Y2K a lot in pop culture and have had that question in the back of my head.

text: Moving out early. I was presented with an opportunity to take over someone’s lease at an apartment much closer to work (2 mile instead of my current 28 mile commute). It was super last minute but I took them up on it. I informed my landlord on 4/16 that I am moving out and I plan on moving on 4/28. He said that was okay. He then texted me a couple hours later saying the notice was too soon and that I had two options: help him find someone to take it over, or stay until 5/16 and pay half the months rent for May. This will not work for me financially because I already have to pay the first months rent for the new lease plus a possible security deposit (I say possible because the landlord might work something out with me since it was so last minute). I am totally fine with helping him find someone for as long as he needs but I don’t think I can stay there another month and pay because of the way my bills have been set up to get this move going. It’s very early so I might still have time to figure something out but my landlord has been known to suddenly change his mind on previous agreed upon arrangements. Which is one of the reasons why I waited so long to give him notice because I was afraid he would turn around and try to evict me immediately or make the remainder of my stay a living hell until I leave. The place I currently live at is a room that I’m renting in the landlords house. Two other roommates along with the landlord himself also live in the house. It was a very unofficial agreement to rent out the room. I don’t think I even actually signed a rental agreement, just a lease application in order for him to have some information on me. I was ready to get out of this house due to numerous problems that I have with the landlord and the rental. I work overnight so I am home during the day, that being said he refused to let me use the heater during the winter and now refuses to let me use the ac when it’s getting hot. On top of that, the ceiling fan in my room is broken and I mentioned it to him multiple times yet he still hasn’t fixed

text: Landlord threatening to call lawyer to enter unit for silly reason with 48hrs notice. Landlord is proving himself to be an aggressive male, easily affronted. Just moved in to our unit. There were some issues with him prior to signing the lease where he tried to reneg verbal agreements multiple times which was a red flag. I emailed him thanking him for welcoming my bf and I into his home blah blah blah but could he he please advise regarding the washer smelling moldy and having thick brown liquid leaking from the front lip. He became very heated and agreed to have a professional take care of it after becoming defensive and angry in person. Then he called back and said he would clean it himself and I wasn’t qualified to say it smelled moldy. He then escalated and said he would come by in 48hrs if I didn’t allow him to come by tonight. I told him since neither he or I could agree whether it was mold, I gave him a one hour window for a professional to show up tonight. He threatened legal action claiming I “couldn’t stop him from entering his home if he gave 48hrs notice” I told him I had no problem with him coming by, but I’d prefer if a professional checked it out as well and offered to pay for it myself/ He didn’t show up. He has a huge ego, he’s very condescending and rude. I don’t care too much about the washer And I can figure it myself given his dramatic reaction. Someone please clarify, though, whether a landlord can come over any time they feel with a 48hr heads up. I want as little to do with him as possible. Since moving in we’ve found he’s lied about the noise pollution level, agreement to patch holes in walls, and other neighbors have complained about how rude and “yelly” he was... as in this grown man regularly “yelled” at his adult neighbors. TLDR if I inadvertently pissed off my landlord, can

text: [OH] landlord refusing to refund security and itemized deductions for repairs needed. So long story short I recently moved out of my apartment about 6 weeks ago and still have yet to receive any itemized deductions from the property manager and has since stopped responding to my text messages. I haven given them my email to send the list to but they have always tried to avoid the conversation and bring something else up. I had also been hearing from other tenants that they didn’t do any cleaning and they had to when they had moved in and found cat litter on the floor and other small damages that they assumed would be done by the time they had moved in. Correct me if I am wrong but I believe Ohio law is that it need to be refunded after deductions within 30 days or else I can sue for triple damages but I would prefer not to and just be done with the whole issue Please let me know if any additional is needed as well, thanks

text: Minor parking ticket today, city ordinance seems unclear, seeking advice as a young adult. "" It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle on any public street within an area extending twenty-five feet from a street intersection, unless designated by yellow colored paint. ***(Ord. 3942, 1)*** "" &amp;#x200B; So the city seems to have very clearly recently redone this particular curb in the last 3 months or so. This street parking space is in the area just beyond the marked yellow for the cross walk and intersection. There aren't any no parking signs or any indication that the area was not to be occupied, I had only the yellow paint to go off of. I had more than enough room for my vehicle, to where I'm a conservative 3 feet within the unpainted section, so I thought I was golden. Obviously I'm surprised when I get back later that day to see a ticket under my wiper. The ticket is pretty clear and all, states the above ordinance and admittedly I am clearly within 25 feet from the intersection, by my measurement about 21 feet. What really got me all flustered was that they bothered to repaint the curb yellow after redoing it, but they did not extend it back the 25 feet like it *used* to be before the curb was redone. (google maps image proves it). I was then motivated to go home and look it up..... &amp;#x200B; Here's the legal advice I'm seeking as a young adult: 1.) "".. unless designated by yellow colored paint."" To me that sounds like the city intentionally did not paint this section of curb after the reconstruction of the curb to allow for parking, especially when there is past proof that the curb was not painted. Is this enough get this whole thing thrown out? 2.) As far as minor parking tickets like this go, do many small towns or municipalities in general let it slide if bring the fine collector a small, 30 second, well-founded case? 3.) Is a minor parking fine even worth fighting? Honestly everything in my body says this isn't right

text: Civil Union vs Marriage vs Domestic Partnership (CO, heterosexual couple). Hello - my girlfriend and I have been together for nearly eight years (with no children), however we're both hesitant to get 'hitched' (both very independent, would prefer to avoid any legal 'headaches' if things for some reason change, and we can't even come close to affording a wedding ceremony at this point - nor would we like the attention). A side consideration is that I will be pursuing a 4 year graduate program, and including her income may adversely (possibly drastically) affect the amount of federal financial aid I would receive (this may make our whole question null). Recently, she changed positions, and her new position does not offer affordable health insurance. I work at a hospital and have a very affordable plan (the motive for this question). I was told CO is a common-law state, and my employer requires at minimum an affidavit of common law marriage to share health benefits. So this led us to a Civil Union, which seemed to meet all of our needs. We went to the county clerk, who asked us why we would prefer to get a civil union over a marriage, and led us to believe (in addition to being a bit rude) a few things opposite of what we'd found when researching previously: * There are no significant differences between a marriage and civil union, except marriage is recognized federally * The reason CU exists is for same-sex couples, and the recent law change just hasn't been reacted to yet * We would be required (non-optional) to file taxes jointly * We would be required to file for divorce if the relationship were to end (understood) and it would be essentially the exact same thing if we were married (not what we understood) We were essentially under the impression that a CU imparts some benefits (inheritance, hospital visitation, seemingly some power of attorney) in addition to the ability to cover her under my health insurance plan, and it therefore sounded like a good idea (CU sounded easier to dissolve,

text: Landlord is acting strange with giving us our security deposit back.... Just finished renting a home here in Texas. Lease ended on October 1st. Left the home in immaculate condition and even submitted early notice of departure with landlord on September 23rd. Landlord inspected home and texted us back that everything checked out and we’ll be receiving our check in the mail. Two weeks went by and we still haven’t received our check. Contacted landlord and he claimed check was mailed out on September 25th. It was a cashiers check. We confirmed he did mail it out on the 25th in which he texted us a pic of the check. Just found out today that since the check was lost in the mail and he has to send another check it’s costing him $60. He’s wanting us to go half on the cost with him. It obviously wasn’t our fault that the check was lost. How can we get around this? Thanks for all advice!

He hasn't done any of those things and I am due to move out of the house October 31st. The tax debt is affecting me in such a way that the minute I buy a house it will become a lien, and any real property that I own will be taken. Including the tax refund they have already been taken. I had a land contract all set and the deal fell through just days before getting the keys and now I have no other place lined up. My plan was get settled in my new place and then enforce the judgment so this lien would not affect any property ownership credit reports or background checks for employment going forward. He is not being very empathetic and is giving me a whole extra 2 weeks to move 18 years of my life and our son out of this house because ee is finding it hard to date while he lives at his mothers house and she won't let him decorate his 10 by 10 room. He's not a fan of it yellow color. Yes he really said these things. Obviously he has restricted my ability to move along on my own accord and is being very difficult. I am looking to file a stay of some kind while I proceed on the enforcement and show cause. **I'd love some pro tips....** Also, he was supposed to have 50/50 parenting time but has only taken 14% of overnights for the past 2 years.

Since then, at 7:15 every morning, M-Sat, I have been woken up by the sound of construction. They decided to remodel the apartment directly next to mine and have been using some kind of power tool that sounds like a jack hammer, blasting music, and overall just being really loud. This goes on all throughout the work day and I can get no peace. It’s so loud that even ear plugs don’t work because the walls are so thin in the building I can literally feel the vibration of whatever power tool is being used. This is so frustrating because I’m a student and hardly get enough sleep as is. I would be fine if it was only M-F but Saturday too? I am going crazy here and don’t know what to do.

text: [Ontario, Canada] Landlord is charging 13% on rent if I want a receipt. Is this legal? (Update). [Original link here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3m2oiy/ontario_canada_landlord_is_charging_13_on_rent_if/) After doing some research and reading, I talked to my landlord about why he is charging me 13% on rent if I want a receipt. In the discussion, neither of us explicitly said that because rent is tax-exempt, it cannot be taxed (I should have explicitly said this and confronted him, but I did not). He essentially beat around the bush and avoided answering the question directly. The answer that he gave me was that if he gives us a receipt, he must claim the rent as income, thus it will be taxed, and if it will be taxed by the government, then he will pass that tax onto us. I did not record this discussion, although it would have been a good idea... The next month of rent is due soon (the 25th of October for November's rent). What should I do? I paid $2500 + 13% when I signed the lease, and got receipts ($400 for a pro-rated rent for September, $2100 for October and last month). The receipt says ""This is to acknowledge receiving a rental sum of $1,100/- plus taxes from Mr (my name) and Mr (my roommate's name) for the month of ________."" It is signed by me, my roommate, my landlord, and my landlord's wife. I'm kind of lost as to what I should do as November's rent approaches. How can I get back the 13% on $2500 I already paid? How should I pay November's rent (cash? cheque?)? I know I could escalate this and approach the [LTB](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/) or even the [CRA](

text: Landlord Problems: Security Deposit. **EDIT: I have realized that I was wrong, and have taken appropriate action to make the situation right. Thanks /u/rhubey, /u/desertrat13, and /u/34569** Lincoln, NE: I lived in a privately owned apartment complex for two years. The first year I signed a 12 month lease. The landlord and I agree to lease month to month from then on, and I never signed another lease, but stayed there for over 1 year doing it this way. As this apartment complex is close to UNL's campus, and is primarily populated by students, the landlord and I agreed that I needed to either sign another year lease or move out before school started. Everything looked as though I'd be staying, but I never signed another lease. Last minute, well, July 27, a great opportunity arose, and I seized the moment and accepted it. I worked very hard to move out before August 1, and achieved my goal, leaving him just over 3 weeks before the semester began to fill the unit. I found out today that he won't be returning any of my security deposit($400), attributing the cost in an itemized deduction list as rent for August. However, I was completely moved out before August 1 and never signed anything saying that I'd be staying during that month. Remember, I'd been renting month-to-month for over a year. I understand that it's unfortunate that he will probably not have a renter this semester, but I don't think we are legally required to pay rent for a space we weren't using, didn't have keys to, and didn't agree to use for that time. And I don't think he can legally withhold it from us. We always had a very positive relationship with the landlord, and we worked hard to be great, helpful tenants. Quiet, clean, and we even referred 5 friends to his units. [Here](http://uniweb.legislature.ne.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=76-1416)

text: [MI] Assistance with Michigan Tenant Rights: Ex-landlord and final cost issues. My fiancé and I moved out of our old home on 3/1. We did the final walk through with J (landlord), we turned in our keys, and we were told we had until 3/8 (Friday) to remove our personal possessions and 3/29 to pay off the utilities. Fiancé went to the house today to clean out the garage, and saw his Prius was missing. When I initially asked J where the car was taken, he said that police had identified it as abandoned and towed it. False. I called the local PD, and the 3rd party tow lot they use for abandoned vehicles, and neither place had the car. After we informed him of our findings, he wouldn’t respond to it; instead, he had brought up the money owed to him for repairing water damage to the house—the bathroom had flooded while we were out of town and we are being held responsible for cleaning fees and supplies. On Sunday night, J has apparently reported my fiancé’s Prius as abandoned *himself* and had it towed. He told police he had tried to contact us several times about moving the vehicle. Both of these claims are also false. The car was in the driveway (flat off-brand tires and expired tags because we couldn’t afford either expense while also living there, but definitely not abandoned), and he had never once mentioned the car to us. He refuses to even split the cost of the towing, that he falsely reported, until he gets his money. We’re at a loss, and at our wits’ end. There wasn’t an official police report, so nothing can be legally done about false information. We could go to small claims court, but I’m not sure the cost of the tow fee would be worth it. We currently owe him $1477 for water damage repairs and the water bill, but paying him for that and paying to get our car back before the fees surpass the value of the car is...I don’t know the correct way to describe it.

text: [WI] Statute of limitations on molestation allegations?. Hello all, throwaway for obvious reasons. Back in 2011 I received a call from the local middle school's police liaison officer, asking me to come in. He would not say over the phone what it was about. I came and he said that a student told her guidance counselor that when she was 6, I had molested her. The student was the daughter of a family friend. I explained that it couldn't be true and he let me go. The next day, he called and asked if I would be willing to take a polygraph test. I declined because I already knew that they were inadmissible in court and I had nothing to gain by doing so. I told my parents what was happening and they secured an attorney for me just in case. I had never heard back from the officer or district attorney or anybody about it. I assumed they noticed the inconsistencies in her story and decided not to bother continuing an investigation. Her parents maintained that I was guilty, however. I ran into another mutual friend one day and chatted about general stuff, never bringing up the accusing family. A few days later, my mother received a threatening letter from the accusing mother stating that if I ever talk to their friends again, she will tell them ""everything I did"". The attorney had said that the daughter has the opportunity to reopen the case up to a certain number of years after she turns 18. I cannot remember how many years it was. I've since moved to a different city to reduce the risk of running into them in public (grocery shopping or whatever). My main question is, in Wisconsin, how many years after she turns 18 does she have to reopen the case? Essentially, how long until I can breathe a sigh of relief that they aren't going to try and ruin my life over something I hadn't done? Thanks for any insight.

My girlfriend’s bosses son is 13 years old and is told that he is in charge (of a hibachi/sushi restaurant) whenever his mom goes on break or leaves the building. Her son on a daily basis calls my girlfriend fat and ugly during work hours and demands that the other employees need to do their work and tries to separate adults from talking to one another during their shifts because “they need to be working and not talking”. He also claims that he technically is not legally employed since he is only 13 which makes me question how okay all of this is for her boss to do? My girlfriend is now quitting her job because of her bosses unemployed 13 year old son. I’m sure I just sound like I’m complaining but maybe there is something to this, I don’t know. There is a lot more to this but what I have here is the bulk of my question.

One of her two roommates originally appeared sane, but whipped out the crazy not long after my friend moved in. Stuff like refusing to start paying the electric bill and demanding that nobody use the power so that she could delay transferring it from the landlord's name for as long as possible. They finally brought the apartment back into the 21st century, but now the roommate is making another power play. I'm 99% sure she has no legal ground to stand on, but I'd really appreciate r/legaladvice's input. Essentially, the roommate got the landlord to hire her as some kind of overseer/manager/superintendent type of thing for the building. She's now trying to use this position to force everyone in every shared apartment to sign and abide by a ""roommate agreement"" that she wrote herself. She claims that the lease empowers her/the landlord to enforce this agreement ""in legalese"" (her words, repeatedly), and that my friend is required to abide by it even if she refuses to sign it. She apparently kept saying that the lease totally definitely said that, and that my friend was misinterpreting it because she has no legal background. I read the lease and I don't see anything in there about requiring tenants to abide by an additional contract. The ""roommate agreement"" includes many restrictions that are not present in the lease. This is bullshit, right? Am I crazy, or is there no way that a lease could require someone to abide by additional, tighter restrictions set forth in a document they weren't shown until after they signed the lease? And what steps should my friend take to deal with this? Will my friend have legal recourse if the roommate uses her position as

My wife’s mother has been in an abusive marriage for 20 years, I have only been in this family for 8. In July her husband pushed her across a room, breaking her back. She has been out of work and recovering since then. There were no criminal charges filed at the time because she was unconscious and he lied to paramedics and later to the social services investigators. She is too scared to speak up and as of right now nothing is going to happen to him for hurting her. Now for the financial questions. My mother-in-law comes from an upper class background, has a very good job and some inheritance, assets and investments. She makes $128k. Her husband has never had anything, no education, no career and only barely a real job. He makes $40k. In the last year or so he has started making moves on her money, trying to get her house put in his name, demanding that she sign over her upcoming pension to him, telling her she needs to write a new will because he has some requests to put in. He also wants power of attorney over her and has been pushing her to do that. She is 64 years old and plans to go back to work. But she is increasingly having memory problems and both her parents had Alzheimer’s. He has already mentioned (several times, to several people) that she might need to be hospitalized soon, as in “nursing home”. I could list a hundred other ways it seems like he has a master plan here: to get everything of value in his name, then send her away. He isn’t really trying to hide this either. She can’t bring any charges against him for the incident at this point, and will not consider divorce right now for religious reasons. BUT, we had a breakthrough this weekend: she will meet with the family attorney and her two daughters (my wife and her sister). She has agreed to financially protect herself from him. This is huge, because it will define how the rest of her life goes. **THE MAIN QUESTION HERE:** What can we legally

text: Paralegal homework advice. Our assignment is to draft our first complaint. We were told to use any tools available to us (so Reddit isn't cheating ) to figure this out. I am not asking for people to give me all the answers...just point me in the right direction We are to pick the Court jurisdiction and what the tort would be. The facts are, a tenant trashed the rental house and abandoned the house leaving the doors open a week before his lease ended. The lease states the tenant will be liable for all damages to the house. There is $6000 worth of damages to the house. The tenant left with no forwarding address, so their whereabouts are unknown. I think this should be at the Magistrates court as it is a small claims issue but is there something other than Breach of Contract that I should be looking at claiming? This takes place in Georgia. This is due on Monday so any gentle nudges in the right direction would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. **EDIT** I think it is basically a Breach of Contract but our instructor is trying to challenge us to see if there is something other than just that. I am looking into all your suggestions, so again thank you for taking this time to help me

text: Got fired, was offered my job back on the same day (WA). I posted about this in r/personalfinance and some people felt like I should bring it here for some better answers. Long story short, I have had intermittent absences over the past year that should have been covered by FMLA. My employer told me that it wouldn't apply to my situation, so I didn't apply for FMLA. Our company has a strict attendance policy and these absences were counting against me. Earlier this week I had one of these such absences. This morning, I had a meeting with my store manager and signed separation paperwork. When I got home, I called HR and told them the situation. A few hours later, I got a call from my district manager. She was coming from the corporate office and wanted to meet me at my location to chat. After we talked about what happened, she offered me my job back plus some perks, including: -Clean slate on the attendance policy -Better training for GMs regarding FMLA -Wage review within 30 days -Voiding of the separation paperwork. This way if I declined the offer, I would be signing voluntary resignation paperwork instead. It's that last bullet point that makes me a little uncomfortable. On the one hand, quitting looks a lot better on a resume than termination. On the other, it covers their asses if I quit instead of if I were to be fired for this issue. I was told I should ask if this was a situation where I should start looking for employment lawyers. I signed an arbitration clause upon hire, so I don't know if a lawyer can do much for me. But it seems like my employer made a big mistake with FMLA- I should have been notified that I fall under FMLA for my hospitalization last year and the resulting intermittent absences ever since.

text: [PA] Workplace does not have locks on bathroom doors, is this legal?. I work as a CNA at a facility for intellectual and developmentally disabled residents. The particular building that I work in has four restrooms, two intended for residents and two intended for staff. The residents I work with are relatively high functioning and understand which restroom is theirs. There is one resident that has sexual attractions to staff and has been caught multiple times masturbating to staff. They have taken a liking to me and lately has been walking into the bathroom after me. There's nothing I can really do to prevent this as the company will not put a lock on the staff bathrooms door. They will come in once I'm already in the middle of using the restroom and stare at me peeing as I'm pleading with them to please leave. Often times, while I would just sit there until they leave, thet often don't and I'm forced to stand up, further exposing myself, just so I cant pull my pants up and get out of the situation. This puts me in a very uncomfortable position and, while I do document it, I worry that somehow this can fall back on me as my privates are exposed to a resident. I understand the concern from management that the residents might lock themselves in the bathroom but that's what keys are for. Can they legally keep me from having the privacy I deserve to use the restroom?

Location: Ohio Recently I have started to become more independant from my parents and would like to be in only my mother's custody (my father isn't really all that great of a person but isn't horrid). From what I know, the laws in Ohio do not allow me to independantly choose without the parent relinquishing custody. I feel I am mature enough to decide even though I am still a minor and I should be able to choose who should have custody over me and I already spent at 4-6 day of the week entirely with my mother and see my father at most for 3 days of the week, so what would my possible options be?

text: [UK] Abusive ex partner wants custody of daughter?. Let me begin with this, this is about a close family member. She has no money so it’s not possible to get the best lawyers etc. I understand some law firms work with pro-bono but I’ll check more on that later. Full story, this family member we’ll call her Rosa, gave birth to her daughter (Lily) 8 years ago with this guy named Patrick. Their past has involved him abusing her and choking their daughter. When she found strength to leave, they went through social services and mediator because he was sending her threatening messages cause she took their daughter to live with her. She has tried her best to let him have his daughter for visits etc but whilst the daughter was with his family, they were brainwashing the daughter about Rosa’s family. Fast forward 5 years later, Rosa married a man named Joshua. With this marriage they moved further away, she has made Patrick aware that they’ll be moving. During this, she allows Lily to visit her family which allowed Patrick to see Lily only a few times throughout the 1st year of this arrangement. After all this, Rosa did not provide Patrick with her address, but managed to let Patrick meet her 10 miles away from her home to spend the day with Lily. Which only happened once as Patrick complained that it was too expensive to travel to the area Rosa chose. Today, Rosa told me that Patrick has filed a court notion to demand reasonable contact and to know their location, adding that Rosa has no rights to take Lily outside of the country without his permission. He has also stated that he believes Rosa lives in another country because he doesn’t know their current address. What legal ways can this be dropped? I’ve advised Rosa not to be too hysterical as she suffers from depression (which all started due to the abuse Patrick inflicted on her).

text: [CA] Co-tenant refusing to pay rent. I am located in California. I am sharing an apartment (off campus housing near a university) with 3 other people. All 4 of us are listed on the lease. One of the co-tenants is refusing to pay their share of rent. The rest of us have covered the rent payment to avoid incurring any penalties from the landlord. While asking about the rent, they turned hostile and confrontational. I received written confirmation (over the text conversation) that they will move out this weekend, with an explicit date mentioned. I have the following questions- 1. Can they refuse to move out on said date? If yes, what are my options? I have read that 30 days notice is required to evict, but am unclear on how it affects removing 1 of the co-tenants. Will their text saying they are willing to move out on the weekend removing that 30 day requirement? 2. There are unpaid utility bills and their share of the rent. How can I go about pursuing the money? 3. What is the easiest way to replace their name on the lease? The landlord does allow substitution of tenants in the middle of the lease, but if the cotenant doesnt comply with any requirements (signing the transfer of lease etc) can I legally compel them to do so? Any assistance is appreciated

text: What is reasonable notice to show an apartment?. For context, I am located in New York City. I am moving out of my apartment in less than a week. My management company uses one real estate company, and multiple brokers have been contacting me daily to show my apartment since it has been listed. At first, this wasn't an issue as the showings worked with my schedule and I had the space to have people in and out of my apartment. Now they are only giving me anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour notice asking if they can show the apartment. I have less than ample space right now, as moving boxes are everywhere. The movers are coming in a few days and I would be concerned that if someone got hurt here, I would be liable. My lease says that they have to give ""reasonable notice"" to show my apartment - my question is, what is reasonable notice? 45 minutes - 1 hour is not reasonable to me. Additionally, can I decline to show the apartment until I am out of here?

text: Employer Paying Less Than Agreed. I'm an undergraduate in New Jersey, and a few weeks after starting my tutoring job this year at my university, my employer changed the manner in which I am being paid. I signed a form that states ""ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise."" However, a few weeks later, I received an email stating I would be paid for the exact number of hours worked. I had this same job for the past two years, and I was paid for 8 hours while only working 5 hours each week, and the department was fully aware of this. They hired me again without indicating things had changed until after I signed the form. I spoke with the person who sent the email, and she said that she was sorry I misinterpreted the statement ""ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise,"" and that it actually means that it is expected that people with my position will work at most 8 hours. I expected she would say that I am now being ""told otherwise,"" so the contract had not been violated, but that was not the case. It seems like my university may have done something wrong, but I'm not sure. In particular: * The sheet I signed seems pretty informal, and it was clearly made by someone in the department just for this position. It's not some government form with a name. Does that mean it isn't legally binding? * If it is legally binding, does the phrase ""unless told otherwise"" mean that it has not been violated? It seems like the moral thing to do would probably be to tell me before starting to work, but maybe its still legal to do it afterwards. The department totally thinks that the sheet is being violated, but it's possible they're in the clear without realizing it. * Even if it is a binding contract and it has been violated, does that mean anything? Am I supposed to just quit and look for a job elsewhere, or is there something else I ought to do? Thanks for the help.

text: [utah] Have a hoarder tenant but never a formal contract, what are my options?. My wife and I have a mother-in-law's apartment which we rent out, but we've never had a formal agreement and may not even be zoned for subletting, so obviously those were mistakes on our part. She's lived there without issues for a couple years. Recently in the past 6 months or so, she's not spent any time here, instead living with her boyfriend, and she's been late with her rent so we've had to hassle her to make payment each month and we've become fed up with it. We decided we wanted to get a new renter so we checked downstairs to see what condition it's in, and while we knew she was messy and even knew she was an alcoholic, the level of hoarding wasn't something we were prepared for. Hundreds, maybe even a thousand, empty beer cans, clothes everywhere, even a couple of used maxi pads. Clothes, towels, dishes and a few other things of ours that she took without notice, strewn everywhere. The worst is the bathroom where we discovered there was a plumbing issue causing a bowling ball sized hole in the ceiling. There's likely mold and the whole bathroom will need to be remodeled. My questions are: 1) since there was never a contract, do I have to give a certain amount of notice before kicking her out? 2) we intend to give her a chance to get her belongings. How much time do we need to proceed? 3) Is there a way for us to hold her responsible for the damages? I've already taken pictures and video of the current condition and will keep receipts from plumbers, contractors etc. 4) Is there anything I need to be careful of to make sure legal action can't be taken against us? She has no money (we've received default notices from payday loan places recently) but she has police in her family. 5) This is probably a terrible idea, but I really want to give her a deadline to get it taken care

text: My ex-employer won’t give me my last paycheck OR tax paperwork, and may have been misclassifying me as an independent contractor. I have no idea where to begin or what to do.... So I was working at the same place for over ten years, as an “independent contractor” (more on that later). After all of that time being mistreated and used up, with no raises and the constant threat of being fired, I finally decided I’m worth more than that, and I left. I know, I should have a LONG time ago, but I was going through a lot and the idea of not having any I come at all was scary, and he knew that. I gave my two week notice, and he informed me that my “contract that I signed when I started” (which I don’t remember, but he makes things up as he goes and he knew how much of a mess I had been emotionally after my divorce she’s suicide attempt, and that I pretty much always do as I’m told), I had to give him two MONTHS notice. Ok. Fine. I worked until exactly the date that would be two month (it was over the holidays so there were a lot of days I wasn’t working, but my last day was two months to the date that I gave my notice). He got on me the same day that I need to finish the worm quickly and get it processed as people were waiting on it. I did so. Six weeks later I still hadn’t gotten a paycheck. I should pause here and explain that for the past year or so, checks regularly care weeks late, and anytime I said anything, he would tell me it’s the mail. I even flat out caught him lying in two back to back emails that he had put it in the mailbox on two totally different dates. Oh yeah, he also hasn’t sent me my 1099 so I can’t do my taxes. I emailed him, and he said to me that things are messed up because of my “short notice,” and they were in bad shape, but that it would be in the mail by the end of the week.

Our school has a history with malpractice (primarily sexual misconduct towards minors on campus), so I wouldn’t want to tip anybody off to this and have it covered up, with no real action being taken towards fixing this.

We liked the space but it is currently being cleaned and fixed so it was an absolute mess when we went to go see it. We eventually put in a $500 deposit because we like the apartment space and so that we could see it after it was cleaned and fixed. Yesterday (10/5), the broker tells us that the owner wants us to sign the lease this week, saying that he doesn't want to take it off the market and have us back out in the end. We are a bit skeptical to sign the lease plus give 3 x rent (1st month/security/and broker fee) without seeing the end product that we would move into on 11/1. We told the broker that we need a signed document stating that the 3 x rent that we are giving would be fully refundable until we have seen and approved that apartment's condition after the fixes are complete. Do you think it is safe for us to sign the lease with this document? What are your opinions on what I should do?

The officer issuing the ticket informed me that I would receive a notice in the mail with the amount of my fine, and the options I can take to resolve it. I currently live in Reno, Nevada attending university, so dealing with this in person would be difficult. Fast forward nearly 4 months later. I never received a mailed notice, and had forgotten about the ticket. I am visiting home for the first time in about a year, and my father tells me I received a notice from the court; dated 10/7/15 and advising me that I have been found guilty by written declaration, and that a 300$ late fee has been assessed bringing my total fine to $603. A notice at the bottom states that the $300 civil assessment can be removed if contacted within 20 days. Well, here I am receiving the notice from my father 4 days too late, on a Saturday. I am a full time student, and would be hard pressed to pay a $300 fine, let alone $603. I understand that the fine is deserved (I was speeding), but there is no way I can afford the given amount. What are my options here?

In addition, they've tried to cut of the power to the room we stay in, tell us we cannot use the bathroom, put locks on the fridge, turn off the internet, and lock us out of the house. We live in North Carolina.

text: I accepted a Six figure job I can’t start because of on-going contract negotiations between the recruiting company and future employer. So far, I haven’t been working for almost 3 weeks because of this. State:PA. Sorry for the lengthy title. I was trying to condense my situation. I’ll break down the details here: I work in tech. About two months ago I was starting to respond to recruiters to interview since I was ready to leave my current contract position for something where I could grow long term. I liked the company I was working for enough and got along great with my coworkers. This move was purely because I thought it was better for me professionally, not because of any actual work related issues. I mention this because I had no problem waiting it out and taking my time with the interview process. Well long story short, after 3 weeks of interviewing I found myself with 3 offers on the table. All six figures and pretty comparable, except for one thing. The one I chose is 100% remote. Also, it starts off as a contractor for 6 months and then converted to full benefit employee. It’s important to know that everyone who has been placed in the same type of role (they need multiple people for this role since the company is extremely large) has been converted in 6 months. Well, I put in my two weeks, I sign all of the on boarding paper work and pass the background check. Get set up with payroll and am given a start date of October 29. My last day at my old job was the Friday before and I was set to start this position the following Monday. Well, my recruiter calls me on my last day of work and tells me that they were in the process of renegotiating the contract with the new employer and it would just cause a week delay on my start date. No problem. I could just use this week as some unexpected time off before I start. Well, it looks like negotiations went south and has now been an ongoing back and forth between the recruiting company and new employer. I get regular updates and they have been very apologetic about the situation. They keep assuring me they are doing everything they can to push this forward but it has been almost three weeks and they can

text: Sole Custody in NC. What steps do I need to take to file for sole custody for my son? It is just my 2 year old son and I. The father is not on the birth certificate or involved. Will the court go on a hunt trying to track the father down before I can file? What will I be dealing with and what should I expect? The reason I would like to file is because I am worried that the father will come up out of the woodwork in 5 years and want custody. I am in NC and the father is in GA.

text: Running into issues with a gym. Worst decision of my life to get into a gym contract. I'm having issues with a gym that I can't find any information on, they're not even listed on google. About a year an a half ago i started a contract in NY. We had several issues with them, and we got out of our contract in June....or so we (me and my wife) thought. Come the beginning of October, we get calls from collections companies saying we owe money to this gym. Now, I followed the correct protocol and emailed where he said to mail my certified letter when I met the manager in person. Come August, the gym shuts down and moves under a new name. I get a call on my honeymoon in mid-august, they want money. I tell them I canceled the contract, and i sent a certified letter to prove it. She says, oh well text this number when you get back! Sketchy, I call her when I get back multiple times and she never picks up. I email her informing I will put block on my account if she didn't respond, and I provided the tracking number for the certified letter. Nothing. Luckily, my bank happened to give me a new card (for other reasons). I saved her email for proof though. I've emailed them recently asking for a copy of my contract, over a week ago, around the middle of October. Nothing! I can't even find the companies phone number on google, I found it once via the collection company but didn't write it down. I can't find my contract at all, I'm concerned that's going to bite me in the arse. What steps should I take in making sure the collection calls stop an I'm good and rid of them?

text: Trying to get reimbursed by car insurance.. Hi r/legaladvice, A month ago I was involved in a car accident. The other party rear ended me on the highway and it was pretty open and shit as far as who was at fault. It took some time, but I was able to get my car repaired and during the process, I made use of a rental car. Now, I'm trying to get reimbursed for said rental through the other person's insurance and I am getting the run around. The claims representative told me that it could take up to two years before I'd get any reimbursement! I am currently facing $700 for this rental and it's looking like I might never see that money again. Is there anything I can do to get reimbursed? Do I have to seek legal action? Would it even be worth it? I just feel defeated after this whole battle with the insurance company. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Here is some additional information: I live in the United States. The other party member was driving a rental car and had purchased the insurance through the rental company.

text: Colorado: if my roommate signed a new addendum being added onto a pre-established lease, are we now obligated to what she signed for?. I made a previous post in relation to this that was solved. But now I can’t find any answers at all to this question. My landlord is adding a new addendum mid-lease for a valet trash service that is $25 a month. I’m fuming about it and have no intention of using this service. It isn’t legal to add a new addendum without approval of all parties. My roommate is easily pressured and said she felt legally obligated to sign it. I have not yet signed the new addendum. Both of us have our names and signatures on the main lease. Are we now bound to use and pay for this service or does it require both of our signatures? If it fully requires all parties then I was going to decline the addendum.

text: I want to adopt a cat in a flat where pets aren't allowed. What would happen if I get caught?. Hi guys, for more detail, I live in the UK and am renting a flat through a letting agency. My girlfriend has a cat that had kittens roughly a year ago and all of them have been adopted bar one. Her and her family struggle to care for the cats for various reasons. She visits my flat often with this cat and stays for weeks at a time. The cat behaves well in the flat and doesn't leave a mess (I respect that landlords want to keep their property in good conditions). I fell inlove with this cat and would love to adopt him and take him off their hands. In the case that if the agency find out, what would be a probable outcome? Will I get evicted? If so what would happen to my deposit? I have a years lease thats only 7 months through it, do I pay for the rest of the lease? etc. Any help/advice/information would be much appreciated. Cheers!

text: [NY] Landlord is evicting me for owing rent.. I am a college student attending a public university in the state of New York. Back in February, my older brother, who lived in another country, passed away unexpectedly. He was born and raised in this country and had a lot of family there so we decided to pay for his burial there, but due to my parents’ financial situation, I had to use the money I had saved for rent to pay for his funeral costs. This obviously hindered me from paying rent on time and I fell back 3 months. I ended up moving in with my boyfriend (into his apartment) because I was in a terrible mental state, I barely went to class and slept so much and was just not really alive. I tried contacting the apartment building manager and the front desk person told me the only thing I could do was pay in full and sublease my apartment for someone else to take over. I’ve been searching and couldnt find anyone, because it’s the middle of the semester. So two days ago, the person I used to live with at this apartment told me someone came in and handed a paper saying I have a court date in two weeks, and that to stop the eviction process I have to pay in full by tonight. I obviously don’t have that much money available to me. The only option I have is to prepare for the court date and I would like to know what to do; I have no experience at all, or money to hire a lawyer.

text: Broke college student. Hello I need your help. Unfortunately I reared ended the vehicle in front at a low grade speed (5mph) about to make a right turn. It was our right of way ( the light was green) at a four way intersection, however, a pedestrian ran across the street, causing the vehicle in front to do an immediate stop. The accident occurred 10/9/18 around 7:30PM. To me, the damages looked superficial with paint scratches. We agreed to go through the cash process and today 11/5/18, I get a text message stating she was unable to go to the body shop to get an estimate yet and now complains of back pain. She said she’s taking antibiotics and the pain is getting worse. She seems interested in monetary gains and I’m worried, it will exceed my budget. What can I do in legal measures to ensure I pay what was solely necessary? Much appreciated

This is because i was sexually assaulted by my uncle for years and my parents knew about it, and after i turned him in they abused me themselves. My sister (16) (who is in her senior year of highschool and moved out of my parents house this year) told me yesterday when she came over that my parents have been beating my 10 year old sister. I was LIVID and imediatly went to my parents house to check on my sister, she had two black eyes and was obviously in a lot of pain with a bunch of other hand marks all over her body. I want custody of them but how would i go about doing that. Btw, my sisters are both at my place for the time being. I am NOT letting either of them go back into that house.

text: It's that time of year again! Packages are being stolen again. My wife and I moved down to Los Angeles in Sept. 2017. Within a month, we've had a few packages stolen. We live on the first floor, only two doors away from the ""mail room"". The ""mail room"" is out in the open and about two two doors away from the main entrance. After about a year, it's started again. We're now at $500 of stolen items. What we have not done is file any police reports. The entrance to the building is broken. It was broken last year, and we've been in communication with the building manager. It took weeks to get it ""fixed"". The problem is that the door doesn't fully close, so when you open the door, it'll close, but it won't close fully. My wife _just now_ witnessed the UPS driver open the door, deliver the packages, and through no fault of his own, left the building with the door slightly open. This is how the thieves are stealing the packages. My building manager recently had their package stolen and was extremely upset. So upset that they stayed in the lobby area watching people walk in and out leaving the door slightly opened. The building manager saw my wife walk towards a delivery person use the building code to get in. The building manager confronted my wife accusing her of giving away the building code, concluding that, that was the reason why packages were being stolen. Last year, I put up a sign to remind people to close the door. It was promptly removed. &amp;nbsp; I'm unsure what else to do. Would it be recommended to contact the management company directly and make a complaint? Their website is _broken_, and they only have _one e-mail address_ that we know of. Would this cause more trouble? I see that it's either very difficult for the building manager to do anything, or they've been dragging their feet. I'd like to start a paper trail, but unsure if my method is heavy handed. I don't want to call as it won't leave a trail.

Any help anyone can provide will be greatly appreciated. This is what happened: I was incarcerated in the Missouri Department of corrections and have recently been released. About a month before i was released i got into a verbal altercation with another inmate (in a cell where there were no cameras, and 3 other cell mates present) He pushed me a total of three times yelling (come on Motherf%&amp;er and as he was coming at me a fourth time (with fist closed this time) i hit him once in the face. Not hard enough to even leave a mark. and then proceeded to dodge the rest of his blows. he landed several body blows and no facial hits at all. (i swung a few times back but none connected) This is where it gets fed up. Somehow near the end of all of it he started getting very frustrated as he wasn't really doing much of anything and just started going crazy with his arms.. Well i talked to all of my cell mates and none of us can figure out HOW it happened.. but he hurt his arm... Broke it. the fight stopped.. He went and told the Correctional officer that he hurt his shoulder (he told us initially that it was his shoulder that was fucked up, What we all THINK happened is he hit his arm on my hip at a weird angle and broke it) Hard to believe, but it happened. Well there was a shit storm that followed.. Everyone was interviewed by the higher ups that run the camp, Including the warden as they had to send him out to the hospital to get surgery done. They ALL thought that someone did that to his arm on purpose (aka held him down and tweaked his arm, etc.) I told them i didn't see anything. Somehow i managed to slip through the cracks and

text: Former landlord is not responding to calls, texts, or emails regarding our security deposit.. I recently moved to Indiana, but I was living in Minnesota— from what I can gather, state law there gives landlords 3 weeks to either give you your security deposit back, or tell you what they're making deductions for. Keys were turned over on August 30th, it's now October 8th. When my roommate and I contacted our landlord about our security deposit, he said that he wasn't sure if he'd be making deductions, or if so, how many. He said that the apartment looked great, but that there was some wearing on the wooden floors that he was going to have to decide whether or not he wanted to replace. ""Ok, fine,"" we said, and asked him to let us know. We asked him more about the security deposit, 5 times in total, and he continues to avoid saying whether or not we'll get it back, or if we do, if he's making any deductions, and for what. The new tenants moved in on September 1st, so if he's planning on doing floor repairs, he would have to move them out before starting that. I totally understand that tenants are responsible for paying for damage to the unit, and if he says the floors are damaged, OK. But he's gone totally off the grid in terms of communicating with us about our security deposit, has not told us whether or not we'll get it back, and only vaguely implied that there may or may not be some damage that he may or may not be repairing. Is he legally entitled to keep stringing us along like this, or is he just hoping we'll give up and leave our $650 with him without asking for specifics on deductions? Thanks all for your help!

Now, my investment (in the form of several years of reduced salary) is gone. How can I better protect myself next time?. So, ended up joining the company at half salary on the expectation that I’d be rewarded later. We were all new at this, so we were kinda winging it. Initially, it was going to be some sort of debt bond, but for a bunch of reasons, ended up with stock options. Company ran out of cash and ceased operations. Bankruptcy proceedings are likely starting soon. Options are worthless now. The next time I talk myself into joining a startup, is there some sort of legal agreement that I can enter into that would give me a claim as a creditor in case of bankruptcy proceedings?

The owners of the restaurant also own the place we are living in. They let their employee's (I guess they only ever have 1 employee at a time) live in this place rent and utilities free. They don't pay anything at all and the only money my mother makes is from her tips from when she is a waitress there 1 or 2 nights a week, every other night it's her cooking and cleaning and she's been working 70+ hours a week since starting there. Earlier today when her shift started she brought up how she is worn out from the 70+ hours a week and the husband of the couple that are the owners said he'd talk to his wife about letting her work 50 hours instead and still waitress a night or 2 a week. The wife goes nuts and starts to scream at my mother so my mom said she quit and walked out. After I went to work today the husband came over to our place and handed my mom a hand written eviction notice that said we had 72 hours to get out (so until this Friday the 6th). He also threatened her saying his wife would come over here and physically assault my mother. We've only live here for around a week to a week and a half but my mother has worked for them for a bit longer, close to a month now. We would have lived here longer already but they had to evict their last tenant due to her quitting as well (they've been through 7 people in the last couple of months). I need help figuring out if the 72 hour notice is actually legal or not.

[Michigan]. **Main information** I just received a letter on my door today stating that my storage unit needs to be cleaned out by Nov 23rd by 5pm and that they will be cleaning out ANY AND ALL items that are left the morning of the 24th. They are doing this to clean them and relabel all vacated units. They offer to transfer my items to the appropriate unit. I can take a picture of the notice if need be but that is pretty much what they typed up word for word. I contacted my landlord and said I just got the notice and that I have no where to put the contents of my unit for them to clean it out, however I did clean it out BEFORE I put my stuff in it (It was in bad condition cleanliness wise) and offered to move my stuff to a different unit AFTER they clean a different one out for me to use if need be, and then informed them of what unit I was using because none of them are numbered and many tenants over the years have crossed off old names &amp; numbers people before them wrote on the doors. Their response was ""i'll letcha know"". My unit is padlocked at all times, but I plan on going down there to take pictures to have proof of what the contents of the unit are. I know there doesn't seem to be an issue yet but my question is seeing as how they gave me less than 2 weeks notice if they choose to is it legal for them to dispose of my things? **Extra information, possibly important?** The only reason I am asking is because this complex is ran very unprofessionally and after I signed the lease I was at the bar and the landlord saw me so we had a couple drinks together (have a picture to prove it) nothing sexual happened between us but shortly after that she has been very hostile towards me and recently posted a ""final warning"" on my door about noise complaints even though they do not keep paper records of complaints and I have had the cops called on me at least 5 times and every time the cops came out told me I was not in violation because I printed off the city sound

text: Upstairs flat, potential child abuse? (UK). My boyfriend and I just moved into a new flat, and there have been a few things that stick out as unusual about the people living upstairs. We aren’t 100% sure on any of this so are just looking for opinions and potential next steps based on what you guys think. The first thing we noticed was this thudding that would happen over and over on our ceiling. Initially we just thought it was the kid maybe climbing onto its bed and jumping off over and over. But later we started to put together a few other odd things that made it seem a little more suspect. For instance, when we first moved in there was a strange man who was ethnically different to both mother and son who we know live upstairs, and seemed a little sheepish, and not like he was coming home, and we never saw that man again. Not weird in itself, but there are frequently new adults at their door or acting strangely coming in and out, like hanging around the front door. One guy returns often and always looks shifty when leaving. Late one weekday evening there were several adults at once waiting to be let in - again not particularly suspect on its own, but odd nonetheless to be having so many people over so late on a school night with a relatively young child in the house. We haven’t really spoken to the parents yet - they haven’t seemed to want to stop and say hi in the hall if we happen to pass (which we rarely do anyway due to having different schedules). Whenever the child is home almost all the time we hear him crying upstairs or screaming. Or otherwise the thudding. I know children can cry a lot, but this does seem unusually excessive (happens morning &amp; evening). The last thing we want to do is ruin someone’s life and get authorities involved in a harmless situation, and it’s possible we’re adding up 2 and 2, and getting 5 - we just wanted some general opinions! TL;DR - constant child crying, thudding on the ceiling, strange adults (usually male) coming and going. Any red flags?

text: how to best terminate a parents parental rights?. hi, my child is 4 and I'm looking to get them a passport this year. I was told I would need the other parent present to sign off on it.... here's some background.... he has not been in my Childs life since my child was about 6mo old... his involvement ended when a DV situation happened towards me while our child was on my lap.... we have not heard from him since. I do not receive child support of any kind I have been the sole caretaker and provider since my child was born. we now live in a different state than the other parent and have no contact. my intentions aren't to sever their potential future relationship but I think when my child is older they can decide for themselves if and when they want to reach out. until then its very practical and way more convenient for our everyday lives to remove him from the birth certificate and terminate rights especially since he is not presently, emotionally, or financially contributing what so ever. I want to clarify that we have never had a parenting plan, there has never been any legal documents establishing anything other than the birth certificate signed at time of birth. I Waited a few years to see if anything would change and it hasn't.... was going to wait a few more but was wondering if now is a good time or if things would go smoother if the child is a bit older? my worry is that he will try to refuse this out of temporary pride and we will be stuck in the same situation for potentially longer in the event that he did refuse. I would of course provide evidence to combat that, but want to know what would be the best evidence for a clear and concise case since he's been completely absent I'm not sure what evidence to provide. just trying to plan for worst case scenario. I've tried googling this matter and I didn't get any clear advice on how to go about this other than general information. any advice would help, I want to be fully prepared and knowledgable while making sure I'm going down the smartest path confidently. thank you in advance.

Hey r/legaladvice, &amp;#x200B; These past few months have been hell for me and I'm not sure I'm doing any of this right. I live in Utah, my EX (F19) (never married) and I (M23) have a son who is about to turn 4 months old. A month before his birth we separated. The cause of separation was money issues, family disagreements, and my stress levels caused me to become distant toward her. I'm also fairly irresponsible and lied about having more money than I actually did. When she moved out I was furious and was pretty aggressive in subsequent messages. I called her a ""[retard](https://imgur.com/9m3P3pA)"" amongst other colorful names. In context, my insults and name calling make sense. It's more complicated than that, but those are the basics. Fast forward 2 days before his birth, [we agreed on a name with his last name being our last names hyphenated](https://imgur.com/eR8GJuZ). We both agreed to this although I was a little bitter about it. I didn't find out he was born until 12 hours after he was. When I got to the hospital I found out she [changed his name again](https://imgur.com/DZbHE40) and cut my last name out completely. She said she [refused to put me on the birth certificate](https://imgur.com/aboipQo). In Utah, that is her right apparently. When I started getting upset she told me I could either calm down or leave. So, wanting to be with my son, I calmed down. After a few weeks and only having seen him at the hospital, I was messaging her asking when I could come see him. Things ramped up and I got [this](https://imgur.com/uzmnxEQ) from her.

text: Landlord refuses to let me break the lease without paying 3x rent despite noise complaints stretching back 9 months. Here’s the situation: I moved into a new apartment in July 2018, and immediately noticed that the upstairs neighbors were stomping/banging around, even during quiet hours. I spoke to management about it at the time, and things got better for about a week. Then, they started to get worse again, and it became unbearable in December. I reached out to management again, who this time lied about reaching out to the upstairs neighbors about the issue. That manager left in January, and I didn’t receive a follow up on the issue until February. Since that time, I’ve been trying to resolve the situation almost daily. It started with me requesting a rent reduction or free parking, or even moving units. Management seemed amicable to this, but nothing was ever formally offered. Keep in mind that by this point, the noise had gotten so bad that it was keeping me up at 12:30-1 am (who lets their kid stay up that late??). Last week, I decided to start looking elsewhere for living arrangements, and fell in love with a place nearby. When I approached management about breaking the lease, they told me that I had the option to either buy out with 3x rent plus the concession I received at the beginning of the lease (the which I planned to reimburse anyway) and 30 a pro-rated amount until move out. Since I didn’t want to pay almost 10,000 dollars to move out of a situation I’ve been trying in good faith to remedy for months, I contested that, and have been holding management’s feet to the fire. I told them that I knew my legal right to quiet enjoyment per Washington state law, but the best they seem to be willing to give me is to move me 2 doors down the hall. Too little, too late. When I pressed the regional manager to let me out of the lease, she told me she needed to speak to her lawyer about the lease terms, which leads me to believe that they know they’re in the wrong. Seeing as I stand to lose quite a bit of money if they come after me,

text: [TX] Is my Non-Compete Clause enforceable?. I am a young (entry level) engineer working in Texas for a contractor that made me sign a non-compete clause as part of my pre-employment paperwork approximately a year ago. I have an offer on the table from a client to go work for them. My non-compete clause basically says I can't work for a client until 18 months after my termination. I have heard that most of these are unenforceable in right-to-work states, especially if I didn't sign something saying ""I will take 'X' in exchange to stay here for 'X' years,"" and particularly if I have no company secrets (I don't).

text: (IL) Selling burial estates. I am going through some financial hardships since I am not currently employed. My father handed me the deed to two estates (four spaces per estate) in a Jewish cemetery based outside of Chicago and gave me permission to sell the plots since they no longer live in Illinois and they have already gotten new graves in Virginia. The deed is made out to five people: my parents, my two older sisters, and myself in joint tenancy. The deed was executed in 1985 for the amount of $2,400.00. Doing some basic research online, I need to have the permission of my two sisters before I can agree to sell it. Also, since it is a Jewish cemetery, it is recommended that I speak with the cemetery first since I can not just sell to anyone online as the purchaser may not be Jewish. Assuming my sisters grant me permission as well, what steps should I take to facilitate this type of transaction? What costs or surcharges should I expect? Can I adjust the selling price based on inflation? I apologize if this is less of a legal question and more of a financial query. I also apologize in advance if the flair selected is not correct. I am a Reddit newbie, but I can handle it if you're a little rough!

text: Friend likely being fired for posting nude pictures on social media. Location is Arizona, US hi everyone, i’m posting on behalf of a friend because their social media is currently being monitored by their employer. i have a friend that supplements their income by creating &amp; selling independently created porn. they advertise heavily on social media (mostly twitter). their employer found their twitter account &amp; called them in to say that management is “investigating” but it’s been heavily implied that they’ll be fired for this. i know that arizona is an at-will state, but this seems like discriminatory action as they’ve done nothing illegal and the account in question is completely anonymous. there’s no reference to the employer or the employee in question and there’s no location on it. i’ve advised them to get everything from the employer in writing in the meantime, but they’re understandably concerned about being fired but also facing harassment at work because of this. my friend would like to speak to a lawyer about the issue, but they’re worried about contacting a lawyer that isn’t sex work/er friendly. any (legal) advice would be greatly appreciated.

text: Falsely accused of what I assume is sexual child abuse. Hello, everyone. I'm in a bit of a situation and I need help. So I have a neighbor I've known for well over a decade. I've known her daughter since she was under a year old. I moved into this place about 4 years ago, when I was married. My wife was the neighbor's cousin, and we are since divorced. Anyway, during the marriage, the neighbor's daughter would come over frequently to talk and play with my wife. Listening to music, singing, playing Rock Band, so on. Well, after the divorce she quit coming around, for obvious reasons. I divorced her cousin. Anyway, she came over a few months ago, asking if she could use my computer and internet to work on a school project. I said sure, and there were no problems. Well, she came over a few times after for the same reasons. Yesterday she came over and asked if she could listen to music (note I'm one of the only people in this complex with a computer and internet) so she could pick out a song to request for her boyfriend at their upcoming school dance. I said sure, and I played the songs for her while I was talking to my friends online. After listening to the songs over and over and working on a drawing for her boyfriend, she left to go home. This evening, I was in the shower getting ready to leave for a play I am in, and there was a knock at the door. My girlfriend answered, and it was the girl's mother. She told my girlfriend that her daughter said I'd asked her to take her clothes off while she was here. She informed my girlfriend that her daughter had lied about this before, and just wanted to know what happened. A short while after, I was going to go talk to her, and she'd already called the police. I had to leave to go to the play, and while I was gone, the officer came over. She told the officer where I was, and he said that was fine, but demand that she have me call him first thing in the morning to ask me questions. I obviously

text: [Oh] shot paintballs at people and received a citation, what can I expect?. Ok for starters I know I'm an ass and everything. With that said me and 4 friends were driving around a college town at about 1:00 at night, we shot at a few moving cars and a few groups of college kids. On top of the college area, we shot just cars and houses in another nearby area. The police told us 3 people had called in complaints about us. ( were pretty sure it was just the college area calling in). When their lights flashed we pulled over quickly, we complied with the officers request, me and one friend confessed on the third time they asked who shot, and we were in general being compliant and the police left seemingly happy saying goodnight and everything.(they were easygoing so I don't think anybody got seriously injured). Anyways my friend and I got a misdemeanor citation form that said we were disturbing the peace, (wit:shooting pedestrians with a paintballs gun.) So what I would like to know is what a likely outcome to this could be/ how important would it be to get a local lawyer before my first court date/ is there anyway too keep it off my permanent record (only other punishment I would definitely want to avoid is jail time), and if it's possible what are some options I have for keeping it off my permanent record? Thanks and sorry if I gave too much/too little information, let me know if it's the latter

text: Bank has overdrawn our mortgage payment. Hello folks. Hoping for some help. We have a large mortgage with a small local bank, who actually owns our mortgage, since we are a safe risk financially speaking. We do not have a consumer account with this bank. We closed on the mortgage in August and the first payment was due on October 1. The bank has no online portal or internet presence. Because of this, we were being asked to hand-deliver our mortgage check to the consumer branch of the bank who owns the mortgage once a month. This was a huge inconvenience for my family for a number of reasons. I visited the branch and arranged for an ACH withdrawal from our bank to their bank starting on October 1, and every first of the month thereafter. On October 1, the bank that owns our mortgage withdrew TWO months worth of mortgage payments, which is a large sum. Assuming this was an error easily fixed, I visited the branch where the manager acknowledged the error and advised the payment would be reversed. This was 9 days ago now. I’ve had back and forth calls with them and their mortgage department with no tangible results. We are approaching halfway through the month and they’re certainly making interest off of this large mortgage payment. Do we have legal options? If so, what are they? What’s the simplest way to resolve this? Thanks in advance!

The boss pulled me aside one day and told me he was aware and had the screenshot and said that if I was fired and did apply for unemployment (I'm not trying to live off it, just better safe than sorry) that I would be denied it because he states that the proof of me looking for a job is enough to not get unemployment benefits.

text: Sons father going after SOLE custody. Some background- when my son was 1 we moved to another state, the courts ended up giving me sole custody because my sons father wasn’t active in his life. When my son was almost 6, we moved back to Maine and I allowed his father to see him every weekend(at this point visitation was completely up to me) Last year we had to move from our apartment and I was having a very hard time finding a new one. I was offered a job and an apartment in Florida to work for a company that I had already worked for and because of the situation I decided it was the best option for all of us. We moved and I received paperwork from my sons father for a PFA/restraining order that would have been on behalf of my son and his father- the judge dropped the case at court(so it wasn’t a big deal) I received custody papers and even though I was resentful towards my sons father, I offered him all vacations- including summer. The first vacation was winter vacation and a couple weeks before my son was set to go, his father said he wasn’t going to pay for any tickets until summer. The courts had lowered his child support to me in lieu of him paying for these tickets for his son to come see him. I ended up feeling bad for my son and paid the one way for him, for winter and spring. Now to current- I lost my job in Florida(because it wasn’t making enough money and my boss would take this out on me) I had come back here to pick up my other son from his grandmothers and decided then and there that I was going to stay here(also where my other sons father lives and where my son currently is) because our new custody papers are pretty lenient- I asked his father to keep our son until I was on both feet(my own apartment and a job). I texted him a couple of days ago to let him know that I’d have an apartment soon and that we could split up the custody more evenly. That night I received court papers with a motion for him to get sole custody. I know it’s pretty far fetched that

text: Police Report Says My Car Was in an Accident - It Never Was. This is a throwaway. Ok, this may be long, and pretty odd, but I'll start from the beginning. I'm interested in trading in my car, a white 2013 Subaru Impreza Wrx. The dealer I was in contact with ran a Carfax, showed up there was an accident that occurred in July of 2014 in a different state (Ohio) than I live in (PA). (During this time it was my dad's car, when he passed away I inherited it.) This was obviously odd, this car has been in my family since it was brand new - I know for a fact it was never in an accident, nor have we ever been in the state where the report came from. I submitted a research request to Carfax, they provided me with the number of the police department who reported the accident and the case number. They also provided me with some other info - like the color of the car in the report, which was reported green. My car is white. I called the police department and they supplied me with more info. The woman at the PD confirmed the VIN number and the license plate number of the car in the accident, and confirmed the color of the car reported was green. It came up as my car, my father as the owner too. The report stated the car was driven by a young guy, I'll call him Alan, who lives in the area where the accident happened, and a passenger from my state. I was provided their contact info, and I called and left a message for Alan. As well as getting their information, I got the policy number for the insurance provided by Alan. I called the insurance provider for the driver. I gave the rep the policy number I was given, and it did come up as Alan. The insurance rep could only give me so much info, but he was able to help me out a little. Alan was never insured for a car like mine. He did have a Subaru, two Legacys but never an Impreza. Also, he did not have a policy with this insurance company in July when the accident happened.

There is currently a rat infestation and the building management is stating that their only job is to set traps on the fifth floor. I spoke to my landlord about securing the unit and filling up the holes that the rats have created and he says that that is the building management’s responsibility. Currently I have trapped 5 rats in glue traps and snap traps. I only go to pick up clothes and I run out. Do I have grounds to break my lease and get my deposit back? Is my landlord liable for anything? Also, the reason I know it’s the whole fifth floor and not just my apartment that is infested is because the building manager told me herself that I am no the only one of the 5th floor that has complained. I believe this started because there was a fire on the sixth floor and they have to pull out a lot of dry wall on the fifth floor because of water damage. (I don’t know if that’s relevant or not).

My wife and I seperated 7 months ago, which I have discussed extensively in /r/relationships, and after getting back on my feet I do have some questions regarding what happens next and what I can do to safeguard my assets. A bit of background; we were only married for circa 6 months before she decided that she could not longer commit to a relationship or our marriage and it all broke down. From what I can fathom this all stemmed from some family trauma on her side and I did everything I could over a period of 5/6 months to fix our relationship/marriage before realising that enough was enough and moved on. I should note, before I continue, that we have no kids together and we do not own/share a house. We were living with family while we saved to buy somewhere but have been with our own families since the seperation. From what I understand of the laws here in the UK I will have to wait until we have been seperated for 2 years, if she consents, or 5 years, if she does not, to get a divorce. This leaves two massive problems for me: 1) Because I have moved back in with my parents, my savings are starting to build up. 2) I want to buy a house eventually. The issue I have with both of these two points is can she take half my savings, or my house if I buy one? And is there anything I can do to stop her; whether it be a formal agreement or something else? The other point worth stating is a week before she decided to end the relationship, I lent her £6,000 to be put towards a new car. This was most definitely a loan, which she knew, but I made no contract with her and just bank transferred the money across. This may seem stupid now but at the time I didn't know what was coming... Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for any help you can give.

My dad died in February of 2014 and to my knowledge there was no will. My step-mother claims there is and that everything was left to her. I called the county's probate office and they said ""No will has been submitted to this office"". She claimed his life insurance policy (250,000), selling the house for $410,000+, and gets monthly checks because my dad was in the military and had survivors benefits. She has told me that there was a will and that he gave everything to her (me and my father had a close relationship by the way). I read that in FL, if there is no will children get half the estate and spouse gets the other half. My father also had land in Texas (where I currently live). So, question(s): 1.If I called the probate office and there was nothing on file, does that mean the will was never submitted or that there truly was no will? 2. Do the children truly get half the house? 3. If so, how do we go about getting our portion? 4. How does the land in TX work out? I am contacting a lawyer today but just want to be prepared for anything. I also have a real estate lawyer lined up in FL if need be. Any help or suggestion or comments will be appreciated! Thanks!

text: Parental rights question involving polyamory. Hi, everyone. My boyfriend and his social circle have been trying to help out their friend (who we'll call John) when it comes to leaving his crazy girlfriend, but there's a roadblock. We're in Pennsylvania. A few years ago John got into a polyamorous relationship with Susan and Jennifer. Before John came into the picture Susan and Jennifer were living as a lesbian couple. John thought he hit the jackpot because he went from 0 women to 2 women, and sometimes threesomes - and he ended up moving in with them. But then they wanted to get pregnant. John agreed to act basically as a sperm donor for them and was adamant that he didn't care because they weren't going to be his kids. However, going through the pregnancies and living with the children and, you know, totally acting as their father (feeding them, taking them to school, etc.), John has fatherly feelings for the children and sees them as his. He loves those kids. John is not on either child's birth certificate. We know that he signed something regarding the child he had with Jennifer to give up his rights (not sure if he signed anything with Susan for that child). Now, Jennifer is an extremely toxic person. She finds every way possible to make John's life hell. She'll throw fits to keep him from leaving the house, for example. Just picture the stereotypical toxic girlfriend from hell, then times it by five and that is Jennifer. Jennifer's insane behavior led Susan to leave the relationship with her, but all 3 of them still live in the same house and raise the kids together. Whenever John does something Jennifer doesn't approve of, she will hint (or outright say) that she will take their daughter away from him and he won't be allowed to see her. John stays in this terrible relationship in order to stay in his daughter's life. (His relationship with Susan is pretty normal and Susan has never threatened to take their son away. They basically co-parent.) John wants to leave the relationship and find someone normal but still be able

text: [OR-USA] Shared Car Insurance Policy - Opening Myself up to Liability?. My boyfriend and I are both needing to get our own insurance policies for the first time (we've been on our parents until now). He's 26 and I'm 25. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I've been getting lots of insurance quotes and calling around to get information. I like the insurance agent I have used since I've been licensed because he explores and shows me all of my options, but I want to make sure the one he's suggesting doesn't open me up to any scary liability in worst case scenario situations. After playing with all of the options for my own plan, he suggested looking at an option for us together. It ends up saving me, personally, $400 per year, to have him on the plan so we qualify for the multi-vehicle discount. I've been with my boyfriend for about nine years so I don't see us splitting up, so that's not a worry. We're also not going to get married anytime soon, if any of you were wondering. I do have a much more sizable amount of money than he does. My net worth is about 85x his. My main concern is protecting myself and not making any decisions that could be financially/legally risky. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I'm getting quoted for a 500/500/500 insurance plan and having him on the policy would reduce the yearly cost by over $400, just for me alone. &amp;#x200B; **I emailed the agent the following question (names changed for privacy):** &amp;#x200B; &gt;Tom, &gt; &gt; I know we just talked, but I just wanted to double check on a few things.

text: Epidemiologic risk factors for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Buenos Aires, Argentina: a matched case-control study. The risk factors that predisposed 516 hospitalized and 154 ambulatory patients to acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) are examined in a matched case-control study. The control group was selected from children attending immunization and well-baby clinics at the same institution that was treating the children with ALRI. Sex, age, nutritional status, socioeconomic level, as well as season and place of residence were used as matching criteria. Because of their distinct profiles, hospitalized and outpatient groups were analyzed separately. However, the four variables with the highest odds ratios (incidence ratios or relative risk) were found to be the same for both groups. These variables were related to the host's condition (bronchial hyperreactivity, presence of persistent symptoms of the upper respiratory tract), family (presence of acute respiratory tract disease in household members), and environment (indoor contaminants).

text: A standard dose of radiation for ""microscopic disease"" is not appropriate. Elective irradiation of sites of potential occult tumor spread is often part of a patient's radiation therapy program. The required radiation dose (D) depends on the probability that occult disease exists (P(occ)), the number of sites at risk (A), the number of tumor clonogens present (Ni), their radiation sensitivity, and the desired control rate. An exponential model of cell survival is used to quantify the importance of these factors. Control Probability = [1 - Pocc x (1 - e-Ni x (SF2)D/2)]A; SF2 = surviving fraction after 2 Gy. Implications for clinical radiation therapy include: 1. Since the number of clonogens in an occult site may vary from 10 degrees to 10(8), Ni is the major determinant of the required dose. The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of the clonogens (SF2) is also extremely important in determining the dose. Other factors are less influential since they vary less. 2. The variability of Ni (8 logs) is larger than the variation in cell number seen with gross disease (1 cm3 versus 1000 cm3, 3 logs). When Ni approximately 10(8), the required dose approaches that needed for small volume gross disease (10(9) cells, 1 cm3). 3. The dose prescribed to elective sites should reflect the risk of occult disease based on the primary tumor site, stage, and grade. 4. Regions where clinicoradiologic evaluation is difficult (e.g., pelvis and obese neck) require higher doses because macroscopic tumor deposits may exist. 5. Relatively low doses (10 to 30 Gy) are often thought to be inadequate for microscopic tumor. However, similar doses have been reported to sterilize microscopic tumor in ovarian, rectal, bladder, breast, and head and neck carcinomas. Relatively low doses should not be discounted since they may be useful in select cases when normal tissue tolerances and/or previous irradiation treatment limit the radiation dose.

text: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of vater. A case of absence of somatostatin in a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, bombesin-, and cholecystokinin-producing tumor. A 31-year-old patient with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice had surgical treatment, and a primary carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater (VA) was found. The tumor was studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The neoplasm had histopathologic and cytopathologic features similar to those encountered in typical neuroendocrine neoplasms. It is interesting that immunohistochemical techniques disclosed the presence of vasointestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and bombesin; however, unlike most neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in VA, no somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were found.

text: Sexual and physical abuse in women with functional or organic gastrointestinal disorders. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of a history of sexual and physical abuse in women seen in a referral-based gastroenterology practice, to determine whether patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders report greater frequencies of abuse than do patients with organic gastrointestinal diseases, and to determine whether a history of abuse is associated with more symptom reporting and health care utilization. DESIGN: A consecutive sample of women seen in a university-based gastroenterology practice over a 2-month period was asked to complete a brief questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The self-administered questionnaire requested information about demographics, symptoms, health care utilization, and history of abuse. Physicians indicated the primary diagnosis for each patient and whether she had ever discussed having been sexually or physically abused. RESULTS: Of 206 patients, 89 (44%) reported a history of sexual or physical abuse in childhood or later in life; all but 1 of the physically abused patients had been sexually abused. Almost one third of the abused patients had never discussed their experiences with anyone; only 17% had informed their doctors. Patients with functional disorders were more likely than those with organic disease diagnoses to report a history of forced intercourse (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.21) and frequent physical abuse (odds ratio, 11.39; CI, 2.22 to 58.48), chronic or recurrent abdominal pain (odds ratio, 2.06; CI, 1.03 to 4.12), and more lifetime surgeries (2.7 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.03). Abused patients were more likely than nonabused patients to report pelvic pain (odds ratio, 4.05; CI, 1.41 to 11.69), multiple somatic symptoms (7.1 compared with 5.8 symptoms; P less than 0.001), and more lifetime surgeries (2.8 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a history of sexual and physical abuse is a frequent, yet hidden, experience in women seen in

Gonadoblastoma, a rare gonadal neoplasm, presents most frequently in phenotypic female or phenotypically male patients with dysgenetic gonads or undescended testes. To date, only 2 cases of gonadoblastoma have been reported in anatomically normal male patients with scrotal testes. Both of these patients presented with testicular masses and germ cell tumors. We report a case of a genotypically and phenotypically normal, fertile man with descended testes who on evaluation for chronic orchialgia had a gonadoblastoma unaccompanied by a germ cell neoplasm.

text: Retrovirus-induced spongiform myeloencephalopathy in mice: regional distribution of infected target cells and neuronal loss occurring in the absence of viral expression in neurons. The Cas-Br-E murine leukemia virus (MuLV) induces a spongiform myeloencephalopathy resulting in a progressive hindlimb paralysis. We have used in situ hybridization with a Cas-Br-E MuLV-specific probe to study viral expression in the central nervous system. Infected cells were concentrated in regions where spongiform lesions and gliosis are detected (lumbosacral spinal cord, brainstem, deep cerebellar regions), suggesting a causative link between the level of virus expression and the degree of pathological changes in this disease. However, viral expression was not in itself sufficient to cause disease, since significant viral expression was observed in regions that did not exhibit pathological changes (cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, peripheral nervous system). In both diseased and nondiseased regions, endothelial and glial cells were identified as the main target cells. Neurons in diseased regions did not show viral expression. The regional distribution of the spongiform changes appears to be laid down very early following infection, since expression could be detected at 10 days postinfection in regions that become diseased. These results indicate that nonneuronal cells have distinct properties in various regions of the central nervous system and suggest an indirect mechanism of neuronal loss consequent to viral expression in nonneuronal cells.

text: Ventricular tachycardia in two patients with AIDS receiving ganciclovir (DHPG). We report two cases of patients who developed ventricular tachycardia while receiving intravenous infusions of ganciclovir [9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methylguanine, DHPG]. Worsening cytomegalovirus infection prompted renewal of ganciclovir therapy under close cardiac monitoring in one of these patients, and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The close temporal relationship between administration of the drug and onset of the arrhythmias in conjunction with the absence of other factors known to predispose to arrhythmias suggest that ganciclovir may have played a role in the development of arrhythmias in these patients. The clinical courses of the patients are discussed, as are autopsy results.

text: A mutation in the gene for type III procollagen (COL3A1) in a family with aortic aneurysms. Experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that familial aortic aneurysms, either thoracic or abdominal, are caused by mutations in the gene for type III procollagen (COL3A1) similar to mutations in the same gene that have been shown to cause rupture of aorta and other disastrous consequences in the rare genetic disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. A family was identified through a 37-yr-old female captain in the United States Air Force who was scrutinized only because many of her direct blood relatives had died of ruptured aortic aneurysms. The woman was heterozygous for a single-base mutation that converted the codon for glycine 619 of the alpha 1(III) chain of type III procollagen to a codon for arginine. Studies on cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrated the mutation caused synthesis of type III procollagen that had a decreased temperature for thermal unfolding of the protein. The same mutation was identified in DNA extracted from pathologic specimens from her mother who had died at the age of 34 and a maternal aunt who died at the age of 55 of aortic aneurysms. Examination of DNA from samples of saliva revealed that the woman's daughter, her son, a brother, and an aunt also had the mutation. The results demonstrated that mutations in the type III procollagen gene can cause familial aortic aneurysms and that DNA tests for such mutations can identify individuals at risk for aneurysms.

The infant had emergency right heart catheterisation and Rashkind septostomy for severe desaturation due to transposition of the great arteries. During the exposure of the saphenous vein, the superficial femoral artery was accidentally severed at it's origin. An attempt to restore the circulation by end-to-end anastomosis failed and resulted in persistent limb ischemia for over 4 hours. The baby was reoperated upon, the damaged part of the superficial femoral artery was resected and a saphenous vein graft interposed between the common and the distal superficial femoral artery.

text: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus. A clinicopathologic study of three cases. In a group of 245 cases of primary carcinoma of the esophagus the authors found three cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Clinical and pathologic data of those patients (one female and two male; age range, 49-74 years) were analyzed. Tumors were localized in the middle third of the esophagus. One patient lived 15 months after surgery. Another is a case of early ACC who has been living 4.5 years after surgery and is without specific symptoms. The third patient had not had surgery and died 13 months after the onset of dysphagia. An autopsy showed only a locally invasive tumor growing into the surroundings of the esophagus, and regional lymph node metastases without distant parenchymal metastases. These findings support pathologic and biologic similarities between ACC of the esophagus and ACC of the salivary glands. There are synchronous tumors of the esophagus and the vital localization which makes the prognosis of ACC of the esophagus worse than ACC of the salivary glands.

text: One hundred percent oxygen reverses muscle hypoxia in a rat hindlimb model of acute arterial occlusion. Significant morbidity results from extremity ischemia after acute arterial occlusion. Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension.

text: A preliminary study of dye-enhanced laser photosclerosis. Laser ablation of veins after injection of wavelength-specific dyes to enhance and localize energy absorption could provide a useful adjunct to current treatment options. To enhance the absorption of diode laser energy at 808 nm, ear veins of 41 rabbits were infused with 2 to 3 ml of indocyanine green dye (maximum absorption, 805 nm) and exposed for 2 to 20 seconds. Animals were killed between 0 and 28 days after operation. Discrete time intervals of laser exposure exist during which various-sized vessels can be ablated without significant thermal injury to the overlying tissue. Small vessels (0.2 mm in diameter) blanch after 2 to 3 seconds of exposure, whereas medium-sized vessels (2 mm in diameter) require 8 to 10 seconds. Vessels can be ablated with a power density as low as 11.1 W/cm2. Specimens taken immediately after laser exposure show vessel wall thinning and a reirradiation effect, created as laser energy initially absorbed by dye is reemitted. By the seventh day after operation, a brisk inflammatory response and acanthosis of the overlying epidermal layer develop. The lumen is partially filled by thrombus with cellular invasion. By postoperative day 28, the epidermal thickening and inflammatory reaction have resolved; the vessel walls are fibrotic. The use of low-power, air-cooled diode lasers, in conjunction with wavelength-specific dyes, may provide a simple, viable, and cosmetically appealing alternative to the treatment of superficial varicosities of the extremities.

text: Abnormal growth patterns and adult short stature in 115 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia. Significant growth retardation was found in 115 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed their growth. These children were diagnosed before 12 years of age and treated on four protocols in a single institution; all received either cranial (n = 78) or craniospinal (n = 37) prophylactic irradiation. Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%. Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%. Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than.0001) in children who had earlier disease onset. Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases. Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights. These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention.

text: Application of 1 nm gold probes on paraffin wax sections for in situ hybridisation histochemistry. An in situ hybridisation technique that uses 1 nm immunogold reagents and silver enhancement was devised to detect biotinylated DNA viral probes in formalin fixed, paraffin wax sections of human cervix. DNA probes labelled with biotin-11-deoxyuridine triphosphate were detected after hybridisation to nucleic acid sequences by an antibiotin antibody, followed by a gold labelled secondary antibody. Silver enhancement then permitted visualisation of the signal at the light microscopic level. The method was reliable and produced less background staining than previously described methods. The signal could be enhanced by epi polarisation microscopy. Furthermore, biotinylated DNA probes may be detected directly by a 1 nm gold labelled goat antibiotin antibody without loss of labelling intensity, and this may be preferable to the longer two layer technique, previously described.

text: Use of recombinant human erythropoietin to enhance autologous blood donation in a patient with multiple red cell allo-antibodies and the anemia of chronic disease. We treated a patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, intractable pain from a defective hip prosthesis, and multiple red cell allo-antibodies with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) in order to facilitate collection of blood for autologous transfusion during an elective total hip revision. This patient had experienced a delayed transfusion reaction 4 months earlier after receiving least incompatible packed red cells for gastrointestinal bleeding. His blood could not be crossmatched because of the development of multiple antibodies to homologous blood given during previous surgery and several episodes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Following initiation of EPO therapy, there was a prompt and persistent increase in the reticulocyte count from a baseline of 1.6% to a maximum of 8.6%. This was accompanied by maintenance of the hematocrit between 32% and 38.5% despite withdrawal of seven units of autologous blood over the 45-day treatment period. Poor venous access and availability of blood bank personnel, not hematocrit level, were the limiting factors that determined how frequently blood could be collected. We conclude that EPO stimulated erythropoiesis in this patient with underlying anemia of chronic disease and facilitated harvest of autologous blood for elective surgery.

The antihypertensive efficacy, safety, and lipid effects of doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-inhibitor, were assessed in a general practice setting. Three hundred twenty-six patients were entered into the study, which involved three phases: (1) a 2-week baseline period, (2) an 8-week period in which patients received 1 to 8 mg of doxazosin once daily, and (3) a 4-week maintenance period. After 12 weeks, 78.8% of efficacy-evaluable patients were considered therapy successes (sitting diastolic blood pressure either less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline). The mean daily dose in patients considered a therapy success was 2.8 mg. By the final visit, sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressures of these patients were reduced by 16.4/13.5 mm Hg from a mean baseline of 170/106 mm Hg. The investigators' global assessment of efficacy of once-daily doxazosin therapy was excellent or good for 70% of patients. Of the 326 patients, 30.7% reported a total of 160 side effects; 78% of the side effects were mild or moderate in severity, and 24 patients (7.4%) discontinued treatment because of adverse experiences. The investigators' global assessment of toleration was excellent or good for 87% of patients. Doxazosin produced a significant decrease in total cholesterol (p = 0.02) and triglyceride (p less than 0.001) levels. From baseline to final visit there was also a highly significant reduction of 17% (p less than 0.001) in calculated risk score for coronary heart disease on the basis of the Framingham Heart Study risk equation.

text: Unconjugated bilirubin and cholesterol gallstone formation. Cholesterol gallstones usually have small amounts of pigment at their centers and often have diffuse pigmentation or pigmented layers alternating with cholesterol layers and/or pigmented rims associated with calcium carbonate (eggshell calcification). The pigments are primarily monomeric calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin anions and/or an insoluble, black, network polymer of tetrapyrroles. Bilirubin presumably can precipitate only if bile is supersaturated with calcium bilirubinates. Among various in vitro model systems, the aqueous solubilities and pK'a values for unconjugated bilirubin differ greatly. It is therefore not known whether normal bile is saturated with unconjugated bilirubin. However, all systems indicate that unconjugated bilirubin is solubilized by binding to bile salt monomers and oligomers, as well as micelles; marked metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin can occur in the presence of bile salt micelles, and both pK'a values of unconjugated bilirubin are greater than 6.0, probably because of internal hydrogen-bonding of the--COOH groups. Lecithin decreases equilibrium solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin crystals but enhances metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. Calcium ions form insoluble salts with unconjugated bilirubin monoanions and dianions but soluble complexes with bilirubin conjugates. The solubility products of the calcium bilirubinate salts suggest that normal hepatic bile is not saturated with CaB or Ca(HB)2 but that gallbladder bile may be supersaturated with Ca(HB)2.

We investigated the interrelationship of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in patients with untreated essential hypertension as compared to normotensive controls. The hypertensive subjects (n = 75; 43 men, 32 women) had a mean blood pressure of 138 +/- 8/95 +/- 5 mm Hg as compared with 120 +/- 11/80 +/- 8 in the normotensive group (n = 40; 22 men, 18 women). Serum PTH was measured with an intact molecule immunochemiluminometric assay and 1,25(OH)2D was measured with radioimmunoassay after HPLC separation. Hypertensive men had PTH levels that were 36% higher than normotensive men (5.3 +/- 2.9 v 3.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/L, P =.005). When blood pressure was analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a direct correlation between it and serum PTH in men (r =.31, P =.004). In women, by contrast, there was no difference in serum PTH between hypertensive and normotensive subjects and no relationship between blood pressure and the serum PTH concentration. Blood pressure was inversely correlated with serum phosphorus levels in both sexes (r = -0.20, P =.04). In men, the elevated serum PTH levels and depressed serum phosphorus levels would have predicted that serum 1,25(OH)2D would be higher in the hypertensive subjects. However, that was not observed, as serum 1,25(OH)2D was slightly lower in hypertensive (38.3 +/- 15.2 pg/mL) than normotensive men (42.7 +/- 11.3, P =.21).

text: Progressing cerebral infarction in relation to plasma glucose in gerbils. We studied neurologic morbidity and its evolution during hyperglycemia induced immediately after permanent unilateral common carotid artery ligation in Mongolian gerbils. A total of 60 animals were divided into five groups: one experiencing severe hyperglycemia for 1 hour after the onset of ischemia (brief hyperglycemia group, n = 13), a normoglycemic control group for the brief hyperglycemia group (n = 12), a group with severe hyperglycemia for 4 hours after the onset of ischemia (prolonged hyperglycemia group, n = 11), a normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 13), and a hyperosmolar normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 11). Neurologic morbidity and mortality were higher in the two hyperglycemic groups than in the three normoglycemic control groups. The neurologic deficit progressed according to the duration of severe hyperglycemia. In the three normoglycemic control groups neurologic status stabilized 120 minutes after the onset of ischemia, in the brief hyperglycemia group stabilization occurred at 210 minutes, and in the prolonged hyperglycemia group neurologic deficit progressed for approximately 360 minutes, coinciding with the death of all but one gerbil, in which the neurologic deficit remained stable until death 23 hours after ischemia. We suggest that hyperglycemia is another cause of progressing cerebral infarction.

text: Cystocerebral syndrome. Acute urinary retention presenting as confusion in elderly patients. The diagnosis of acute mental status changes in the elderly patient is often very difficult. Many causes are possible, and there is often little history obtainable. The physical examination occasionally provides the essential clues needed to discover the source of the sudden deterioration. We have recently evaluated four episodes of acute delirium in three elderly patients who presented with no readily apparent cause for these changes. On further evaluation, the patients were found to have marked bladder distention associated with acute urinary retention. None of these patients complained of discomfort, and none had any awareness or recollection of their deterioration. Each patient had rapid resolution of symptoms on bladder decompression. To our knowledge, this ""cystocerebral syndrome"" has not been previously described, and we suggest that it be considered in the evaluation of acute confusional states in elderly men.

text: Lugol stain for intraoperative determination of the proximal surgical margin of the esophagus. An adequate proximal surgical margin is difficult to determine particularly in cases of esophageal carcinoma with surrounding intraepithelial invasion. We report here readily facilitated intraoperative approaches for detection of the exact margin of carcinomatous invasion of the esophagus. The resected specimen of the esophagus is incised longitudinally and placed in a 1% Lugol bath for 2-3 minutes. The normal squamous epithelium includes glycogen that interacts with the iodine of Lugol's solution and the normal epithelium of the esophagus becomes a uniform greenish-brown. A squamous cell carcinoma does not include glycogen, hence is not stained with this solution and a clear identification is feasible. Thus, a carcinomatous infiltration not recognizable in routine examinations becomes macroscopically visible when Lugol's solution is used.

text: Coronary flow and mental stress. Experimental findings. The hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and coronary flow responses to a psychological test were studied in 13 pigs both in the absence (group 1, n = 8) and the presence (group 2, n = 5) of a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion.

text: The beta-type transforming growth factor. Mediators of cell regulation in the lung. An increased interest in the role of growth factors in the regulation of processes concerning normal and pathologic lung physiology has spurred a flurry of research in this area. Peptide growth factors are known to control not only cell proliferation but other events such as differentiation, chemotaxis, and matrix deposition as well. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family of regulatory peptides serves as a prime example to illustrate the multiplicity of effects elicited by peptide growth factors in various lung-derived cell types. At present, the TGF beta family consists of at least 17 proteins and, based on sequence analysis, they can be divided into two groups: a cluster that shows very high sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the closely related group, and a cluster that shows weaker sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the distantly related group. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the salient features of TGF beta structure and regulatory abilities of the closely related group. In addition, we will outline the evidence suggesting a role for TGF beta in normal lung development and physiology. Emphasis will be placed on studies with the closely related members TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 because, until recently, purified protein was available only for these two proteins.

text: Osteonecrosis of the knee after arthroscopic surgery: diagnosis with MR imaging. Spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee typically is a disease of the elderly characterized by an acute onset of pain. The exact cause of this condition has long been debated, although a causative relationship between meniscal tears and spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee has been postulated. Seven patients with knee pain, meniscal tears, and chondromalacia without initial evidence of osteonecrosis at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging underwent arthroscopic surgery with meniscal recontouring or repair and cartilage shaving. These patients returned within 2-14 months with recurrent pain in the treated knee. MR imaging then demonstrated abnormalities consistent with osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau may be a late sequela of meniscal injury in association with chondromalacia and arthroscopic surgery. This diagnosis should be suspected in patients with recurrent knee pain after arthroscopic repair of meniscal tears. The precise relationship of this pattern of osteonecrosis to that previously described as spontaneous requires further investigation.

text: A prospective study of acute central retinal artery obstruction. The incidence of secondary ocular neovascularization. We conducted a prospective study to determine the incidence of ocular neo-vascularization following acute central retinal artery obstruction. Only patients initially evaluated within 7 days of visual loss were eligible. Any patient with pre-existing ocular neovascularization or clinical evidence of the ocular ischemic syndrome noted at the initial evaluation was excluded. During the 18-month study, 33 consecutive patients were enrolled. Six patients subsequently developed neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 18.2%. In these six patients, neovascularization of the iris appeared as early as 12 days to as late as 15 weeks following the artery obstructions. Five of the six patients (15.2% of the total) later developed neovascular glaucoma. Another patient in this series developed neovascularization of the optic disc without neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 3.0%. Only two of the seven patients with ocular neovascularization had ipsilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease as determined by noninvasive carotid artery testing. This study confirms results of previous retrospective studies that the incidence of ocular neovascularization after central retinal artery obstruction is higher than commonly thought. It also shows that, in the majority of cases, carotid artery disease is not responsible for the neovascularization seen after central retinal artery obstruction.

text: Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome.

text: Atrial septal occlusion improves the accuracy of mitral valve area determination following percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy. We investigated the impact of the atrial communication on the mitral valve area calculation after percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy in 17 patients (15 women, 2 men; mean age 56 +/- 4 years). The hemodynamic measurements and mitral valve area calculations were performed with and without balloon occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site. The mitral valve area determined with balloon occlusion was significantly smaller than the mitral valve area determined without occlusion (1.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 cm2, P less than 0.01), and was similar to the echocardiographically determined valve area (1.6 +/- 0.1 cm2). This decrease in the calculated mitral valve area with occlusion was associated with a decrease in the measured cardiac output, without a change in the mitral valve gradient or the diastolic filling period. Occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site may permit more accurate determination of the mitral valve area and thus provide a better reference point for future comparison should the question or restenosis arise.

text: Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option.

text: Evaluating tooth eruption on sealant efficacy. For patients aged 5 to 9 and 11 to 14, 100 occlusal surfaces on newly erupting permanent molars were treated with a self-curing pit and fissure sealant. All teeth were categorized according to stage of eruption and sealant thickness of the coating applied. After 36 months, 75 surfaces were examined for a final evaluation; 52 surfaces (70%) did not need retreatment. Of the 23 surfaces retreated as a result of sealant loss or marginal deterioration, 18 were retreated only once in the six recall evaluations. Those molars treated originally with the operculum covering the distal marginal ridge of the occlusal surface had twice the probability for retreatment as teeth not treated until the entire marginal ridge was exposed. The thickness of the sealant coating did not affect the early signs of sealant failure.

text: Is adenosine 5'-triphosphate derangement or free-radical-mediated injury the major cause of ventricular dysfunction during reperfusion? Role of adenine nucleoside transport in myocardial reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to determine the dual role of ATP as an energy substrate and as a major source of oxygen-derived free-radical-mediated reperfusion injury by using adenine nucleoside blocker, p-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), and adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA). In a randomized study, 16 dogs were instrumented with minor-axis LTZ-piezoelectric crystals and intraventricular pressure transducers to monitor, off bypass, left ventricular performance by using a sensitive and load-independent index of contractility (slope of the stroke work-end-diastolic length relation). Hearts were subjected to 60 minutes of normothermic global ischemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion. Normal saline without (Group 1, n = 8) or with (Group 2, n = 8) NBMPR and EHNA was infused in three boluses into the cardiopulmonary bypass reservoir before ischemia and reperfusion. Transmural serial biopsies were obtained before and during ischemia and reperfusion and analyzed for myocardial adenine nucleotide pool intermediates by using high-performance liquid chromatography. In the control group, three hearts developed ischemic contracture and another three hearts exhibited cardiogenic shock during reperfusion. In the EHNA/NBMPR-treated group, left ventricular performance recovered within 30 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. control). Myocardial ATP was depleted to 20% of normal in both groups by the end of ischemia (p less than 0.05). Intramyocardial

text: Holter monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias in a randomised, controlled study of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias attributed to streptokinase treatment in acute myocardial infarction is not well defined. Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in 81 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to intravenous streptokinase 1.5 x 10(6) IU (n = 55) or placebo infusion (n = 26) 6.7 hours (mean) after the onset of symptoms. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. For the whole 24 hour period and during the first three hours after the start of treatment the incidence and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias were similar in the patients randomised to streptokinase and to placebo. But when the results in patients randomised ""early"" after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction were analysed separately the frequency of abnormal complexes, pairs, runs, and repetitive arrhythmias seemed to be higher in patients allocated to streptokinase. This may reflect arrhythmias associated with reperfusion.

text: Measles-associated diarrhea in hospitalized children in Lima, Peru: pathogenic agents and impact on growth. Because the causes of measles-associated diarrhea are not well known, 0- to 5-year-old children presenting to the hospital with measles-associated diarrhea (cases, n = 77) or acute diarrhea only (controls, n = 77) were compared. Growth and diarrheal morbidity were evaluated for 1 month after acute illness. Campylobacter jejuni was more frequently isolated from cases (31%) than controls (16%; P =.03). Rotavirus was absent in all cases versus 28% of controls (P less than.001). Incidence density for new episodes of diarrhea was significantly greater in cases (6.5 vs. 4.1; odds ratio, 1.6; confidence intervals, 1.09-2.34; P =.01), as was duration of episodes (3 vs. 2 days, P =.02). Both groups showed similar positive cumulative percentage weight gains throughout follow-up. These data support the theory of measles as a risk factor for developing diarrhea. The bacteriologic and virologic findings may reflect the immunologic response of the host to measles infection.

text: Lymphomas of the breast. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of primary and secondary cases. Primary mammary lymphoma is rare, and little is known about the immunophenotype of such cases. The authors studied both primary and secondary breast lymphomas with a broad panel of T- and B-cell markers using paraffin-embedded tissue and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Cases of primary B-cell lymphoma were further tested to determine light and heavy chain type. Thirty-five cases were analyzed, including 16 primary lymphomas. Diffuse large cell lymphoma was present in ten of 16 primary and 14 of 18 secondary cases. Lymphoepithelial lesions in ducts and lobules and frequent vascular involvement were found in both primary and secondary cases. Immunohistochemistry studies on 13 tumors revealed all of the primary tumors to be B-cell in origin, except for one case of primary T-cell lymphoma; to the authors' knowledge, this represents the first description of this entity. Fifteen of 17 secondary tumors exhibited B-cell markers and one of 17 exhibited T-cell markers; in only one case could lineage not be determined. Among primary B-cell cases, IgM was found to be the most frequent heavy chain type; IgA reactivity was found in only one case. Survival was related to stage and histologic characteristics; patients with Stage II disease and higher grade histologic lesions had a worse prognosis. Half of the patients with primary lymphoma have had recurrent disease. Although local recurrences were observed, the authors also saw a tendency for recurrence in other extranodal sites. The authors conclude that, although primary lymphoma of the breast is compatible with long-term survival, a significant number of patients eventually die of their disease. As with other extranodal lymphomas, survival rate appears most related to stage of disease. Also, the vast majority of primary tumors are B-cell in

text: Effects of site-directed mutagenesis at residues cysteine-31 and cysteine-184 on lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity. Native lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase; phosphatidylcholine:sterol O-acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.43) protein, and LCAT in which either or both of the enzyme free cysteines had been replaced with glycine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, has been expressed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human LCAT gene. The mass of LCAT secreted, determined by immunoassay, did not differ in the native and mutant species. LCAT specific activity was also unchanged in the mutant species. In particular, the cysteine-free double mutant, in which Cys-31 and Cys-184 had both been replaced, was fully active in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters. This result is not consistent with a catalytic role for LCAT free cysteine residues. The classical inhibitor of LCAT activity, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which strongly (89%) inhibited the native enzyme, had partial (45%) inhibitory activity with mutant enzyme species containing a single -SH residue, while the double mutant was not significantly inhibited by DTNB. These data are interpreted to suggest that Cys-31 and Cys-184 are vicinal both to each other and to the ""interfacial binding site"" at residues 177-182, and that DTNB exerts its effect by steric inhibition.

text: Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons. Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone. Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing. Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period. Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing. Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months. Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory. For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect. Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors.

Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed. Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%). Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication. A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication. In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty. A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion. Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty.

text: The epidemiologic necropsy for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The epidemiologic necropsy measures the occurrence of unsuspected disease through the examination of necropsy records. The estimates of unsuspected disease should approximate what occurs in the living population. The necropsy records of the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City) from 1950 to 1984 were examined for the occurrence rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Each adult patient was categorized as (1) without abdominal aortic aneurysm, (2) abdominal aortic aneurysm discovered as a necropsy surprise, or (3) abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed or suspected during life. Necropsy detection rates of unsuspected abdominal aortic aneurysms were compared with those found in five published screening surveys. The necropsy detection rate in men was 81 (0.019) of 4155 and was 28 (0.009) of 3142 in women, a difference that was statistically significant. When the necropsy series was adjusted to reflect the same demographic composition as the screening surveys, the results from necropsy and screening were statistically similar. In particular, two surveys from the United Kingdom showed screening detection rates among white men of 0.072 compared with a necropsy detection rate of 0.058. These results further support the use of the epidemiologic necropsy as a research tool for estimating the reservoir of disease in the population.

text: Long-term follow-up in patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen patients with coronary artery disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or no organic heart disease who presented with incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT) were studied and followed for a mean period of 51 +/- 35 months. In these patients the incessant VT included greater than or equal to 3 episodes of sustained VT at a rate of greater than or equal to 120 beats/min and frequent episodes of nonsustained VT over a 24-hour period. No patient had electrolyte disorder, prolonged QT interval, drug-induced arrhythmia or myocardial infarction less than 2 weeks old. Six patients died within 27 months of follow-up; 4 from sudden death and 2 from acute myocardial infarction. Three of the 11 surviving patients had remission of their VT within 1 week after the diagnosis of incessant VT. In 3 other patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued during follow-up because of adverse effects of the drugs or other medical reasons, 2 were found in remission. In the remaining 5 alive patients, deliberate attempts were made to discontinue the antiarrhythmic drugs; 4 of these patients were found in remission when the drugs were discontinued. Thus, 9 of these patients (53%) with incessant VT had remission over a mean follow-up of 55 +/- 34 months after discontinuation of the antiarrhythmic drugs. The probability of remission in patients surviving incessant VT warrants trials of discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs in these patients.

text: Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations were measured at multiple sites in the explanted heart in four patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. Patients were taking amiodarone, 200 to 400 mg/day (mean 300 +/- 115), for 88 to 428 days (mean 229 +/- 148). The mean cumulative dose was 58 +/- 21.3 g. Plasma amiodarone concentration in three subjects was 204, 312 and 419 ng/ml and desethylamiodarone concentration was 268, 513 and 880 ng/ml, respectively. Significant interindividual variability in myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone was observed (p less than 0.05). Mean myocardial amiodarone concentration ranged from 4 +/- 1.0 to 29 +/- 17.2 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05); mean desethylamiodarone concentration ranged from 22 +/- 8.8 to 141 +/- 102.5 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05). At each site, save for fat, myocardial desethylamiodarone concentration was higher than amiodarone concentration. Greater intraindividual variability was observed in myocardial desethylamiodarone compared with amiodarone concentration particularly in septal and scar tissue (p = NS). No significant relation was found between myocardial concentration and duration of treatment. In patients with significant ventricular disease, usefulness of plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentration to estimate myocardial concentration is limited by intra- and interindividual variability.

text: Involvement of sodium in the protective effect of 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride on ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated rat ventricular wall. During reperfusion in the isolated right ventricular wall of the rat after 60 min of ischemia, developed tension and resting tension were 35 +/- 4 and 221 +/- 12%, respectively, of preischemic values. Including 35 microM ouabain in the perfusate before and after ischemia resulted in more severe cardiac dysfunction during reperfusion than in drug-untreated hearts. Introduction of the Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), could effectively protect the right ventricular wall against ischemia-reperfusion dysfunction in the presence or absence of ouabain. The ion content in the right ventricular wall was measured with atomic absorbance spectrophotometry. Before ischemia, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 53.4 +/- 6.4, 2.70 +/- 0.22 and 262 +/- 7.7 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively. After 60 min of ischemia and 6 min of reperfusion, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 73.4 +/- 7.2, 3.79 +/- 0.31 and 180 +/- 15 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively (P less than.05). Introduction of 20 microM DMA normalized ion content in the muscles which was consistent with the contractile function recovery during reperfusion. The data suggest that a rise in intracellular Na+ in the early stage of reperfusion represents a crucial or primary step for the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction. DMA, which protects against severe reperfusion-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, appears to act via a normalization of tissue sodium levels. This action is consistent with its proposed role as a blocker of transsarcolemmal Na(+)-H+ exchange.

Compared with the normal subjects, patients demonstrates severe exercise intolerance with a 48% reduction in peak oxygen consumption (11.6 +/- 4.0 versus 22.7 +/- 6.1 ml/kg per min; p less than 0.001), primarily due to a 41% reduction in peak cardiac index (4.2 +/- 1.4 versus 7.1 +/- 1.1 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.001). In patients compared with normal subjects, peak left ventricular stroke volume index (34 +/- 9 versus 46 +/- 7 ml/min per m2; p less than 0.01) and end-diastolic volume index (56 +/- 14 versus 68 +/- 12 ml/min per m2; p less than 0.08) were reduced, whereas peak ejection fraction and end-systolic volume index were not different. In patients, the change in end-diastolic volume index during exercise correlated strongly with the change in stroke volume index (r = 0.97; p less than 0.0001) and cardiac index (r = 0.80; p less than 0.03). Pulmonary wedge pressure was markedly increased at peak exercise in patients compared with normal subjects (25.7 +/- 9.1 versus 7.1 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001). Patients demonstrated a shift of the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-volume relation upward and to the left at rest. Increases in left ventricular filling pressure during exercise were not accompanied by increases in end-diastolic volume, indicating a limitation to left ventricular filling.

text: Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with the inflatable expander: a critical appraisal. Breast reconstruction using inflatable expanders has become an established and preferred technique. Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique. In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken. Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications. In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process. Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved.

text: The t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene to a novel transcribed locus. Retinoic acid is a vitamin A derivative with striking effects on development and cell differentiation. Several nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), acting as ligand-inducible transcription factors, have been characterized and indirect evidence suggests that they have distinct roles. One of the most intriguing properties of retinoic acid is its ability to induce in vivo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells into mature granulocytes, leading to morphological complete remissions. Because the RAR alpha gene maps to chromosome 17q21 (ref. 14), close to the t(15;17) (q21-q11-22) translocation specifically associated with APL, we analysed RAR alpha gene structure and expression in APL cells. We report here that, in one APL-derived cell line, the RAR alpha gene has been translocated to a locus, myl, on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of a myl/RAR alpha fusion messenger RNA. Using two probes located on either side of the cloned breakpoint, we have found genomic rearrangements of one or other locus in six patients out of eight, demonstrating that the RAR alpha and/or myl genes are frequently rearranged in APL and the breakpoints are clustered. These findings strongly implicate retinoic acid receptor alpha in leukaemogenesis.

text: Renal protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Renal dysfunction and hypertension are closely associated. Hypertension causes approximately 25% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and develops in virtually every patient with advanced renal insufficiency from any cause. Although normalization of blood pressure can reduce mortality from uremia and ameliorate the progression of renal impairment in patients with established renal insufficiency from hypertension and diabetes, antihypertensive therapy alone is not totally effective in preventing progressive compromise of renal function--especially in blacks and diabetics, who are at high risk for developing ESRD. Of particular promise is the rapidly increasing understanding of the intrarenal autocrine and paracrine functions of angiotensin II produced locally by a tissue renin-angiotensin system. Consistent and convincing experimental data have demonstrated that angiotensin II plays many roles in the control of renal function and the kidney's response to injury. The intrarenal effects of angiotensin II include: 1) increase in the efferent arteriolar tone, resulting in increased glomerular capillary pressure, 2) promotion of mesangial cell contraction, 3) stimulation of proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption, and 4) possible growth hormone effects leading to hypertrophy or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle. Because of their favorable intrarenal hemodynamic effects (particularly reduction of glomerular capillary pressure), ACE inhibitors may provide a renal protective effect in addition to their systemic antihypertensive effects. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of renal insufficiency in hypertensives and diabetics are currently under way. Favorable results could lead to a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.

We have established a rapidly proliferating T-cell line from the peripheral blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome, which expresses a mature helper T-cell phenotype and contains cytogenetic abnormalities and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements identical to those in the patient's blood. The method of establishment and characteristics of this line are described.

text: Breast cancer during pregnancy and lactation. Breast cancer is the most frequently seen cancer in pregnancy and lactation, but the incidence is low, the disease being seen in approximately 0.03% of pregnancies. Only 1% to 2% of breast cancer overall is diagnosed during pregnancy or lactation. There is no evidence to implicate pregnancy or lactation in either the etiology or the progression of breast cancer. Careful breast examination early in the pregnancy is very important to find solid masses that require biopsy before breast engorgement hides them. Therapeutic options vary, depending on the stage of disease and the stage of the pregnancy. Operable disease in the first 6 to 7 months of the pregnancy should be treated by mastectomy, as irradiation is contraindicated. Late in the pregnancy, a lumpectomy and axillary dissection can be done, with irradiation being delayed until after delivery. General anesthesia is safe if the usual precautions are taken to compensate for the physiologic changes induced by pregnancy. Unfortunately, delay in diagnosis is common, and 70% to 89% of patients with operable primary lesions have positive axillary lymph nodes. Late stage appears to be the only reason for the generally worse prognosis in these patients, as stage for stage, they have a course similar to that of nonpregnant patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered late in the pregnancy but should usually be delayed until after delivery. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer diagnosed early in the pregnancy, for whom both chemotherapy and radiation therapy would normally be recommended, consideration must be given to termination of the pregnancy. There is no evidence that termination of pregnancy improves the outlook for the patients, but it does permit standard aggressive therapy in advanced disease.

text: Localization of 3H-dihydroergotamine-binding sites in the cat central nervous system: relevance to migraine. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is the treatment of choice in aborting the acute attack of migraine. Although its efficacy has been known for 40 years, its mechanism of action is still disputed. Data regarding the site of action of dihydroergotamine may provide an insight into its mechanism of action and thus identify a locus of potentially abnormal pathophysiology in migraine. By using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic techniques, the localization of specific binding sites for 3H-dihydroergotamine in the cat brain has been examined. Binding was seen in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord, in the medulla, associated with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema, and descending spinal trigeminal nucleus, and in the mesencephalon and the cerebral cortex. The highest density of binding sites was found in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei of the midbrain. Furthermore, these same brain regions were also labeled after intravenous administration of 3H-dihydroergotamine. It is important that the brain areas specifically labeled are key nuclei involved in cranial pain transmission, suggesting that dihydroergotamine may act at these central sites in migraine.

text: Surgical correction of the snapping iliopsoas tendon. Eighteen patients with 20 symptomatic hips underwent lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon for persistent painful snapping of this ""internal"" variety of snapping hip. We referred to the pathologic, painful snapping of the iliopsoas in the deep anterior groin as the ""internal"" snapping hip. This is in contrast to the more common and better-known ""external"" snapping that involves the greater trochanter and its overlying soft tissues. The results of our iliopsoas lengthening procedure are presented here. Lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon was accomplished by step cutting of the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas. The pathoanatomy of this poorly understood symptom complex was described in 1984 paper from this institution and is reviewed here. Iliopsoas bursography demonstrated a sudden jerking movement of the iliopsoas tendon between the anterior inferior iliac spine and iliopectineal eminence, synchronous with the patient's pain and often accompanied by an audible snap. The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 2.9 years, and the average length of postoperative followup was 25 months. All patients, except one, had a marked reduction in the frequency of snapping after tendon lengthening, and 14 of 20 hips had no snapping postoperatively. Of the six patients who had recurrence of snapping, all but one stated that this occurred much less frequently and was much less painful compared to the preoperative state. Two hips required reoperation. Postoperatively, only three patients complained of subjective weakness, and most patients were unlimited in physical activity with return to activities such as competitive football, pole vaulting, and long-distance running.

text: Thallous chloride uptake and DNA profile in parathyroid adenomas. Thallium isotope scintigraphy is used to localize parathyroid adenomas but the mechanism underlying the technique is poorly understood. While larger adenomas are reliably localized the results are less certain for small tumours. This study explores the relationship between cellular DNA profile and thallium uptake (localization accuracy) in 24 parathyroid adenomas. The DNA profile was assessed using flow cytometry and standard subtraction thallium scintigraphy was performed before surgery. Fifteen of the 24 adenomas demonstrated excessive mitotic activity and 13 of these glands were accurately localized. Of the remaining nine glands, only five were localized accurately (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test including Yates' correction). This difference in thallium uptake could not be accounted for on the basis of gland weight. Thallium localization of parathyroid adenomas is related to mitotic activity. This may explain some of the limitations of this technique.

text: Effect of fibrin sealant on the healing colonic anastomosis in the rat. Fibrin adhesives have been advocated as a protective seal in colonic anastomosis to prevent leakage. In order to assess the effect of fibrin glue sealing we compared the healing of sutured colonic anastomosis in the rat (group 1) with the addition of human-derived fibrin sealant (group 2). As a control for a possible reaction to foreign protein, in group 3 the sutured anastomosis was sealed with specially prepared rat fibrin adhesive. On days 2, 4 and 7, ten animals in each group were killed. Adhesion formation was scored and the in situ bursting pressure was measured. The collagen concentration and degradation were estimated by measuring hydroxyproline. Adhesion formation was significantly increased in groups 2 and 3 compared with the control group. On days 2 and 7 the bursting pressure was not different between the groups. On day 4 the bursting pressure in groups 2 and 3 was significantly lower than in group 1 (P less than 0.001). These findings correspond with the results of collagen measurements. On day 4 the concentration of hydroxyproline was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3. Histological examination showed infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes into the sealant on days 2 and 4; on day 7 the sealant had vanished. From these results it is concluded that fibrin sealing of the colonic anastomosis in the rat does not improve healing, as demonstrated by bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentration. On the contrary, it seems to have a negative influence.

text: Thyroglobulin level as a predictive factor of tumoral recurrence in differentiated thyroid cancer. Ninety-eight patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied. Actuarial methods were used to investigate the 10-yr probability of survival (pS) and disease-free survival (pDFS). Our results show that the pDFS is a function of: (1) clinicopathologic stage: Stages I-II, pDFS = 90.9% +/- 5.0% versus Stages III-IV, pDFS = 55.9% +/- 17.8% (p less than 0.005); (2) age: Age less than 45 yr, pDFS = 87.2% +/- 10.0% versus age greater than or equal to 45 yr, pDFS = 66.6% +/- 12.0% (p less than 0.002); and (3) plasma thyroglobulin (Tg) levels: Tg less than or equal to 23 ng/ml, pDFS = 100% versus Tg greater than 23 ng/ml, pDFS = 68.3% +/- 10.6% (p less than 0.005). Using the multivariate analysis of proportional risk, the regression coefficients obtained (Stage: beta = 0.7615; Age: beta = 1.6398, and Tg: beta = 1.7607) allowed us to establish two different groups of risk of relapse on the basis of a prognostic index.

text: The placebo effect in heart failure. Many patients who are enrolled in controlled clinical trials of new drugs for the treatment of heart failure show favorable hemodynamic and clinical responses to placebo therapy. This ""placebo effect"" results from both the creation of a supportive therapeutic environment and the spontaneous improvement that is commonly seen when measurements of symptoms and cardiac function are repeated frequently over long intervals of time. Three months of treatment with a placebo produces a reduction in symptoms in 25% to 35% of patients, an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure, and an increase in exercise tolerance of up to 90 to 120 seconds. Physicians commonly seek to maximize the ""placebo effect,"" since the goal of treatment in the clinical setting is to improve the quality of the patient's life. On the other hand, clinical investigators seek to minimize the ""placebo effect,"" since the goal of a research study is to test the hypothesis that the new drug is superior to a placebo.

text: Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension. Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05). All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension. Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition.

text: A multifaced DNA ploidy analysis to determine ovarian carcinoma aggressiveness. A microfluorometric DNA study was conducted on isolated cells from 64 fragments of ovarian epithelial tumors. Data analysis considered the DNA content of the main stemline and the prevalence of cells in the different compartments of the DNA ploidy histogram in relation to the mitotic activity index and the histologic architecture. Main stemlines were found remarkably stable in different parts of the same tumor. Peridiploid (1.8c to 2.2c) stemlines were found both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated tumors. However, low aneuploid (2.2c to 3.0c) stemlines were mostly found in nonsolid tumors and high ploidy (3.2 to 5.04 c) stemlines were prevalent in solid tumors. A comparative analysis between DNA ploidy parameters and mitotic activity was useful to evaluate the expanding modalities of neoplastic cell populations. This analysis revealed that several tumors accumulate an excessive amount of heteroploid cells and others an excessive amount of G2 cells. Yet, most neoplastic cell populations vary from slow to rapidly growing patterns without relevant abnormalities in their ploidy graphic profiles. No relationship was found between stemline ploidy and histologic architecture compared with expanding modalities. These findings indicate that multifaced criteria combining features such as main ploidy, graphic profile, mitotic rate, and histologic architecture measured on one or more microsamples of the same tumor may help to objectively estimate the aggressiveness reached by the neoplastic cells at the time of clinical presentation.

text: The effects of tumor necrosis factor on intestinal structure and metabolism. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a polypeptide produced predominantly by activated macrophages, is an important mediator of sepsis. We analyzed the specific metabolic changes that occur in the gut following TNF administration. Following general anesthesia, hemodynamic and metabolic indices were measured serially in control dogs (n = 7) and animals receiving a continuous sublethal intravenous infusion of TNF (0.57.10(5) IU/kg/6 hours, n = 7). During TNF infusion mean arterial pressure gradually decreased despite fluid administration, which maintained wedge pressure and cardiac index, which were similar to control animals. While TNF significantly reduced intestinal blood flow to 12 +/- 3 mL/min/kg compared to 28 +/- 3 mL/min/kg (p less than 0.01) in controls, intestinal oxygen consumption was maintained due to an increased extraction rate. Despite hypoperfusion the intestinal exchange of metabolic substrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) was comparable between the control and TNF-infused animals. However, when substrate carbon balance across the intestinal tract was calculated, it appeared that there was a limitation in fuel availability in the TNF animals. This may be due to competition for fuel between the gut and other major organs. Fuel limitation may jeopardize rapid cell proliferation and mucosal repair and with regional hypoperfusion these processes may account for the mucosal ulcerations observed at the termination of the study.

text: Platelet factor 4 mRNA expression in cells from a patient with megakaryoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. A 61-year-old man with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia developed megakaryoblastic leukemia. In the blast phase, his blast cells showed undifferentiated megakaryoblastic characteristics with no alpha-granules or demarcation membranes but with detectable platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity and surface glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. The patient has remained reasonably well for at least 12 months after blastic crisis, and 6-mercaptopurine alone has been effective in controlling leukocytosis and megakaryoblast proliferation. The expression of mRNA for platelet-specific proteins, such as GPIIb and platelet factor 4 (PF4), was studied in the patient's blast cells by the Northern blot analysis. Both GPIIb and PF4 mRNA were detected in the blast cells. Cytoplasmic maturation occurs later than the synthesis of the surface GP during megakaryocyte maturation. Therefore, PF4 mRNA expression should be a marker of mature megakaryoblasts. The PF4 mRNA expression in megakaryoblastic leukemia may indicate that a patient will have long survival and a good response to chemotherapy.

text: Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia.

text: Escherichia coli in patients with renal scarring: genotype and phenotype of Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-, Forssman- and mannose-specific adhesins. The frequency of Escherichia coli with Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-specific adhesins is reduced among children who develop renal scars. The adhesion-negative phenotype may be due to the absence of the pap DNA sequences which encode these adhesins or to a phase variation event induced by in vitro culture. In the present study the frequency of pap and pil homologous DNA was determined by dot blot analysis with probes specific for the respective sequence using E. coli strains from children with recurrent pyelonephritis with and without renal scarring. The frequency of pap was 79% in the strains isolated from the nonscarring group compared with 39% in the strains from the scarring group (P less than 0.001). The Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta phenotype was expressed by 89% of the pap-positive strains from the nonscarring group compared with 71% in the scarring group (P less than 0.05). In addition 13 of 77 of the pap-positive E. coli strains agglutinated sheep erythrocytes but not the Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta latex beads; a reaction attributed to reactivity with the Forssman glycolipid. DNA sequences homologous with pil were found in 95% of all strains and there was no significant difference between the nonscarring and the scarring groups. The low frequency of Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta specific strains in the scarring group was therefore due to the absence of pap-homologous DNA sequences and to a reduced rate of phenotypic expression among pap-positive scarring strains. There was no support for a relationship between type 1 fimbriae and renal scarring.

text: Relationship between lung asbestos fiber type and concentration and relative risk of mesothelioma. A case-control study. Lung tissue from 221 definite and probable cases of malignant mesothelioma reported to the Australian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program from January 1980 through December 1985 and from an age-sex frequency matched control series of 359 postmortem cases were examined by light microscopic (LM) and analytical transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX). Concentrations of total fibers (coated and uncoated) (LM), crocidolite, amosite, chrysotile, and unidentified amphibole (TEM) (fibers/g dry lung tissue) were measured. Fiber concentrations less than 10 microns in length and greater than or equal to 10 microns in length were separately quantified. By comparing cases (221) and controls (359 LM, 103 TEM), odds ratios for increasing fiber concentrations compared with less than 15,000 fibers/g (LM) and less than 200,000 fibers/g (TEM) (the respective detection limits) were calculated. Univariate analyses showed statistically significant dose-response relationships between odds ratio and fiber concentration for all fiber concentration measures. The relationship between log(odds ratio) and log(fiber concentration) was linear. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, amosite less than 10 microns, and chrysotile less than 10 microns as explanatory variables best described the data. The odds ratios for a X10 increase in fiber concentration (fibers/micrograms) were as follows: crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, 29.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 241); chrysotile less than 10 microns, 15.7 (95% CI, 6.1 to 40); amosite less than 10 microns,

One hundred fifty-five consecutive patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation by a physician-manned advanced life support unit were randomly assigned to receive nimodipine or placebo at a dosage of 10 micrograms/kg as an intravenous injection immediately after restoration of spontaneous circulation, followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg per minute for 24 hours. No significant difference was found in the 1-year survival rate of nimodipine-treated (30 [40%] of 75 patients) and placebo-treated patients (29 [36%] of 80 patients). Recurrent ventricular fibrillation during the treatment occurred in one patient in the nimodipine group compared with 12 patients in the placebo group. In a post hoc analysis of patients with very long delays in advanced life support (more than 10 minutes), the 1-year survival rate was higher with nimodipine (eight [47%] of 17 patients) than with placebo (two [8%] of 26 patients).

text: Diagnosis of recent myocardial infarction with quantitative backscatter imaging: preliminary studies. Acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction may be recognized with ultrasound tissue characterization techniques because of myocardial acoustic changes caused by reduced perfusion and/or collagen deposition. Our purpose was to study the acoustic properties of recent myocardial infarction when the predominating pathologic finding was myocardial edema and leukocytic infiltration. We used a new quantitative backscatter imaging system to study 18 patients 9 +/- 5 days after myocardial infarction (eight patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction and 10 with inferior myocardial infarction) and 20 normal subjects. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter (end-diastolic minus end-systolic) was calculated from on-line measurements. Standard parasternal long- and short-axis and apical four- and two-chamber views were obtained. In the anteroseptal myocardial infarction group, the cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter was lower in the septum (1.5 +/- 1.6 dB) than in the posteroinferior wall (3.2 +/- 1.2 dB); however, the sample size of only three patients (of eight patients imaged) in the latter group prevented statistical comparison. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter in the infarcted septum was less than the measurement obtained in the septum of the control group (4.3 +/- 2.4 dB, p less than 0.05). In the inferior infarction group, the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in the posteroinferior wall (1.8 +/- 1.7 dB) was not significantly different from the measurement obtained in the septum (3.7 +/- 3.6 dB); however, the cyclic variation in the posteroinferior

Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding.

text: Utility of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain. The diagnostic yield of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing was assessed in 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for non-cardiac chest pain. Manometric studies revealed the nutcracker esophagus in 21 patients; non-specific esophageal motility disorders in 19 patients; a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter in 4 patients; diffuse esophageal spasm in 2 patients; and normal motility in 54 patients. Endoscopy was normal in 38 patients; but revealed grades II to IV esophagitis in 24 patients; gastritis and/or duodenitis in 18 patients; a sliding hiatal hernia without evidence of esophagitis in 14 patients; and gastric or duodenal ulcers in 6 patients. Twenty-five individuals were found to have normal manometric studies in combination with a negative Bernstein test. Among these 25 patients, however, 7 patients had esophagitis (grade II or higher); 6 patients had gastritis and/or duodenitis; five patients had a sliding hiatal hernia without esophagitis; 1 patient had peptic ulcer disease; and only 6 patients had a normal endoscopic exam. Our results indicate that endoscopy can identify a significant number of patients with acid-peptic disease who present with non-cardiac chest pain, that would not have been otherwise diagnosed by esophageal manometry or Bernstein testing alone or in combination.

text: Effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with angina pectoris and heart failure The effects of captopril and placebo were compared in 18 patients with chronic heart failure and angina pectoris with use of a double-blind crossover trial design. Symptoms were assessed by patient treatment preference, visual analogue scores and nitroglycerin consumption. Exercise performance was assessed using two different treadmill protocols of different work intensity with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and by supine bicycle exercise and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography. Arrhythmias were assessed by 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients generally preferred placebo to captopril, and this appeared to be due to an increase in symptoms of angina with captopril. Treadmill exercise time on a high intensity protocol was shorter with captopril than with placebo; on a low intensity protocol, angina became a more frequent limiting symptom even though overall exercise performance was not changed. The heart rate-blood pressure product was reduced, but largely because of a reduction in blood pressure rather than in heart rate. During supine bicycle exercise, no differences in symptoms, exercise performance, ejection fraction or changes in blood pressure were noted and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced. Captopril does not appear to be clinically useful in alleviating angina pectoris in patients with heart failure, and this effect may be related to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure. Nonetheless, desirable metabolic effects, a reduction in arrhythmias and potential effects on survival require further study of captopril in patients with both angina and heart failure.

text: Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation. Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the ""tachycardia-related"" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents ""backwash"" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation.

text: The combined use of apraclonidine and pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. Early postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) rise is a frequent and vision-threatening complication of laser surgery for glaucoma. Recent studies show that apraclonidine, a new alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, can reduce the incidence of this problem. In a randomized, double-masked prospective study, we explored the efficacy of apraclonidine combined with pilocarpine during laser iridotomy in a Hispanic population. A significantly lower early postoperative IOP with less frequent severe pressure spikes occurred in the apraclonidine-treated patients. The addition of pilocarpine did not interfere with the beneficial effect of this medication. Of particular interest was the fact that chronic angle-closure glaucoma was the diagnosis in all patients who had a significant postoperative IOP rise in this study.

text: Comparison of frequency of late potentials in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with advanced congestive heart failure and their usefulness in predicting sudden death. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were obtained in 62 consecutive patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing evaluation for possible heart transplantation to determine if late potentials: (1) provide unique information compared to assessment of ventricular ectopic activity on ambulatory electrocardiogram, and (2) identify a subgroup of CHF patients with higher sudden death risk. Patients with a history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia were excluded. CHF was due to old myocardial infarction in 40 patients and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 22 patients. Late potentials were present in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with old infarction but in only 3 of 22 (14%) patients with nonischemic CHF (p = 0.03). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained in 34 patients (55%). Total ventricular ectopic activity and repetitive forms of ectopy were similar in patients with and without late potentials. Nine patients died suddenly, 9 had nonsudden death, 15 underwent heart transplantation and 29 were alive and well after a mean follow-up of 218 +/- 154 days. At 1 year, the actuarial risk of death was 37% and of sudden death was 20%. Sudden death risk was 12% in patients with late potentials versus 21% in those without (p = 0.73). Thus, the incidence of the arrhythmia substrate producing late potentials depends on the CHF etiology. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiogram provide independent information for possible risk assessment in CHF. However, late potentials are poor predictors of sudden death risk when CHF is advanced, possibly due to the heterogeneity of causes of sudden death--ventricular tachycardia being only 1 of many possible mechanisms.

text: Ischemic optic neuropathy. ION typically affects the older population with a sudden decrease in vision, altitudinal visual field loss, and a swollen optic nervehead. Systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most commonly associated medical problems. Occlusion of the posterior ciliary arterial blood supply to the retrolaminar optic nerve leads to axoplasmic stasis and further compromise of vessels in the nerve substance, which causes the typical funduscopic appearance. Although there is no recognized medical treatment that can reverse the visual loss, a recent report suggests optic nerve sheath decompression for a select group of patients with a gradual decline in vision due to ION may be beneficial. When ION occurs in persons less than 50 years of age, such etiologies as juvenile diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid antibody-associated clotting disorders, collagen-vascular disease, and migraines should be considered. Rarely, complications of intraocular surgery or acute blood loss may cause an ischemic event in the optic nerve.

text: Effectiveness of periodic checkup by ultrasonography for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Periodic checkup by ultrasonography was conducted on patients with chronic liver diseases for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 19 months, a total of 2004 examinations were performed on a total of 660 cases (179 cases with liver cirrhosis in the compensatory stage, younger than 70 years; 481 cases with chronic hepatitis, aged 40 to 70 years for men and 50 to 70 years for women). Of the 660 cases, 22 HCC cases (3.3%) were detected and finally diagnosed by angiography and/or histologic examination. Four of those cases (18%) had a single nodule smaller than 1 cm in diameter, and 11 cases (50%) had a single nodule smaller than 2 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 12 cases (55%). In comparison with the control group (83 HCC cases not receiving any periodic checkup), the frequency of small liver cancer and the surgical resection rate in the study group were significantly higher. This examination system by periodic ultrasonography checkup of patients with chronic hepatic diseases was effective for early detection and permitted aggressive therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.

text: Diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) as a putative cause of diarrhea in Mayan children in Mexico. Diarrhea is a major cause of infantile morbidity and mortality in developing countries. A community-based, case control study was conducted in a southern Mexican Mayan village for 3 weeks during the peak diarrhea period to prospectively identify the infectious agents associated with childhood diarrheal disease. Several enteropathogens were isolated from stools of 34 of 58 cases, although none was significantly associated with diarrhea. For the 24 cases from which no enteropathogens were isolated, diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) strains were significantly associated with diarrheal disease (P less than.02; odds ratio = 6; 95% confidence limit, 1.08-99.0). DAEC were highly heterogeneous with respect to plasmid content and serotype. Three DNA probes designed to differentiate E. coli exhibiting localized, diffuse, or aggregative adherence were compared with results from a standard HeLa cell binding assay to assess the utility of these probes in the field. This study provides evidence for the potential pathogenic capacity of DAEC and underscores the variety of diarrheal agents operating within a community.

text: Bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis versus karyotype in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia. Karyotype and bcr/abl recombinant DNA analyses are two means of detecting the chromosomal aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia. The authors compared these two methods in a retrospective study of 36 patients with CML in which they found the bcr/abl DNA recombinant event in 100% (29 of 29) of those patients who had the Philadelphia chromosome. To achieve this sensitivity, a battery of two bcr probes and three restriction enzymes is necessary. The authors propose a sequential algorithm for efficient use of these probes and enzymes. In 76% of the patients, bcr/abl rearrangement can be detected with a Bgl II digest and a 3' commercial probe. An additional 21% of patients can be detected by a second assay in which the same membrane is rehybridized to a 3' and 5' combination bcr probe. One patient (3%) required an additional restriction enzyme digest with BamH I to detect the recombinant event by the same 3' probe. Karyotype analysis is used to determine cytogenetic remission in patients with CML under therapy. The authors studied the use of DNA analysis by the Southern blot technique to detect a decrease in the relative number of leukemic cells. By dilution studies and densitometric scanning of autoradiographs, the authors were able to detect a 15% decrease in the relative number of cells having the bcr/abl recombinant event. The authors report the preliminary results of three patients in whom they compared the karyotype and recombinant DNA analysis at multiple time points in their clinical course. In conclusion, the bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis is superior to karyotype for the diagnosis of CML and can be used for monitoring treated patients.

text: Primary central nervous system lymphoma in patients with and without the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A retrospective analysis and review of the literature. Twenty-two cases of PCL were reviewed, in which 9 patients had AIDS and 13 did not. A review of the literature identified 247 cases of AIDS-related PCL. Differences between patients with AIDS and immunocompetent PCL were noted in our series. AIDS-related PCL when compared to non-AIDS PCL in our series has the following notable clinical features: 1) significantly younger age at presentation, median age 34 versus 59 years; 2) significantly higher incidence of B symptoms, 44% versus 8%; 3) worse median performance status at presentation, 3 versus 1; and, 4) shorter median survival, 3 versus 10 months. Differences in performance status and survival, however, were not significant. AIDS-related PCL is further characterized by frequent (44%) ring-enhancing mass lesions on head CT scan, a finding that makes it clinically difficult to distinguish from toxoplasmosis. Median survival appears to be improved in the absence of opportunistic infection at time of diagnosis of PCL, 6 versus 2 months. The therapeutic approach to patients with PCL, with and without AIDS, is variable. Combined modality therapy may improve the survival in patients with non-AIDS PCL. Therapy for patients with AIDS-related PCL is tailored to the status of the individual and it is, therefore, difficult to make comparisons to non-AIDS PCL patients. AIDS patients are often too ill to tolerate aggressive surgery or systemic treatment and in this instance, radiotherapy alone may be an acceptable alternative. Nonetheless, overall survival for patients with AIDS-related and non-AIDS PCL remains poor.

text: Hypoxia induces a specific set of stress proteins in cultured endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are the initial cells within the vascular wall exposed to decreases in blood ambient oxygen concentration. The mechanisms by which they tolerate low levels of oxygen are unknown, but may parallel the response to other cellular stresses, such as heat shock. After 4-8 h of hypoxia, we found a decrease in total protein synthesis in both cultured bovine aortic and pulmonary arterial EC. SDS-PAGE and autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins demonstrated the concomitant induction of a specific set of proteins (Mr 34, 36, 47, and 56 kD) in both cell types. These hypoxia-associated proteins (HAPs) were cell-associated and up-regulated in a time- and oxygen concentration-dependent manner. Comparison of these proteins with heat shock proteins (HSPs) demonstrated that HAPs were distinct from HSPs. EC maintained chronically in 3% O2 continued to synthesize elevated levels of HAPs, yet further up-regulated these proteins when exposed to 0% O2. The presence of five times the normal media glucose concentration did not alter the appearance of HAPs. Hypoxia sensitive renal tubular epithelial cells up-regulated no proteins corresponding to HAPs and were irreversibly damaged within 8 h of exposure to 0% O2. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that the steady-state level of several mRNAs was higher in the anoxic EC than in normoxic EC and encoded for proteins of Mr 32, 35, 37, 40, and 48 kD that were different from proteins encoded by HSP mRNAs. The induction of HAPs during acute hypoxia and their continued synthesis in chronic hypoxia suggest that HAPs may be important in the maintenance of endothelial cell integrity under conditions of decreased ambient oxygen.

text: Collis gastroplasty: origin and evolution. In 1957 J. Leigh Collis published his innovative operation for treating the difficult problem of the irreducible hiatal hernia, esophagitis, and stricture. The design of the operation was based on the relatively primitive understanding of hiatal hernia and the newly emerging concept of reflux esophagitis. A variety of antireflux operations by different surgeons emerged over the years to follow. The original Collis gastroplasty has been subsequently modified with the addition of both partial and complete fundoplication procedures. The place of the modified Collis gastroplasty-fundoplication operations in today's approach to the problems of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease remains unsettled.

text: Carotid endarterectomy: a ten-year analysis of outcome and cost of treatment. Between 1978 and 1988, 215 patients with an average age of 67 years, underwent 246 carotid endarterectomies. Two hundred ten (85.4%) patients were symptomatic, and 36 (14.6%) were asymptomatic. Six patients (2.4%) had a postoperative stroke, and all had immediate reoperation. One of these patients died (30 day mortality rate, 0.4% for the series), and two (0.8%) recovered completely, whereas three (1.2%) had a mild permanent neurologic deficit. Two patients (0.8%) had nonfatal myocardial infarction. Mean follow-up of 42.2 months (range, 1 to 126 months) was achieved. At 5 and 8 years actuarial survival rates of 82% and 66% and stroke-free survival rates of 67% and 37% were observed. Actuarial stroke free rates of 90% at 5 and 8 years were noted. By introducing and observing guidelines that required preoperative study of most clearly defined classes of patients before admission for surgical treatment, the average length of stay for carotid endarterectomy was lowered from 9.5 days in the first 5 years of the study to 5.8 days in the second 5 years (p = 0.001). Average hospital charges, expressed in constant dollars, decreased from $3113 in the first 5 years to $2620 in the second 5 years (p = 0.02) despite an 88% inflationary increase in medical consumer price index. This experience shows that the length of hospitalization of patients with carotid endarterectomy can be reduced and the cost of admission lowered without untoward effect on perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.

text: Effect of morphine on growth of metastatic colon cancer in vivo. Control of colon cancer depends, in part, on intact immune defense mechanisms. Since opiates are known to affect some components of immune function, this study was conducted to determine the effect of high-dose subcutaneous morphine sulfate and of low-dose intrathecal morphine on the postoperative growth of metastatic colon cancer. Five groups of 15 Fischer 344 rats were given intraportal injections of colon cancer cells as follows: group 1, control; group 2, daily subcutaneous injections of 20-mg/kg morphine the day before and for 2 days after colon cancer cell inoculation; group 3, daily subcutaneous injections of saline; group 4, daily intrathecal injections of 20 micrograms of morphine; and group 5, daily intrathecal injections of saline. There was a significant decrease in the hepatic tumor burden in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3 and a significant increase in the hepatic tumor burden in groups 4 and 5 compared with group 1. This study demonstrates that intermittent injections of a narcotic may decrease the growth of tumor cells that gain access to the circulation during a surgical procedure. In addition, the results support the concept that tumor cells entering the circulation during a vulnerable period of postoperative immunosuppression are more likely to survive as metastatic tumor.

text: Hormone implants and tachyphylaxis. The serum oestradiol levels of 1388 women treated with hormone implants at a menopause clinic were reviewed in 1988. Thirty-eight (3%) were found to be above 1750 pmol/l. Of these 38 women with supraphysiological oestradiol levels 23 had started therapy for menopausal symptoms and 15 for the premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Of the 23 women treated for menopausal symptoms 11 had a history of psychiatric referral for depression and nine had undergone a surgical menopause. Nine of the 15 women with PMS had a history of psychiatric referral for depressive symptoms. We conclude that the women who attain supraphysiological levels of oestradiol on implant therapy have a high frequency of psychopathology or surgical menopause and may require higher oestradiol levels for adequate control of symptoms.

text: Coronary balloon angioplasty through diagnostic 6 French catheters. We investigated the use of ultralow profile balloon catheters (Scimed ACE, USCI Probe, Cordis, Orion) for coronary angioplasty through 6 French diagnostic catheters (Schneider, Cordis). Contrast injection was assisted with a Hercules pump (Cordis) in all cases. During 21 procedures, angioplasty of 27 lesions in 20 selected patients was attempted (1.3 lesion/procedure). Twelve lesions were in the right, 10 in the left anterior descending, and 5 in the left circumflex coronary artery. Balloon size varied between 2.5 and 3.5 mm. Twenty lesions could be successfully dilated (74%) through the 6 French catheter and 7 lesions required an exchange to a 7 French angioplasty guiding catheter. For 5 cases, another balloon was also necessary to complete the procedure. The final overall success rate was 100% per patient and per lesion and there were no major complications. Despite the small internal catheter lumen (1.22 mm) coronary visualization was adequate, and mechanical support was good. Failures of 6 French catheters were attributed to insufficient torque control and excessive friction when the balloon crossed the tapered end of the diagnostic catheter. Coronary angioplasty through a diagnostic 6 French catheter is feasible and may represent a reasonable alternative for simple cases that are done during the same session as the diagnostic angiography. Once available, 6 French high flow angioplasty guiding catheters without a tapered tip should improve success while retaining the advantage of a small femoral puncture site.

text: Penetrating aortic ulcers: diagnosis with MR imaging. The authors studied seven patients with penetrating aortic ulcers with use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. All patients were evaluated for acute chest symptoms, and the presence of aortic ulcers was confirmed by means of angiography in all seven patients. Five patients also underwent computed tomography (CT). Three patients underwent surgical repair of the thoracic aorta. MR findings included intramural hematoma and focal aortic wall ulceration in four patients, focal ulceration in one, focal intramural hematoma in one, and focal intramural hematoma with rupture in one. The diagnosis of intramural hematoma was made by the detection of increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MR images. MR imaging was superior to angiography in depicting the extent of intramural thrombus, although one ulceration diagnosed at angiography was missed at MR imaging. MR imaging was superior to CT in differentiating acute intramural hematoma from atherosclerotic plaque and chronic intraluminal thrombus, although it did not depict displaced intimal calcification in one patient with extensive intramural hematoma.

text: Febrile status epilepticus As part of a study of status epilepticus in children (Maytal J, Shinnar S, Moshe SL, Alvarez LA. Pediatrics. 1989; 83:323-331); 44 children with febrile convulsions lasting more than 30 minutes were followed for a mean of 28 months (range 4 to 72). Thirty children were followed prospectively. Children with prior afebrile seizures or evidence of acute central nervous system infection were excluded. Nine (20%) children had prior neurological deficits. The duration of the febrile seizure was 0.5 to 1 hour in 41 cases (85%), 1 to 2 hours in 5 (10%), and greater than 2 hours in 2 children (5%). No child died or developed new neurological deficits following the seizures. The risk of recurrent seizures was increased, but only in the group with prior neurological abnormality. Six (66%) of these children had subsequent febrile seizures compared with 12 (34%) of the normal children (P =.08). Three (33%) had recurrent febrile status epilepticus compared with only 1 (3%) normal child (P =.023). The 2 children in the prospective arm of the study with recurrent febrile status epilepticus were both neurologically abnormal (P =.035). All 3 of the children who subsequently had afebrile seizures (2 prospective) were neurologically abnormal (P =.006 overall, P =.035 for prospective only). It is concluded that the occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in a neurologically impaired child is a risk factor for subsequent febrile as well as afebrile seizures. The occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in an otherwise normal child does not significantly increase the risk for subsequent febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures in the first few years following the episode.

text: Morphine-induced transactivation of HIV-1 LTR in human neuroblastoma cells. Infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is followed in many cases by a clinically quiescent or latent phase that appears to continue as long as host antiviral defense is intact. This has raised the possibility that certain host susceptibility factors (i.e., environmental cofactors) might influence the progression of the disease. In this study we demonstrate that morphine can function to activate HIV/LTR-CAT fusion gene (HIV-long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) when transfected into undifferentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of morphine is amplified in SH-SY5Y cells that have been induced to differentiate first with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and is much less in cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA). Morphine does not appreciably activate HIV/LTR-CAT expression in human MOLT-3 and other T cells. Morphine activation of HIV/LTR-CAT in the SH-SY5Y cells is not reversible by naltrexone and appears to involve a Fos/Jun signaling system. Our results suggest that narcotics such as morphine may lead to activation of latent HIV infection. This may be particularly important in tissues, such as brain, which can host latent HIV infection and which is uniquely damaged in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as evidenced by neuronal degeneration and dementia. We also predict that these findings may have important implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS, particularly in opiate drug abusers.

text: Management of meralgia paresthetica Meralgia paresthetica is a syndrome of pain or dysesthesia, or both, in the anterolateral thigh caused by entrapment or neurinoma formation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Conservative treatment was successful in relieving symptoms in 91% of 277 patients with this syndrome; however, 24 patients required surgical treatment for intractable symptoms. Although neurolysis with transposition is the most common procedure, sectioning of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was performed in 24 cases and was successful in 23. One patient had early symptomatic relief, but subsequently developed different neurological signs and symptoms because of an undetected pelvic neoplasm. Anatomical variations of the nerve and neurinomas, which occur frequently, are easily handled with sectioning but may lead to recurrence with neurolysis and transposition.

text: Clinical features and natural history of von Hippel-Lindau disease The clinical features, age at onset and survival of 152 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease were studied. Mean age at onset was 26.3 years and 97 per cent of patients had presented by aged 60 years. Retinal angioma was the first manifestation in 65 patients (43 per cent), followed by cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 60, 39 per cent) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 15, 10 per cent). Overall, 89 patients (59 per cent) developed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, 89 (59 per cent) a retinal angioma, 43 (28 per cent) renal cell carcinoma, 20 (13 per cent) spinal haemangioblastoma and 11 (7 per cent) a phaeochromocytoma. Renal, pancreatic and epididymal cysts were frequent findings but their exact incidence was not accurately assessed. Mean age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (44.0 +/- 10.9 years) was significantly older than that for cerebellar haemangioblastoma (29.0 +/- 10.0 years) and retinal angioma (25.4 +/- 12.7 years). The probability of a patient with von Hippel-Lindan disease developing a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, retinal angioma or renal cell carcinoma by age 60 years was 0.84, 0.7 and 0.69, respectively. A comprehensive screening protocol for affected patients and at-risk relatives is presented, based on detailed analysis of age at onset data for each of the major complications. Median actuarial survival was 49 years, with renal cell carcinoma the leading cause of death.

text: Portacaval shunt versus endoscopic sclerotherapy in the elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Eighty-two consecutive Child-Campbell class A and B cirrhotic patients were included in a prospective controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of portacaval anastomosis vs. endoscopic sclerotherapy as elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Forty-one patients were randomized to portacaval anastomosis and 41 to sclerotherapy. After excluding dropouts, 34 patients were treated with portacaval anastomosis and 35 with sclerotherapy. The incidence of variceal rebleeding during follow-up (mean +/- SD, 20.6 +/- 14.2 months) was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy than in the portacaval groups, either considering the overall treated group or only patients completing sclerotherapy (40% and 25% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.0002 and P = 0.01, respectively). The 2-year probability of suffering from at least one episode of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in patients submitted to portacaval anastomosis than in those treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy (40% vs. 12%; P = 0.04). However, disabling encephalopathy only appeared in 3 of 34 patients who underwent surgery (8.8%). Early and long-term mortality did not differ between the therapeutic groups; 2-year survival rates were 83% for portacaval anastomosis and 79% for sclerotherapy. It is concluded that portacaval anastomosis is more effective than endoscopic sclerotherapy in preventing variceal rebleeding in spite of the greater incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The role of portacaval anastomosis in the elective treatment of variceal rebleeding should be reasses

text: Susceptibility to invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype. There has been considerable controversy about the role of the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype and risk of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease. This allotype was studied in a large cohort of Finnish children (178) with invasive Hib disease. The G2m(n) allotype distribution was similar to that in the normal white Finnish population. No increased risk of Hib disease could be associated with the n-/n- genotype [i.e., lack of G2m(n) allotype]. Thus, the G2m(n) allotype does not seem to be a major determinant of susceptibility to Hib infection among white populations in industrialized countries.

text: Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on growth, metastasis, fatty acid profile and prostaglandin production of two murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4). Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal. Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO. Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate. Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors. Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO. FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO. These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis.

The relative risk of subjects with low carotene (less than 0.23 mumol/L) was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) for lung cancer (Cox's model). Higher risks were noted for all cancer (P less than 0.01) if both carotene and retinol were low. Low plasma carotene which is known to reflect carotene intake is in our study associated with increased cancer risk.

text: Experience with esmolol for the treatment of cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. The authors report their experience using esmolol, an ultra-short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, for the treatment of seven patients with cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications. No consistent hemodynamic benefit was found with the use of this drug. Although there was a decline in mean heart rate of 23% (range 0% to 35%), they were unable to show a consistent antihypertensive response. Adverse effects occurred in three patients. This included one patient with a marked exacerbation of hypertension and one who became hypotensive. Another patient developed emesis and lethargy during esmolol therapy and required endotracheal intubation. They do not recommend the routine use of esmolol for cocaine cardiotoxicity.

text: Detrusor hyper-reflexia as a factor in spontaneous perforation of augmentation cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder. In a series of 30 children undergoing cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder, 14 had a combination of a competent sphincteric mechanism and detrusor hyper-reflexia. All 3 cases of spontaneous perforation of the augmentation occurred within this latter group and it is postulated that excessive intravesical pressure due to high pressure hyper-reflexia was the causal factor. Strategies to reduce the risk of perforation are discussed.

text: Low-dose heparinization can be used with DEAE-cellulose hemodialysis membranes. The ability of DEAE-cellulose (Hemophan) membranes to bind heparin may reduce bioavailable heparin and predispose to dialyzer clotting, thus preventing use of Hemophan with low-dose heparin. To examine this possibility, residual blood volumes were determined following 95 treatments with dialyzers containing Hemophan membranes in 11 patients. No heparin was added to the saline used to prime the dialyzers. The anticoagulant effect of heparin was measured using recalcified activated clotting times (RACT). Two heparin doses, calculated by a pharmacokinetic model to increase baseline RACT by 12.5% and 25%, were used for each patient. The mean heparin loading doses were 10.2 +/- 2.8 and 15.3 +/- 2.2 IU/kg, respectively, and the mean infusion rates were 11.1 +/- 3.2 and 14.7 +/- 3.2 IU/kg/h, respectively. Residual blood volumes were determined by red cell lysis and hemoglobinometry. In 88 treatments, residual blood volume averaged 1.6 +/- 1.5 ml. In the other seven treatments, residual blood volume greater than 10 ml was seen. In five of these cases, clotting appeared to propagate from the arterial drip chamber. Residual blood volume did not correlate with the level of heparin. The data show that low-dose heparin can be used with Hemophan membranes, and suggest that blood tubing design may be an important factor in blood circuit clotting during hemodialysis.

text: A phase I trial of cisplatin in hypertonic saline and escalating doses of 5-fluorouracil by continuous intravenous infusion in patients with advanced malignancies. Thirty-four patients with incurable solid tumors were treated in a Phase I trial with a fixed dose of high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) administered in hypertonic saline and escalating doses of infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Five treatment levels of 5-FU, ranging from 500 to 900 mg/m2/day for 5 days, were studied. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and oral mucositis were the dose-limiting toxicities encountered. Nephrotoxicity was minimal. Ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathies were rare and mild in this patient group, but most patients received only a small number of treatment cycles. Diarrhea was not dose-limiting. Two complete responses (one non-small cell lung cancer and one sweat gland carcinoma) were observed. No other major responses were noted. With the dose of CDDP set at 35 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a concurrent 5-day 5-FU infusion was found to be 900 mg/m2/day. The recommended dosages for Phase II trials are 35 mg/m2/day CDDP and 800 mg/m2/day 5-FU for 5 consecutive days. Cancers of the lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract would be reasonable targets for Phase II studies.

text: Preferential localization of human adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells in tumor microcirculation. The efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors with lymphokine-activated effector cells presumably depends on the ability of these cells to localize adequately in tumor tissues. We present here the first quantitative study of the in vivo movement of fluorescently labeled adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells. These cells were injected intra-arterially along with low-dose interleukin-2 into normal (mature granulation) tissue and an implant of VX2 carcinoma grown in the rabbit ear chamber. A small proportion of A-LAK cells accumulated preferentially in the tumor microcirculation in vivo because of an increased frequency of long-term adhesive interactions with the tumor vasculature. Stasis of blood flow in the tumor vasculature was observed 1 to 2 days after injection. Subsequent necrosis of the tumors was observed, along with diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in the interstitial space within the tumor. Development of necrosis despite low ratios of effector cells to target cells suggests that in addition to direct cytotoxicity, the response to adoptive immunotherapy is mediated via the tumor vasculature. This novel mechanism for adoptive immunotherapy must be taken into account in the development of improved strategies for cancer treatment.

text: Acute gastroenteritis in infants under 6 months old. Sixty two babies under the age of 6 months who were admitted with gastroenteritis completed a study of gradual refeeding compared with abrupt refeeding after a period of rehydration. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence of diarrhoea due to lactose intolerance, effect on weight, or duration of hospital stay. Twenty six babies (42%) had recurrence of diarrhoea after refeeding, all of whom settled with the introduction of a lactose free soya based formula. Well nourished babies under 6 months of age with mild to moderately severe gastroenteritis can be fed immediately with full strength milk feeds after rehydration. The introduction of a lactose free soya based preparation may provide an alternative to repeated attempts at regrading with cows' milk feeds in those patients with lactose intolerance.

text: Ultrastructural changes in rat hearts following cold cardioplegic ischemia of differing duration and differing modes of reperfusion. Morphologic consequences of prolonged global hypothermic (15 degrees C), cardioplegic ischemia and two reperfusion techniques were studied in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. A 'gentle' reperfusion technique, with gradual rise in perfusate temperature and pressure to physiologic levels over 30 min, was used for 12 hearts following 2-hour or 3 1/2-hour (6 in each group) ischemia. Abrupt reperfusion, with perfusate at 37 degrees C and 70 mmHg, was performed on 13 hearts (6 ischemic for 2 hours and 7 for 3 1/2 hours). Six nonischemic, perfused hearts served as controls. Randomly selected specimens from the left ventricle after 45-60 min reperfusion were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Volume fractions of myocardial structural components were calculated from stereologic point-counting on the electron micrographs. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that interstitial edema developed with increasing ischemic time and was not influenced by reperfusion technique. The degree of endothelial damage was independent of ischemic time, but was lessened by 'gentle' reperfusion. Both mitochondrial injury and myocyte edema were less when perfusate temperature and pressure were slowly raised after 3 1/2-hour ischemia.

A radical excision that included cystoprostatectomy, total penectomy, scrotectomy, pubic symphysiectomy, and abdominoperineal resection of rectum was done. The patient died of systemic metastases six months after diagnosis. Review of the literature suggests that such a cancer of the prostate is rare, highly aggressive, and responds poorly to any mode of therapy. Histogenesis of this tumor remains controversial; however, it probably does not originate from the prostatic acinar cells.

text: Prospective study of early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. We prospectively monitored 140 cirrhotic patients for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma for 6 yr, using periodical screening by high-resolution convex-array ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein. Twenty-eight patients were positive for HBs antigen, 26 patients had received blood transfusions and were negative for HBs antigen and 26 patients had a history of heavy drinking. We detected hepatocellular carcinoma in 40 patients during this period. The overall cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the 6 yr was 39%; the cumulative incidence was 59% in patients with HBsAg, 53% in patients who had had blood transfusions and were negative for HBsAg and 22% in patients who had a history of heavy drinking and who were without HBsAg. Detection of the carcinoma in 85% of these 40 patients was based on results of ultrasonography. Twenty-six of the patients (65%) had a small hepatocellular carcinoma of 2 cm or less. alpha-Fetoprotein levels were lower than 100 ng/ml in 56% of these 40 patients. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially patients with HBsAg or with a history of blood transfusion who are negative for HBsAg. Periodic monitoring by use of ultrasonography in particular is recommended for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.

text: Adverse mortality experience of a southwestern American Indian community: overall death rates and underlying causes of death in Pima Indians. As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of

text: Effects of the differentiating agent hexamethylene bisacetamide on normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA; NSC 95580) is a potent polar-planar differentiating agent of leukemia and solid tumor cell lines in vitro at clinically achievable concentrations. HMBA is currently being studied in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Previous phase I trials have demonstrated that HMBA produces hematologic toxicity in morphologically normal bone marrows of patients with solid tumors. Because of concern that HMBA may produce more severe myelotoxicity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome since these patients have limited hematopoietic reserves, we studied the effects of HMBA on myelodysplastic and normal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. HMBA concentrations that are optimal for differentiation in vitro (2 to 5 mmol/L) and HMBA concentrations that are being achieved in clinical trials (1 to 2 mmol/L) inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units from all 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and all 4 normal subjects, HMBA did not induce proliferation of myelodysplastic or normal progenitors at any concentration; rather, it produced nearly identical inhibition of normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. HMBA also produced quantitatively similar inhibition of clonogenic leukemic growth of two myeloid leukemia cell lines. For a differentiating agent to be effective, it will likely have to either produce both differentiation and proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic progenitors or show selective inhibitory effects on abnormal as compared with normal progenitors. Although the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of HMBA cannot be determined from this study, similar inhibitory effects of HM

text: Sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension. Between 1953 and 1988, 21 patients with splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), 12 of whom had sinistral portal hypertension (SPH) were treated at our institution. SVT was identified at autopsy in nine patients. Twelve additional patients presented with SPH: bleeding esophageal varices, SVT and normal hepatic function. SVT was caused by pancreatic neoplasm (5), chronic pancreatitis (5), and pancreatic pseudocyst (2). SVT was diagnosed by splanchnic angiography, splenoportography, computerized tomography, and ultrasonography. Gastric varices were diagnosed by endoscopy (10) and barium swallow (2). Splenectomy was performed as primary therapy in 10 patients. Three of these 10 had en block distal pancreatectomy. Two high-risk patients had splenic artery embolization, one as a prelude to splenectomy performed 48 hours later and the other as definitive therapy. One splenectomized patient continued to bleed. No further bleeding occurred in 10 splenectomized patients in follow-up from 1 week to 14 years. Sinistral portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome of splenic vein thrombosis caused by pancreatic pathology and manifests as bleeding gastric varices in patients with a patent portal vein and normal hepatic function. Splanchnic arteriography is necessary for accurate diagnosis. Splenectomy is the effective treatment of choice.

text: Vascular flow capacity of hindlimb skeletal muscles in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Total and regional skeletal muscle flows (radiolabeled microspheres) were determined in isolated maximally vasodilated hindquarters of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched (11-12 mo) normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to assess the vascular flow capacity of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total hindquarters and regional muscle blood flows (under conditions of maximal vasodilation with papaverine or papaverine plus isoproterenol) over a wide range of perfusion pressures in WKY and SHR. Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by determining the capillary filtration coefficient. Isogravimetric capillary pressures and segmental vascular resistances were determined in each hindquarter. Isogravimetric flows and capillary pressures were not different between WKY and SHR. However, total and precapillary vascular resistances were significantly elevated in SHR, and postcapillary resistances were not different compared with WKY. Maximal capillary filtration coefficient values for the SHR group averaged 20% lower than WKY values, suggesting that hypertension was associated with a reduction in the microvascular surface area available for fluid exchange and, therefore, the capillary exchange capacity. Over the perfusion pressures studied, total hindquarters flows averaged 60% lower in SHR than in WKY. Flows to individual skeletal muscles averaged 76% lower in SHR than in WKY regardless of the muscle fiber type. Thus, modifications exist in the hindlimb skeletal muscle vasculature of SHR that reduces the capillary exchange capacity and limit the capacity of deliver flow at a given perfusion pressure gradient.

text: Decreased operative risk of surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation with or without coronary artery disease. The consecutive 2 year experience with patients undergoing first-time surgery for mitral regurgitation with and without coronary artery disease was reviewed. From January 1988 to January 1990, 127 patients with pure mitral regurgitation undergoing first-time operation were surgically treated. No other valve lesion, no reoperation and no congenital defects were included. The mean patient age was 62 years with 26% of the patients greater than 70 years. Twenty-six percent of the entire group was in functional class IV. Seventy-five patients received mitral valve repair and 52 underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude or Hancock valve. In patients undergoing mitral valve repair, there was a higher incidence of those greater than 70 years old and of coronary artery disease and in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement there was a higher incidence of functional class IV. The operative mortality rate was 2.3% (3 of 127 patients). No patient failed to be discontinued from cardiopulmonary bypass and all three deaths occurred after mitral valve replacement, with one from complications of chronic renal failure and dialysis. There was no significant difference in patients who either did or did not have a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and there was no difference related to age or functional class. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients in the valve repair group, including recurrent mitral regurgitation in two necessitating reoperation, and in three patients in the valve replacement group. With newer operative and postoperative management techniques, especially preservation of the papillary muscle annular continuity, the risk of mitral valve surgery, particularly of valve repair, is considerably lower than in previous years.

text: Outcome of renal transplantation after urinary diversion and enterocystoplasty: a retrospective, controlled study. A total of 17 patients with intestinal urinary diversion of enterocystoplasty underwent renal transplantation between 1970 and 1988. Patient age ranged from 4 to 35 years (mean age 20 years). The patients were divided into 2 groups. In group 1 (10 patients, 2 of whom required retransplantation) the ureter of the transplanted kidney was implanted into an ileal (7) or colonic (1) conduit or enterocystoplasty (2). In group 2 (7 patients, 1 of whom required a second transplant) the diversion was taken down and the transplanted ureter was implanted into the defunctionalized bladder. There were 14 living related and 6 cadaveric kidneys transplanted. Graft survival rates were 58 and 87% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, with an over-all rate of 70% (14 of 20 kidneys). There was no statistical difference in the graft survival rate between the 2 groups. The complications in group 1 included ureteroileal anastomotic leak (3 patients), ureteroileal stenosis (1), calculus formation (1), urosepsis (1), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (1), and wound infection and dehiscence (1). There were no complications in group 2. Renal transplantation into a pre-existing urinary intestinal conduit or augmented bladder does not statistically adversely affect patient or graft survival. However, the complication rate is much higher when the ureter is implanted into an intestinal segment. Therefore, it is preferable whenever possible to implant the ureter into the native bladder.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-labeled hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the outcome after temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures. Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy.

text: Rapid and correct diagnosis of myocardial infarction: standardized case history and clinical examination provide important information for correct referral to monitored beds. The value of thorough examination of the case history as a diagnostic tool on hospitalization of patients with suspected myocardial infarction was investigated in three independent prospective studies. Use of a limited number of pain-related elements (= 'criteria'), that had already been obtained in the emergency room, could improve the decision on whether or not to admit patients to the coronary-care unit. As an example, in one of the studies, use of such criteria would have reduced the number of 'unnecessary' coronary-care-unit admissions from 298 to 162, a 46% reduction (P less than 0.001). In the same patient sample, use of the criteria could have reduced the number of patients with definite acute myocardial infarction, admitted to the general wards, from 47 to 22, a 53% reduction (P less than 0.01). These favourable results were confirmed in the two independent, smaller-scale studies.

text: Ten-year prospective study on the development of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients. A prospective study was undertaken to investigate the development of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients. Three renal cell carcinomas were detected among 96 hemodialysis patients in 1979, and screening by computed tomographic (CT) scan was continued yearly until 1989. During this 10-year period, one renal cell carcinoma was found in the second year and another in the ninth year. Autopsy performed on seven of 19 patients who died showed one case of small clear cell carcinoma accompanying acquired cystic disease. In 33 males, kidneys were found to have enlarged 2.7 +/- 1.7 times over the 10-year follow-up due to acquired cysts, while no change in kidney volume was noted in 24 females. Native kidneys in nine of 12 patients who maintained functioning grafts were reduced in size. The patient with the largest kidney enlargement (11.5 times) died from retroperitoneal bleeding in 1989. These prospective study results suggest that both the incidence and prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients is high. Furthermore, major complications of acquired renal cystic disease seem to occur predominantly in males.

text: The effects of generation and gender on the joint distributions of lipid and apolipoprotein phenotypes in the population at large. The generation and gender effects on the joint distributions of total plasma cholesterol (Total-C), ln triglycerides (lnTrig), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoproteins AI (Apo AI), AII (Apo AII), and E (lnApo E) were studied in 184 male grandparents (MGP), 242 female grandparents (FGP), 237 male parents (MP), 235 female parents (FP), 202 male children (MC), and 200 female children (FC). Homogeneity of variance tests revealed that lipid variances were gender and/or generation specific while apolipoprotein variances were homogeneous across strata. In the absence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity in LDL:lnTrig and lnTrig:Apo AII covariation was found between genders in the parental generation. In the presence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity of correlation between genders and/or across generations was found for the HDL-C:LDL-C, Total-C:LDL-C, Total-C:lnTrig, lnTrig:LDL-C, Total-C:lnApo E and HDL-C:lnApo E bivariate distributions. Analyses of principal components revealed that the generation and gender specific cohorts have similar eigenvalues but distinct eigenvectors for the first two principal components underlying the seven dimensional lipid and apolipoprotein distribution. We conclude that the amount of variability explained by the first two principal components is the same across cohorts but how the interindividual variability is distributed among the lipid and apolipoprotein traits is generation and gender specific. This study documents the role that variance and covariance might play in determining risk

These cases represent four of 42 (9%) cases of osteosarcoma at all sites in this institution during the period 1979 to 1989, when more than 1000 patients were treated with radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The latent periods varied from 8 to 11 years from completion of radiotherapy treatment to development of osteosarcoma. The radiation dosage varied from 6000 to 6280 cGy in three of the patients. These cases fit the criteria for diagnosis of postirradiation sarcomas. Maxillary osteosarcomas after irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma do not appear to have been described. The very high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (for which radiotherapy is the treatment of choice) in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors more likely in Hong Kong, although the small risk does not contraindicate the use of radiation in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in view of its well-documented efficacy.

text: Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury following femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Two cases are presented exhibiting symptoms and signs of bilateral anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury, clinically sparing femoral nerve branches to the saphenous nerve and quadriceps muscles. This occurred following surgical dissection in the femoral triangles associated with femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury should be considered when anterior medial thigh pain and numbness occur following aortofemoral bypass graft surgery and other types of femoral artery reconstructive surgery.

text: Collagen metabolism in gynecologic patients: changes in the concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in serum. We have previously found the serum concentration of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, an indicator of collagen metabolism, to be increased in advanced ovarian cancer. In this study we measured the serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen concentration in healthy women during the menstrual cycle and in patients with salpingo-oophoritis, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and benign ovarian tumors. The concentration was higher in the luteal phase than that in the follicular phase, suggesting an association of collagen metabolism with ovarian steroid hormones. Severe salpingo-oophoritis increased the serum level of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen with a decrease to normal during recovery. Elevated values were occasionally seen in endometriosis and leiomyomas. These findings indicate that the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is a relatively unspecific indicator of ovarian carcinoma.

text: Effect of V1-vasopressin receptor blockade on arterial pressure in conscious rats with cirrhosis and ascites. Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin in human cirrhosis with ascites is associated with a significant reduction in arterial pressure, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II plays an important role in the maintenance of systemic hemodynamics in this condition. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether vasopressin also contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhosis with ascites. The study was performed using three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites and three groups of control animals. The administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective antagonist of the vascular effect of vasopressin, to 10 cirrhotic rats induced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 94 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and a significant increase in plasma renin activity (from 24.3 +/- 4.9 to 34.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL.h; P less than 0.02) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 1474 +/- 133 to 2433 +/- 253 pg/mL; P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed following saralasin administration in a second group of 5 cirrhotic rats [mean arterial pressure decreased from 97 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.0001); and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentration increased from 18.4 +/- 5.8 to 40.3 +/- 5.7 ng/mL.h (P less than 0.02) and from 1383 +/- 70 to 2312 +/- 334 pg/mL (P less than 0.05), respectively].

text: Cholinergic deficiency and frontal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To investigate the influence of central cholinergic deficit on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the neuropsychological performance of a group of 20 patients who were treated with anticholinergic drugs (mean daily dose, 10.2 mg) with that of a group of 20 patients who received no anticholinergics. The two groups were matched for all the variables of parkinsonism and levodopa therapy. At the dose used, there was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for intellectual, visuospatial, instrumental, and memory function. In contrast, in the group that received anticholinergics severe impairment was observed on tests believed to assess frontal lobe function. These results suggest that the lesion of the ascending cholinergic neurons, which has been demonstrated post mortem in PD, may play a role in the subcorticofrontal behavioral impairment of this disease.

text: Cholesterol screening in a black inner-city pediatric population. A screening for total blood cholesterol levels was conducted by the University of Louisville Department of Family Practice in association with the National Youth Sports Program in Louisville, Kentucky. On May 30, 1987, 224 inner-city children between 10 and 16 years of age were tested; 109 (49%) were girls and 115 (51%) were boys. All participants were black. Of the entire population, the girls had a slightly lower mean level of cholesterol than the boys (160 mg/dL vs 165 mg/dL, respectively). Because of the large number of participants aged 10 to 14 years (211), this subset of children was studied more closely. In this age group, 47 (22%) of the children were at moderate risk for future cardiovascular disease and 48 (23%) were at high risk. The serum cholesterol levels were relatively constant in all children until age 12, after which a slight reduction occurred. This decrease is more evident in boys. Our study also showed a correlation between increased blood cholesterol and above normal weight/height indices (ie, Quetelet scores), with nearly 70% of all children having elevated cholesterol levels also exhibiting above normal Quetelet scores. We observed no correlation between high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in this study population. Dietary intervention is recommended as the initial treatment for elevated cholesterol levels in children.

text: Induction of protein kinase C mRNA in cultured lymphoblastoid T cells by iron-transferrin but not by soluble iron. Iron-transferrin (FeTF) is an essential growth factor required for proliferation of lymphoid cells. FeTF activates protein kinase C (PKC) in the lymphoblastoid T-cell line, CCRF-CEM. We have treated CEM cells with human FeTF, then examined levels of PKC mRNA by hybridization analysis using cDNA probes specific for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-PKC subspecies. CEM cell mRNA hybridized with the beta-subspecies probe but not with probes for alpha- or gamma-subspecies. After exposure to FeTF an increase in PKC-beta mRNA was detectable at 10 minutes, peaked at 12 hours, and was sustained for 72 hours. Nuclear transcription assays demonstrated that rates of PKC-beta mRNA transcription were increased in FeTF-treated cells. By contrast, steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA did not increase after treatment of cells with apotransferrin or gallium TF. Similarly, treatment with soluble iron as ferric ammonium citrate did not increase steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA, despite producing a marked increase in cellular ferritin content. Ferritin increased from a baseline value of 63 ng/10(6) cells to 98 and 100 ng/10(6) cells in CEM cells treated for 1 hour with ferric ammonium citrate or FeTF, respectively. FeTF did not increase cytoplasmic-free calcium in CEM cells loaded with fura-2, indicating that binding of FeTF to transferrin receptors did not open membrane Ca2+ channels or release intracellular Ca2+. In addition, pretreatment of cells with desferrioxamine, but not ferrioxamine, blocked the FeTF-induced increase in PKC-beta transcripts

text: Detection of Coxsackievirus B3 RNA in myocardial tissues by the polymerase chain reaction. Coxsackievirus B3 is a possible etiologic agent in some forms of myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A method for the detection of coxsackievirus B3 RNA was developed using the polymerase chain reaction based on the amplification of a cDNA copy of the positive-strand viral RNA. The fidelity of the method was established in two murine models for coxsackie B3 myocarditis. All cardiac specimens with adequate RNA for study from coxsackie B3-infected mice contained detectable viral RNA, in contrast to none of control specimens from noninfected mice. The sensitivity of the technique was established at approximately 1 to 100 plaque-forming units of virus per gram of tissue, and the specificity was established as limited to the coxsackievirus B3 serotype among nine viruses tested. In patients with myocarditis, one of five specimens contained detectable viral RNA, whereas none of 11 specimens from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or 21 myocardial specimens from patients with a wide variety of other cardiac disorders contained detectable coxsackie B3 viral RNA. The results show that the polymerase chain reaction is a useful means for detecting coxsackie viral RNA and its application should help in the evaluation of hypotheses concerning the infectious etiology of human myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

text: Hemorrhagic pituitary adenomas: clinicopathological features and surgical treatment. Forty-five (9.9%) of 453 pituitary adenomas operated on between January 1973 and November 1988 demonstrated hemorrhagic changes at surgery: 24 had a blood collection, 12 had a blood collection associated with hemorrhagic necrosis, and 9 had hemorrhagic necrosis. Thirteen patients (28.9%) experienced the acute symptoms of pituitary apoplexy, whereas another 32 had an ""asymptomatic"" hemorrhage, that is, the clinical course was comparable to an uncomplicated adenoma. Nineteen tumors (42.2%) showed marked suprasellar extension, 8 (17.8%) showed moderate extension, and 11 (24.5%) showed slight extension; another 2 (4.4%) were laterosellar and 5 (11.1%) were intrasellar. Invasive behavior was present in 32 cases (71.1%) and this may suggest another hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of tumoral hemorrhage. The incidence of hemorrhagic complications in invasive adenomas with marked suprasellar extension was particularly impressive; therefore, we do not suggest preoperative bromocriptine treatment in this type of tumor. Two of 14 patients operated on by the transcranial route died after surgery, whereas there was no operative mortality in the 31 patients operated on by the transsphenoidal route. It proved advantageous to operate as early as possible, even during the acute phase of pituitary apoplexy. The transsphenoidal approach gave the best results, but to achieve satisfactory late results multidisciplinary treatment was necessary, namely, postoperative radiotherapy in 23 patients, bromocriptine in 12, and endocrine replacement therapy in almost all. In an average follow-up period of 6.2 years, 5 (11.1%) symptomatic recurrences were observed.

text: Diagnostic efficiency of troponin T measurements in acute myocardial infarction BACKGROUND. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of a newly developed troponin T enzyme immunoassay for the detection of acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. The study comprised 388 patients admitted with chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction and 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and additional suspected myocardial cell damage. Troponin T was elevated to more than twice the analytical sensitivity of the assay (0.5 microgram/l) in all patients with non-Q wave (range, 1.2-5 micrograms/l) and Q wave infarction (range, 3-220 micrograms/l). Troponin T appeared in serum as early as 3 hours after onset of pain in 50% of the patients and remained elevated in all patients for more than 130 hours, revealing release kinetics of both free cytosolic and structurally bound molecules. The diagnostic efficiency of troponin T was superior to that of creatine kinase-MB (98% versus 97%) and remained at 98% until 5.5 days after admission, if patients with unstable angina were excluded from analysis. In the 79 patients with unstable angina, troponin T was elevated (range, 0.55-3.1 micrograms/l) in at least one blood sample from each of 37 patients (56%). Circulating troponin T was correlated to the presence of reversible ST segment or T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (p less than 0.005) and to the frequency of in-hospital complications. In the 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and suspected additional cardiac muscle damage, troponin T was the most useful test; its efficiency was 89% or 94% (depending on the discriminator value used) as compared with 63% for creatine kinase-MB. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, the data of the study indicate that the newly developed troponin T test improves the efficiency of serodiagnostic tools for the detection of myocardial cell necrosis

text: Mild hypothermic intervention after graded ischemic stress in rats. We investigated the effect of mild (34 degrees C) postischemic hypothermia on hippocampal neuronal damage in 43 rats as a function of the duration of forebrain ischemia. Two temperatures and two durations were investigated. In two normothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 15) and 12 (n = 10) minutes, respectively. In two hypothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 9) and 12 (n = 9) minutes, respectively, and was followed immediately by the lowering and maintenance of rectal temperature to 34 degrees C for 2 hours. Seven days after the ischemic insult, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were prepared for histologic analysis; the percentage of necrotic neurons among the total neuronal population in selected CA1/2 sectors of the hippocampus was determined. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of necrotic neurons in the central (77.5% versus 55.5%, p = 0.006) and lateral (62.5% versus 38.9%, p=0.005) areas and in the overall CA1/2 sector of the hippocampus (71.8% versus 52.2%, p = 0.008) for the 8-minute hypothermic group compared with the 8-minute normothermic group. In contrast, no differences were detected in any area of the hippocampus between the 12-minute normothermic and the 12-minute hypothermic groups (p = 0.29-0.49). Our data indicate that mild postischemic whole-body hypothermia ameliorates neuronal survival when ischemia lasts 8 minutes but not 12 minutes.

text: A controlled trial of early adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia remains a common cause of serious morbidity and mortality in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The extensive lung injury that accompanies pneumocystis-associated respiratory failure and the reports of clinical benefit from the use of adjunctive corticosteroids provided the rationale for this prospective multicenter trial. METHODS. A total of 333 patients with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia received standard treatment and were randomly assigned to receive either corticosteroids (beginning with the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone twice daily) or no additional therapy. The primary end points in this unblinded trial were the occurrence of respiratory failure (hypoxemia ratio [partial pressure of arterial oxygen divided by fraction of inspired oxygen] less than 75, intubation, or death), death, and dose-limiting toxicity of the initial standard therapy. RESULTS. Of the patients with confirmed or presumed pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 225 and n = 26, respectively), those assigned to treatment with corticosteroids had a lower cumulative risk at 31 days of respiratory failure (0.14 vs. 0.30, P = 0.004) and of death (0.11 vs. 0.23, P = 0.009), as well as a lower risk of death within 84 days (0.16 vs. 0.26, P = 0.026). The frequency of dose-limiting toxicity of the standard therapy was similar in the two treatment groups. Intention-to-treat analyses of the entire cohort confirmed these findings. Clinical benefit could not be demonstrated, however, for patients with mild disease (hypoxemia ratio, greater than 350), equivalent to a partial pressure of oxygen greater than 75 torr on room air. The patients assigned to corticosteroid treatment had an excess

text: Sequential gradient pneumatic compression enhances venous ulcer healing: a randomized trial. The treatment of venous ulcers has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The application of properly applied graduated compression bandages, the use of graduated compression stockings, and surgery have been shown to achieve healing. However, some ulcers persist despite appropriate management. A randomized study was undertaken to compare two regimens of treatment for such patients. Both regimens included ulcer debridement, cleaning, nonadherent dressing, and graduated compression stockings. In one regimen, sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for 4 hours each day. Only one of 24 patients in the control group had complete healing of all ulcers compared with 10 of 21 patients healed in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The median rate of ulcer healing in the control group was 2.1% area per week compared to 19.8% area per week in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The results indicate that sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression is beneficial in the treatment of venous ulcers.

text: Cereal-based oral rehydration therapy. I. Clinical studies. Studies of ""improved"" oral rehydration solutions, in which glucose polymers (starch) derived from rice or other cereals were added to improve cotransport of sodium and to promote sodium and water absorption, have been reported. These solutions were administered to decrease diarrhea volume and duration, reduce vomiting, and replace volume loss in stools. In clinical trials of children and adults with high-output diarrhea, such as in cases of cholera, the use of cereal-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS) compared with glucose-based ORS produced significant (20% to 53%) reductions in stool volumes. In one study the duration of diarrhea was shortened by 30%. In noncholera diarrhea in children, cereal-based ORS was as effective as glucose-based ORS. Although the amino acid transport systems were intact in patients with cholera, the addition of glycine to glucose-based or rice-based ORS did not reduce stool volume or duration of diarrhea. The exception was alanine, which reduced stool output and ORS requirements. More research is needed to determine the optimal mix of starch, amino acids, oligopeptides, and proteins that would utilize the absorptive active transport systems maximally to reduce fluid losses and duration of diarrhea.

text: Multilevel transneuronal degeneration after brain damage. Behavioral events and effects of anticonvulsant gamma-aminobutyric acid-related drugs. Recent morphologic and behavioral studies of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid agents on transsynaptic degeneration after cortical and striatal damage are reviewed and discussed. Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, mild atrophy appears in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Long-term diazepam administration greatly enhances this degeneration, extends the degeneration into the thalamus, and severely disrupts recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Following unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, progressive degeneration of neurons occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and efferent targets in the thalamus. This degeneration can be prevented by chronic infusion of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist. Unexpectedly, this treatment did not facilitate recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Recovery in muscimol-treated animals was impaired relative to saline-treated controls. Thus, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists either may enhance or prevent neural atrophy secondary to brain damage, but the behavioral outcome appears to depend importantly on the excitatory and inhibitory characteristics of the affected networks.

text: Site and strand specificity of UVB mutagenesis in the SUP4-o gene of yeast [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 1;88(5):2035] DNA sequencing was used to characterize 208 mutations induced in the SUP4-o tRNA gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by UVB (285-320 nm) radiation. The results were compared to those for an analysis of 211 SUP4-o mutations induced by 254-nm UVC light. In each case, greater than 90% of the mutations were single base-pair changes but G.C----A.T transitions predominated and accounted for more of the mutations induced by UVB than UVC. Double substitutions, single base-pair deletions, and more complex events were also recovered. However, UVB induced 3-fold more tandem substitutions than UVC and nontandem double events were detected only after irradiation with UVC. Virtually all induced substitutions occurred at sites where the pyrimidine of the base pair was part of a dipyrimidine sequence. Although the site specificities were consistent with roles for cyclobutane dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone(6-4) lesions in mutation induction, preliminary photoreactivation data implicated cyclobutane dimers as the major form of premutational DNA damage for both agents. Intriguingly, there was a preference for both UVB- and UVC-induced mutations to occur at sites where the dipyrimidine was on the transcribed strand.

text: Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection. Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen. Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl. Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats. We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury.

text: Amyloidosis associated bleeding diatheses in the surgical patient. The coagulopathies associated with amyloidosis have not been widely appreciated. We encountered a patient with amyloidosis and mildly abnormal coagulation studies who presented for an emergency laparotomy for acute bowel obstruction. Upon gentle manipulation of the bowel, an unexpected bleeding diathesis was manifested by the formation of several large haematomas resulting in a large amount of blood loss (approximately 800 ml). Numerous defects of platelet function and coagulation have been associated with amyloidosis, including abnormal platelet aggregation, increased vascular fragility, factor IX and X deficiencies, decreased levels of alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, and increased levels of plasminogen. Intraoperative therapy for our patient included the rapid administration of four units of fresh frozen plasma and ten units of platelet concentrate.

The incidence of well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas was the same in the elderly patients, whereas the latter was dominant in the young patients. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding location, size, macroscopic patterns, extent of lymph metastases, or stage classification. The rates of preoperative surgical risk factors were significantly different between the two groups (p less than 0.01): 90.0% for the elderly and 34.9% for the young patients. However, the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality were 31.7% and 3.3% for the elderly and 24.1% and 1.3% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. The 5- and 10-year survival rates after curative total gastrectomy were 48.6% and 23.2% for the elderly compared with 49.4% and 33.6% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. A 5-year survival rate after noncurative operation was 0% for the elderly and 6.4% for the young patients. These results indicate that, when performed for cure, total gastrectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy can provide good long-term results for elderly, as well as young, patients.

text: The effect of adjunctive arteriovenous fistula on prosthetic graft patency: a controlled study in a canine model. Bilateral 6 mm PTFE grafts were placed from the external iliac artery to the femoral artery with ligation of the intervening segment of the iliofemoral artery in 14 dogs. An arteriovenous fistula was constructed at the distal anastomosis on one randomly selected side in each animal while the contralateral graft served as a control. Graft follow-up ranged between 8 and 12 months in all animals. Serial arteriography was performed to confirm graft and fistula patency and demonstrated persistence of antegrade flow into the arterial tree distal to all patent bypasses. Femoral intraarterial pressures distal to patent grafts were identical on both sides in each animal throughout the study. Cumulative life-table patency rates showed higher patency for the arteriovenous fistula bypasses than the control grafts at all time intervals: 71% vs. 57% at 3 months, 48% vs. 25% at 6 months, and 40% vs. 22% at 12 months, respectively. This is the first controlled study that provides experimental evidence suggesting that these bypasses may produce increased patency of prosthetic arterial grafts and lends support to their use in a clinical, prospective, randomized study.

text: Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair.

text: Variable expression of Parkinson's disease: a base-line analysis of the DATATOP cohort. The Parkinson Study Group. The DATATOP database, which includes clinical information on 800 patients with early untreated Parkinson's disease (PD), is well suited to explore clinical heterogeneity in PD. Patients with early-onset PD (less than or equal to 40 years, N = 33) reached the same level of disability as the late-onset PD (greater than or equal to 70 years, N = 85) group at a significantly slower rate (2.9 vs. 1.7 years). Early-onset PD patients functioned cognitively better than late-onset PD patients. Bradykinesia, and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), were more common at onset in patients with a rapid rate of disease progression (""malignant PD""; duration of symptoms less than 1 year and Hoehn/Yahr stage of 2.5, N = 11) as compared with those with a relatively slow rate of progression (""benign PD""; duration of symptoms greater than 4 years, N = 65). Comparisons of tremor-dominant PD (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score less than or equal to 1.5, N = 441) with the PIGD-dominant type (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score greater than or equal to 1.0, N = 233) provided support for the existence of clinical subtypes. The PIGD group reported significantly greater subjective intellectual, motor, and occupational impairment than the tremor group. Stage II patients had higher depression scores than stage I patients. Among the patients participating in the DATATOP, older age at onset with bradykinesia, or with the PIGD form of PD, is associated with more functional disability than when the symptoms are dominated by tremor or begin at a younger age.

text: Follow-up recatheterization after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. The results of recatheterization were assessed in a select group of 95 patients enrolled in the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry to determine whether any procedural or patient-related variables at baseline predicted either initial immediate or follow-up (6.2 +/- 3.3 months) results. At the follow-up catheterization, 39 (41%) of the patients were in improved condition and 56 patients (59%) had recurrence of symptoms, allowing for analysis of the effect of the procedure in two symptomatic patient subsets. In the total group the aortic valve area increased initially from 0.56 +/- 0.16 to 0.87 +/- 0.27 cm2 but partial return to the baseline valve area was evident at follow-up (0.63 +/- 0.25 cm2). Similarly, the mean aortic gradient initially decreased from 72 +/- 30 to 35 +/- 16 mm Hg but then increased to 55 +/- 25 mm Hg at follow-up. Neither the initial nor the late hemodynamic results appeared affected by any definable procedural variable at the time of valvuloplasty, including the maximal diameter of balloons, number of balloons simultaneously used, mean inflation time or total number of inflations. Such technical concerns also did not seem to affect short- or long-term outcome. Similarly, no baseline hemodynamic variable clearly separated those who became increasingly symptomatic from those whose condition was improved at the 6 month interval. At recatheterization, a reduction in the aortic valve area toward baseline was observed in 24 (62%) of the 39 improved patients and in 45 (80%) of the 56 who were symptomatic.

text: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cough. Prevalence in an outpatient medical clinic population. To determine the frequency of ACE inhibitor cough in an outpatient medical clinic population, a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey using mailed questionnaires was done. Patients were randomly selected from a computerized hospital pharmacy data base. The overall prevalence of cough was 19 percent in the ACE inhibitor groups compared with 9 percent in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group. The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00). This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group. Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor. Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors.

text: Leiomyosarcoma of the sinonasal tract. A clinicopathologic study of nine cases. The clinicopathologic features of nine cases of sinonasal tract leiomyosarcoma (SNTL) referred to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, during the period from 1970 through 1988 are described. This report represents the largest study to date on SNTL, and our results are compared with the 21 previously reported cases of SNTL. Of the nine cases described, patients ranged in age from 22 to 86 years (mean, 55 years). The most frequent clinical presentation was nasal obstruction unilaterally. The neoplasms were limited solely to the nasal cavity in four cases (44%) and involved both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in the remaining five cases. Light microscopic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural features served to characterize these tumors as malignant neoplasms of smooth-muscle origin. In contrast with previous studies, immunocytochemistry was employed to differentiate SNTL from other spindle cell malignancies of the region, using newly available monoclonal antibodies to smooth-muscle antigens. Treatment was surgical. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy did not appear to affect the progression of the disease. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the aggressiveness of SNTL and morphologic parameters (eg, mitotic count and tumor size). Instead, prognosis was dependent on the distribution of disease at presentation. Of all 30 patients with SNTL described to date, 10 had the neoplasm confined solely to the nasal cavity. The 10 neoplasms did not recur. We conclude that SNTL may best be regarded as a locally aggressive neoplasm with only limited metastatic potential and that it could be curable by complete surgical excision.

text: The oncologic risks of skin preservation at mastectomy when combined with immediate reconstruction of the breast. Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast. There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin. Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence. To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied. Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances. All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months. One peripheral local recurrence was observed. This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients.

A total of 143 patients with superficial G2 (pTa, pT1) bladder cancer (48 G2pTa; 95 G2pT1) presenting between 1970 through 1987 were reviewed. Of 48 patients with G2pTa followed for up to eighteen years, G3 recurrence developed only in 1 (2.0%), and invasive cancer (greater than pT2) developed only in 2 (4.2%). They both received radiotherapy and have responded completely. There have been no cancer-related deaths. In contrast, in the 95 patients in whom the basement membrane had been breached (pT1), higher grade tumor (G3) developed in 11 (11.5%), and 15 (16%) had recurrences with invasion of muscle (greater than pT2). Among these there were 7 (7.3%) cancer-related deaths.

text: Cerebral glucose utilization during sleep in Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a PET study. Three right-handed male children (aged 5, 6, and 11 years) with signs, symptoms and/or history of the syndrome of acquired aphasia-epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) were studied during drug-induced, electroencephalographically (EEG)-monitored sleep by positron-emission tomography (PET) and the [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) method. Our data demonstrate that in Landau-Kleffner syndrome, cerebral glucose utilization is not normal during sleep. The metabolic pattern varied between the children but the metabolic disturbances always predominated over the temporal lobes. They were right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral. In the two first patients, EEG recordings showed continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep and a right-greater-than-left asymmetry was observed in temporal areas. In patient 1, the asymmetry was associated with a relative increase of glucose utilization of the right posterior temporal region. In patient 2, the glucose utilization was relatively decreased in the left anterotemporal and left perisylvian regions. In patient 3, the sleep EEG showed no discharge and no significant asymmetry was observed; however, glucose utilization of both temporal lobes was decreased. Lower metabolic rates in subcortical structures than in cortex were also noted in the three children. This metabolic pattern may be related to the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS).

text: Effect of age on the efficacy of blood pressure treatment strategies. To study whether the proportion of excess cardiovascular events attributable to various levels of systolic blood pressure varies with age, we calculated the population-attributable risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), and stroke incidence due to systolic blood pressure in men and women 45 years of age or older in the United States during 1980. Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort. We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events. At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg). With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons. The pattern is similar for men and women. The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach.

text: The effect of glucose administration on carbohydrate metabolism after head injury. The role of intravenous infusion of glucose in limiting ketogenesis and the effect of glucose on cerebral metabolism following severe head injury were studied in 21 comatose patients. The patients were randomly assigned to alimentation with or without glucose. Systemic protein wasting, arterial concentrations of energy substrates, and cerebral metabolism of these energy substrates were monitored for 5 days postinjury. Both groups were in negative nitrogen balance, and had wasting of systemic proteins despite substantial protein intake. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentrations were highest on Day 1, but remained higher than normal fasting levels on all days of study, even in the patients who received no exogenous glucose. Although there were no differences in blood or CSF glucose concentrations in the two groups of patients, the glucose group had higher plasma insulin levels, with a mean +/- standard deviation of 14.8 +/- 7.3 microU/ml compared to 10.3 +/- 4.2 microU/ml in the saline group. The blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, glycerol, and the free fatty acids were higher in the saline group than in the glucose group. Cerebral oxygen consumption was similar in the two groups, while the cerebral metabolism of glucose and of the ketone bodies was dependent on whether glucose was administered. In the glucose group, glucose was the only energy substrate utilized by the brain. In the saline group, the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate replaced glucose to the extent of 16% of the brain's total energy production. Cerebral lactate production and CSF lactate concentration were lower in the saline group. These studies suggest that administration of glucose during the early recovery period of severe head injury is a major cause of suppressed ketogenesis, and may increase production of lactic acid by the traumatized brain by limiting the availability of nonglycolytic energy substrates.

text: Human cerebral malaria: association with erythrocyte rosetting and lack of anti-rosetting antibodies. Plasmodium falciparum isolates from 24 Gambian children with cerebral malaria and 57 children with mild forms of the disease were assessed for their ability to form erythrocyte rosettes. All isolates from the children with cerebral malaria were able to form rosettes, whereas those from children with mild forms of the disease did not form rosettes, or had a significantly lower rosetting rate. Plasma of children with cerebral malaria lacked anti-rosetting activity, whereas plasma of children with mild disease could often disrupt rosettes in vitro. A monoclonal antibody to P falciparum histidine rich protein (PfHRP1/KP/KAHRP) disrupted rosettes of many of the isolates in vitro indicating that the rosetting ligand is relatively conserved compared with ligands associated with endothelial cytoadherence. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that erythrocyte rosetting contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and suggest that anti-rosetting antibodies protect against cerebral disease.

text: Colonic glycoproteins in monozygotic twins with inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic glycoprotein composition was evaluated in monozygotic twins with inflammatory bowel disease using ion-exchange chromatography. Fifty-three individuals, 12 pairs and 1 single twin with ulcerative colitis and 14 pairs with Crohn's disease, were evaluated. Seven twin pairs were concordant for the presence of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, whereas twin siblings of 10 ulcerative colitis probands and 9 Crohn's disease probands were not known to have inflammatory bowel disease. Content of one chromatographically defined component of colonic mucin, designated HCM species IV, was reduced in both patients with ulcerative colitis (1040 +/- 300 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) and their apparently healthy twins (1340 +/- 540 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) compared with control subjects (4030 +/- 1,000 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM). Composition of mucin in Crohn's disease patients and their nonaffected twins was not significantly different than in controls. These observations suggest that altered profiles of mucin glycoprotein may be present before the onset of ulcerative colitis and may be genetically defined. Conversely, it appears that alterations in glycoproteins only are not sufficient to initiate mucosal inflammation.

text: Immunotherapy. Neuroblastoma as a model. Combinations of aggressive therapy and radiotherapy directed at the primary tumor site as well as dose intensive chemotherapy against metastases can effectively induce complete remissions in patients with stage IV neuroblastomas. By virtue of its tumor specificity, the use of immunotherapy at the time when microscopic residual disease is present holds great promise in eradicating the tumors permanently. Monoclonal antibodies can accumulate selectively and at high concentrations in neuroblastomas. They have the potential of initiating complement activation and inflammation at the tumor site. Hematopoietic factors and cytokines can reinforce the body with tumoricidal leukocytes. Ex vivo activation of autologous white cells as well as arming by genetic manipulation can also produce tumor-seeking vehicles that may be therapeutically useful. As the knowledge of tumor and host immunobiology accumulates, the optimal combination of these approaches will become apparent.

text: Primary CT diagnosis of abdominal masses in a PACS environment Whether the display medium--film versus cathode ray tube (CRT)--affects observer performance during interpretation of computed tomographic (CT) images is an important research issue in these times of implementation and growth of picture archiving and communications systems in radiology. The authors performed a multiobserver receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study to determine the performance of radiologists who read abdominal CT studies displayed on film, as well as on a high-resolution workstation (video monitor) that made use of three different display modes. A total of 166 examinations were evaluated by eight radiologists, who recorded their ordinal confidence ratings of the demonstration of presence or absence of abdominal masses. ROC analysis showed small differences in the confidence ratings assigned by individual readers for the detection and interpretation tasks. Results for the group as a whole showed no significant reduction or improvement in observer performance when ratings for any one of the workstation display modes were analyzed. The results of this study demonstrate that current CRT display technology is adequate for enabling the primary detection of abdominal masses with CT examinations.

text: Mechanical lithotripsy of common duct stones. Over the past 8 years we have utilized various types of mechanical lithotriptors to crush common bile duct stones. The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%. However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time. During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place. A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective. We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones.

text: Alterations in opioid parameters in the hypothalamus of rats with estradiol-induced polycystic ovarian disease. The distribution and density of selectively labeled mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid binding sites were examined by in vitro radioautography in the hypothalamus of normal, estradiol valerate (EV)-injected, and estradiol (E2)-implanted female rats. Hypothalamic beta-endorphin concentration was also examined by RIA in these three groups of animals. Quantitative analysis of film radioautographs demonstrated a selective increase in mu-opioid binding in the medial preoptic area of EV-treated, but not of E2-implanted rats. However, both these estrogenized groups exhibited a reduction in the density of delta-opioid binding in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Statistically significant changes between either estrogenized groups were not observed for kappa-opioid binding. Results on the hypothalamic concentration of beta-endorphin indicated a marked reduction in EV-injected animals with respect to controls. In contrast, the E2-implanted animals exhibited beta-endorphin concentrations similar to controls. The present results confirm the increase in opioid receptor binding previously reported in the hypothalamus of EV-treated rats and further demonstrate that this increase is confined to the medial preoptic area and exclusively concerns mu-opioid receptors. The concomitant reduction in beta-endorphin levels observed in the same group of animals suggests that the observed increase in mu-opioid binding could reflect a chronic up-regulation of the receptor in response to compromised beta-endorphin input. Given the restriction of this effect to the site of origin of LHRH neurons and the demonstrated inhibitory role of opioids on LHRH release, it is tempting to postulate that such up-regulation could lead to the suppression of the plasma LH pattern that characterizes polycystic ovarian disease in the EV-treated rat.

text: Nutrient modulation of inflammatory and immune function. The metabolic response to injury occurs after a diverse group of surgical injuries including major surgical intervention, shock, infection, and sources of inflammation such as pancreatitis. The response is mediated by the macroendocrine system, the autonomic nervous system, and the cell-cell communication system. The clinical manifestations include now well-described clinical, physiologic, and metabolic characteristics. The approach of aggressive source control, invasive circulatory resuscitation, and nutrition/metabolic support has been associated with an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. In those patients who do not respond to this approach, the disease process progresses to multiple organ failure syndrome with its associated high mortality. Altering the route of feeding, preventing single nutrient and generalized nutrient deficiency, and reducing nosocomial infections with selective gut decontamination have not significantly altered the course or outcome of the disease process in this latter group of patients with persistent hypermetabolism. The available data support the position that this persistent hypermetabolism represents abnormal metabolic regulation resulting in persistence of the inflammatory response with associated suppression of the immune defenses. A number of research approaches are being taken to understand and modulate this abnormal state of regulation. Because of the role of specific nutrients in these regulatory processes, beyond their role in classic nutrition support, nutrients such as arginine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and RNA are being evaluated for their ability to modulate inflammation and to improve immune function. Preliminary results are encouraging.

text: Immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of postoperative recoarctation in infants and children. The purpose of this article is to present immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of aortic recoarctations following previous surgery in infants and children. During a 45-month period that ended in June 1989, nine infants and children, ages 6 months to 7 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of recoarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 52 +/- 20 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 16 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 3.4 +/- 1.4 mm to 6.1 +/- 1.6 mm (p less than 0.01). None required surgical intervention. There were no significant complications. Follow-up catheterization (16 +/- 7 months) data in six children and follow-up clinical (17 +/- 6 months) data in all children were available for review. Both the residual coarctation pressure gradient (6 +/- 6 mm Hg) and coarctation segment size (8.2 +/- 2.4 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.001) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values and the pressure gradient fell further (p less than 0.01) when compared with that measured immediately after balloon angioplasty. None developed restenosis, although one child required surgical relief of severe narrowing of isthmus of the aortic arch. None developed aneurysms. On the basis of this experience and that reported in the literature and because of high morbidity and mortality rates associated with repeat surgery for postoperative recoarctation, we recommend balloon angioplasty as the procedure of choice for relief of postoperative recoarctation with significant hypertension.

text: Measurement of resistance versus flow in assessing efficiency of aortocoronary bypass grafts. Measurement of flow in saphenous bypass grafts with an electromagnetic flowmeter is complicated and poorly reproducible. Since coronary flow is largely dependent on variable factors the stable value of resistance seems more appropriate for comparison. A simple method has been developed for intraoperative measurement of resistance in the respective coronary bed. Pressure is recorded in the saphenous graft by an electromanometer during continuous flushing with known amounts of blood, and resistance is calculated instantaneously. The procedure is very simple and takes less than one minute. The quality of the saphenous vein itself can be assessed simultaneously by the same method. Resistances were measured during coronary surgery in over 500 saphenous grafts. The results were highly reproducible and comparable. Excellent flows can be expected if resistance is below 200 Peripheral Resistance Units (PRU); if this is over 800 PRU flow is very poor.

Part of this suggestion rests on epidemiological evidence, and part rests on work done in cellular and animal systems. In this article, the experimental evidence for carotenoid inhibition of mutagenicity, malignant transformation, tumor formation, and immunoenhancement is reviewed. Although a mechanism for these effects cannot yet be identified, it is clear that the overwhelming evidence in these systems would indicate that carotenoids exert an important influence in modulating the actions of carcinogens.

text: What practicing physicians in North Carolina rate as their most challenging geriatric medicine concerns. We recently surveyed a random sample of 500 physicians in family practice, general practice, and internal medicine in North Carolina, to discover their most challenging geriatric concerns. Using a three-stage survey technique, respondents were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the most challenging geriatric problems they face and what specific geriatric content areas would attract their participation in an educational program. They were then asked to rank 34 topics on which they would like more information. A total of 242 responses were received for a 55% response rate (63 of the 500 were undeliverable). Responses indicated that physicians are more concerned with management than diagnosis and revealed considerable evidence of empathy and concern. The top three topics had to do with the management of dementia, multiple problems, and depression. Approximately 25% of physicians consider problems of financing health care as among the most challenging problems.

Although thrombasthenia is a rare disorder, its occurrence is increased in some regions of the world where intracommunity marriage and consanguinity are commonplace, resulting in increased expression of autosomal recessive traits. We have been studying two populations having an unusually high frequency of Glanzmann disease, Iraqi Jews and Arabs living in Israel, and were able to distinguish the populations on the basis of immunodetectable GPIIIa and platelet surface vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) expression. In this article, we describe molecular genetic studies based on use of the PCR that have allowed us to characterize platelet mRNA sequences encoding GPIIb and GPIIIa from patients in these populations. In six of six Iraqi-Jewish families studied, cDNA sequence analysis identified an 11-base deletion within exon 12 of the GPIIIa gene. This mutation produces a frameshift leading to protein termination shortly before the transmembrane domain of GPIIIa. In contrast, a 13-base deletion encompassing the splice acceptor site of exon 4 of the GPIIb gene was found in three of five Arab kindreds studied. This deletion results in forced alternative splicing to a downstream AG acceptor, producing a 6-amino acid deletion in the GPIIb protein, including a single cysteine residue. These nucleotide sequence variations were exploited to design a rapid, PCR-based oligonucleotide dot-blot hybridization test for both pre- and postnatal diagnosis of Glanzmann disease. These studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of Glanz

text: A plasma protease which is expressed during supramaximal stimulation causes in vitro subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes in rat exocrine pancreas. The complex events by which digestive enzyme zymogens and lysosomal hydrolases are segregated from each other and differentially transported to their respective membrane-bound intracellular organelles in the pancreas have been noted to be disturbed during the early stages of several models of experimental pancreatitis. As a result, lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B are redistributed to the subcellular zymogen granule-rich fraction and lysosomal hydrolases as well as digestive enzyme zymogens are colocalized within large cytoplasmic vacuoles. The current study was designed to create an in vitro system that would reproduce this redistribution phenomenon. Our results indicate that cathepsin B redistribution occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with a supramaximally stimulating concentration of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein along with plasma from an animal subjected to in vivo supramaximal caerulein stimulation. Neither the plasma nor a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein, alone, is sufficient to induce in vitro cathepsin B redistribution. The ability of the plasma to induce in vitro cathepsin redistribution is dependent upon its content of a 10,000-30,000-D protein and is lost by exposure to protease inhibitors. In vitro cathepsin B redistribution also occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with plasma obtained from opossums with hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis caused by bile/pancreatic duct ligation.

text: Racial differences in the anterior circulation in cerebrovascular disease. How much can be explained by risk factors? The entry characteristics of 1367 patients enrolled into the Extracranial/Intracranial Bypass Study were examined to determine if site differences in intracranial and extracranial arterial lesions among racial groups could be explained by differences in risk factors. Blacks were more often hypertensive, diabetic, or cigarette smokers, while whites had higher systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin values. Orientals had the lowest prevalence of vascular risk factors. Despite these differences in risk factors, multivariate analysis showed race to be an independent and strong predictor of the location of cerebrovascular lesions. To our knowledge, this study is unique in documenting risk factors prospectively and systematically in three racial groups simultaneously. Although generalization is limited by possible biases related to patient selection, the results affirm previous tentative conclusions about the role of race in determining the location of cerebrovascular disease.

text: Pain on common bile duct injection during ERCP: does it indicate sphincter of Oddi dysfunction? The reproduction of a patient's biliary-type pain upon initial injection of contrast material into the common bile duct during diagnostic ERCP is a dramatic experience for both patient and physician. The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP. Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated. We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection. There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes. Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

text: Nebulized albuterol in acute bronchiolitis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 infants between 6 weeks and 24 months of age who had a first episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive either nebulized albuterol (0.15 mg/kg/dose) or placebo (saline solution) for two administrations 1 hour apart. The albuterol therapy resulted in a significantly greater improvement in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.70 vs decreases 0.30; p = 0.03), oxygen saturation (increases 0.71% vs decreases 0.47%; p = 0.01) after one dose, and in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.86 vs decreases 0.37; p = 0.02), respiratory rate (decreases 19.6% vs decreases 8.0%; p = 0.016), and oxygen saturation (increases 0.76% vs decreases 0.79%; p = 0.015) after two doses of the drug. The response to therapy was similar in infants younger and those older than 6 months of age. The heart rate rose slightly more in the albuterol group (increases 7.76 from baseline) versus the placebo group (decreases 6.79). There were no other side effects of the treatment. Of the 34 children from whom nasal specimens were obtained by swab for viral identification, 24 had positive test results (21 for respiratory syncytial virus, 1 for parainfluenza, 1 for paramyxovirus, and 1 for influenza A). We conclude that nebulized albuterol constitutes a safe and effective treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.

text: Effects of vasopressin on portal pressure during hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Vasopressin is often used to treat variceal hemorrhage. However, its efficacy is uncertain, and its portal hemodynamic effects in this setting are unknown. Eleven patients with alcoholic liver disease and bleeding varices were given vasopressin (0.2 U/min for the first hour, then 0.4 U/min for 24 hours). Portal pressure was monitored using an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter. Seventeen patients with variceal bleeding who remained stable over 26 hours of initial treatment with crystalloid and blood products served as a comparison group. Vasopressin infusion (0.2 U/min) produced a significant decrease in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient (wedged minus free hepatic venous pressure), and heart rate. Increases in the rate of infusion did not produce further decreases in the parameters measured, but the changes were sustained over the course of the infusion. Hemodynamics remained stable in the control group. Portal pressure did not increase when vasopressin was abruptly discontinued in the 3 patients in whom postinfusion measurements were made. Vasopressin retains its portal hypotensive effects in the setting of variceal hemorrhage. Tachyphylaxis does not develop over 26 hours, and a ""rebound"" increase in portal pressure probably does not occur when the infusion is discontinued.

text: Glutathione S-transferase. Novel vaccine against Fasciola hepatica infection in sheep. The potential of GST as a vaccine candidate against liver fluke infection in ruminants was studied by vaccinating sheep (n = 9) with GST purified from adult worms of Fasciola hepatica and challenging with 500 F. hepatica metacercariae. The immunization induced a high antibody response to GST in contrast to the poor or undetectable response to this Ag observed in naturally infected sheep. Throughout the trial, the progress of the fluke infection was monitored by measuring RBC hemoglobin levels, the extent of liver damage and the fecal egg output in the sheep. This analysis indicated that a subpopulation (n = 4) of the GST vaccinated animals exhibited no anemia, reduced liver damage and a lower mean fecal egg count relative to the infected control group suggesting a lower fluke burden in these animals. Worm burdens in the livers of the GST vaccine group (107 +/- 22) were 57% lower than in the infected control group (250 +/- 25). The subpopulation of the GST vaccine group demonstrated a 78% reduction in mean worm burdens relative to the control group. These results show that GST of adult F. hepatica is a novel Ag that can significantly protect sheep against liver fluke infection. The results suggest that the immune response to GST is directed to the juvenile worm reducing the number of worms that can establish in the liver of the vaccinated animals.

text: Clinical features of adenovirus enteritis: a review of 127 cases. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 127 hospitalized pediatric patients whose fecal samples were positive for adenovirus (Ad) by electron microscopy during an 18-month period. Serotyping results obtained by microneutralization tests and restriction endonuclease analysis were available for 105 of 127 cases. There were 69 males and 58 females and 94% of patients were less than 4 years of age. The average body temperature was 38 degrees C rectal (range, 36.2-40.8 degrees C) with an average duration of fever of 1.6 days. The average duration of clinical illness was 8.8 days (range, 1 to 32 days). Although Ad 40 and Ad 41 were isolated in the majority of cases (59 of 105 (56%], Ad 31 was associated with 18 of 105 cases (17%). Of the 18 cases associated with Ad 31, 14 were nosocomial and associated with diarrhea. Our survey confirms the importance of fastidious enteric Ad in infantile diarrhea (Ad 40, Ad 41) and suggests that Ad 31 produces a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from that caused by Ad 40 and Ad 41. The occurrence of Ad enteritis in patients admitted for unrelated illnesses well after initial hospitalization suggests that Ad is also an important cause of nosocomial enteritis in our hospital.

text: Effects of 1.32-micron Nd-YAG laser on brain thermal and histological experimental data. Considering that the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser should have physicothermal properties close to those of the CO2 laser, a series of experiments were conducted on rat cortex (N = 51). Three laser wavelengths were compared: CO2 laser (10.6 microns), 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, and 1.32-microns Nd-YAG lasers. For each shot, temperature measurements were recorded with an infrared thermographic videocamera. The digitized signals were figured as thermal profiles and temperature developments. Ninety-five shots were correctly studied and analyzed: CO2, N = 29; 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, N = 20; 1.32-microns Nd-YAG, N = 46. The histological lesions produced by these three lasers were compared on animals killed 24 hours (N = 20), 8 days (N = 20), and 30 days (N = 5) after the laser impacts. For equivalent densities of energy, the depth of cortical necrosis was comparable for the CO2 laser (200-250 microns) and the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser (210-260 microns) whatever the date of death; the 1.06-microns Nd-YAG laser shots were responsible for much more important damage (400-550 microns). Because of its important absorption in water and nervous tissue, the authors consider the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser most suitable for neurosurgery, particularly because it is conducted through optic fibers, and therefore is easy to handle during neurosurgical procedures.

text: Human hepatic regenerative stimulator substance: partial purification and biological characterization of hepatic stimulator substance from human fetal liver cells. Current support or replacement therapies for fulminant acute hepatic failure are frequently very disappointing. In this study, human hepatic stimulator substance--a liver-specific growth factor--was partially purified from human fetal liver cells and characterized by its biological effects. Almost 70-fold protein content was purified with an approximately 80-fold increase in specific growth stimulator activity. Human hepatic stimulator substance proved to be heat-stable, protease-sensitive, organ-specific and species-nonspecific. Human hepatic stimulator substance produced a two- to threefold increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA when injected intraperitoneally into growing weanling mice (nonhepatectomized) or regenerating rats (34% hepatectomy). The effects of hHSS in reversing the lethality of D-galactosamine (1.6 gm/kg body weight)-induced hepatic necrosis in rats were further evaluated. A survival rate of 4% (n = 24), 41% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 33% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 31% (n = 13, p less than 0.05) and 18% (n = 11, p greater than 0.05) was observed when the rats were injected with 4 ml of saline intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human intact fetal hepatocytes (2.4 x 10(8] intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human hepatic stimulator substance intraperitoneally, 2 ml of twofold concentrated human hepatic stimulator substance intravenously and 1 ml of fourfold human hepatic stimulator substance intramuscularly, respectively, 20 hr after poisoning.

text: Evaluation of ketotifen in corticosteroid-dependent idiopathic anaphylaxis. To study the possible efficacy of ketotifen (K) in the treatment of idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA), K was administered in an open-label trial to six patients with IA who required corticosteroids at doses below which their disease could not be controlled. During the study, patients continued to receive noncorticosteroid medications (eg, antihistamines, oral adrenergic agents) that had been used on a regular basis for treatment of IA before study, but periodic attempts to reduce corticosteroid doses were made. A reduction of prednisone dose with continued control of disease was judged to be evidence for a beneficial effect of K. After 7 to 16 months of K administration, three patients were judged to have had probable benefits from K (reductions in alternate day prednisone dose requirement from 40 mg to none, 35 mg to 15 mg, and 30 mg to none), and one patient had a possible benefit from K (dose reduction from 100 to 120 mg to 77 mg). Two other patients were unable to tolerate major decreases in prednisone without developing symptoms or signs of IA. Within the limitations of this study design, we conclude that K may be efficacious in the treatment of some patients with IA, and that further trials of K in the treatment of IA are indicated.

text: Outpatient management of schizophrenia. As effective antipsychotic pharmacotherapy has become available, patients with schizophrenia are increasingly managed in an outpatient setting by primary care physicians. Pharmacotherapy is generally effective in treating ""positive,"" or psychotic, symptoms and lessening the risks of relapse, but ineffective in improving ""negative,"" or deficit, symptoms. Aggressive attempts to totally control positive symptoms and to ameliorate negative symptoms tend to increase side effects and may be detrimental to the patient. Intensive psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are generally unproductive. Attempting to obtain a cure is unrealistic. A moderate approach is recommended, taking into consideration the limitations of existing treatments, achieving control of extreme symptoms and minimizing social and occupational limitations.

text: Disability from bicycle-related injuries in children. Bicycle crashes are a major cause of injuries in childhood. The goal of this study was to determine the long-term disabilities caused by bicycle-related injuries, and to clarify the long-term treatment priorities of injured children. Hospital records of 372 children (ages 2-15 yr, median 9 yr; 232 boys and 140 girls) admitted with bicycle-related injuries from 1979 through 1986 provided clinical information, social service visits, in-hospital and outpatient rehabilitative interventions, and physical status at discharge. More complete evaluations were made by contacting parents by telephone (82 children), and by personal interview and physical examinations (27). Head injuries predominated (69.1%). Twelve (3.2%) died, all from major head injuries. Four suffered permanent severe impairment from cervical spinal injuries and head injuries and remain institutionalized (1.4%). One third had a persistent disability noted at the time of discharge in the medical record (33.6%), reported by telephone interview (31.7%), or confirmed by physical examination (37.0%). Still, only 11.0% received physical therapy consultations during hospitalization, and 22.8% received social service assistance. Only 39.0% were seen by a surgeon or pediatrician after discharge, and few (7.3%) received outpatient physical therapy. Cognitive or behavior changes were noted in 31.7%, many noting changes in school performance (worse in 20.7%), behavior (13.4%), and sleep, particularly nightmares (34.1%). Recurrent injuries occurred in 52 children (14.4%), of whom ten (2.8%) required further hospital admission. Bicycle-related injuries cause significant short- and long-term disabilities among children.

text: History of cigarette smoking and risk of leukemia and myeloma: results from the Adventist health study. The risks of leukemia and myeloma associated with cigarette smoking were evaluated in a cohort study of 34,000 Seventh-day Adventists. Although Seventh-day Adventists do not smoke by church proscription, many are adult converts who smoked cigarettes prior to their baptism into the church. In comparison with those who never smoked, ex-smokers experience a relative risk of 2.00 (95% confidence interval = 1.01-3.95) for leukemia and 3.01 (95% confidence interval = 1.13-8.05) for myeloma. Risks increased in a dose-response fashion with increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked daily for both leukemia (trend P =.009) and myeloma (trend P =.005). Also, the risks of both leukemia and myeloma increased with the total duration of cigarette smoking. The cigarette smoking-leukemia relationship was strongest for myeloid leukemia, for which ex-smokers experienced a relative risk of 2.24 (95% confidence interval = 0.91-5.53). These data lend support to the hypothesis that cigarette smoke may induce malignant degeneration in bone marrow and its products.

text: Simian virus 40 small tumor antigen and an amino-terminal domain of large tumor antigen share a common transforming function. The 82-residue amino-terminal sequences of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (TAg) and small tumor antigen (tAg) are identical. Genetic analysis of TAg lacking amino acids 1-82 revealed that it was transformation-defective, as revealed by the agar growth assay, except when introduced in the presence of tAg. Since the latter, alone, lacks overt transforming activity, it would appear that the function of the sequence common to TAg and tAg is necessary, but not sufficient, for TAg transforming activity and that tAg can provide that function or its equivalent in trans. Thus, tAg may, in part, be viewed as a ""portable"" copy of a TAg functional domain.

text: Stages of T-cell receptor protein expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study five monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to T-cell receptor (TCR) proteins (WT31, alpha F1, beta F1, TCR delta-1 and delta TCS-1) were used to identify discrete maturative stages in 40 cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These MoAbs reacted exclusively with CD3+ T cells and did not label B-lineage and myeloid cells. In 17 of the 40 T-ALL cases studied the leukemic blasts lacked membrane and cytoplasmic TCR chains (group I). In 12 cases cells did not have membrane CD3/TCR but expressed cytoplasmic TCR proteins heterogenously: nine cases had cytoplasmic TCR beta chains (beta F1+, alpha F1-; group II), one case had cytoplasmic TCR alpha chains (alpha F1+, beta F1-; group III), and two cases were labeled by both alpha F1 and beta F1 MoAbs (group IV). The remaining 11 cases were mCD3+: nine were TCR alpha beta+ (group Va) and two exhibited TCR gamma delta (TCR delta-1+, delta TCS-1+; group Vb). The analysis of the TCR beta, -gamma, and -delta gene configurations in 23 of the 40 T-ALLs showed that: (1) the lack of TCR protein expression was due to the lack of TCR gene rearrangements only in one of nine cases; (2) five of five TCR beta+, TCR alpha- cases studied had germline TCR alpha genes (ie, no detectable TCR delta gene deletions); (3) seven of eight cases with TCR delta gene deletions expressed TCR alpha proteins, whereas in 12 of 20 of the T-ALLs with TCR beta gene rearrangements the synthesis of the corresponding protein occurred; only 2 of 16 cases with rearranged TCR

text: Rural-urban differences in stage at diagnosis. Possible relationship to cancer screening. Stage at diagnosis was examined for various malignancies identifiable through screening to determine whether rural-urban differences exist in Georgia. Data were obtained from a population-based cancer registry which registers all incident cancers among residents of metropolitan Atlanta and ten neighboring rural counties. Black and white patients with a first primary invasive malignancy newly diagnosed between 1978 and 1985 were included in this study. Residents of the rural area were twice as likely to have unstaged cancers (18.3%) as were urban residents (9.6%). Among patients with known stage at diagnosis, rural patients tended to have more advanced disease than urban patients. The relative excess of nonlocalized malignancies in rural Georgia was 21% for whites and 37% for blacks. The rural excess of nonlocalized prostate cancer among blacks was especially pronounced. Differences in access to or utilization of early detection methods may contribute to the rural-urban differential in the extent of disease at diagnosis.

Patients older than 60 years and those with evidence of extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease were excluded. 84 patients had a cerebral ischaemic event, 50 patients had embolic events in an abdominal organ or limb, and 19 patients had acute retinal ischaemia. The transthoracic echocardiographic examination was normal in 92 patients (60%), whereas only 65 patients (42%) had normal findings after both transthoracic and transoesophageal examination (p less than 0.005). Intracardiac masses, including valvular vegetations, were found in 39 patients (25%), including 27% of patients with cerebral embolism and 32% of these with peripheral embolism, but in none of the patients with retinal ischaemia (p less than 0.001). 47 patients (31%) had valvular disease, 10 (7%) had wall motion abnormalities, 23 (15%) had abnormalities of the interatrial septum, and 9 patients (6%) had diseases of the thoracic aorta. Cardiovascular abnormalities were frequently found by echocardiography in patients with arterial emboli.

text: Predicting the appropriate use of carotid endarterectomy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and coronary angiography BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In a nationally representative population 65 years of age or older, we have demonstrated that about one quarter of coronary angiographies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and two thirds of carotid endarterectomies were performed for reasons that were less than medically appropriate. In this paper we examine whether specific characteristics of patients (age, sex, and race), physicians (age, board-certification status, and experience with the procedure), or hospitals (teaching status, profit-making status, and size) predict whether a procedure will be performed appropriately. RESULTS. In general, we found that little of the variability in the appropriateness of care (4 percent or less) could be explained on the basis of standard, easily obtainable data about the patient, the physician, or the hospital. For all three procedures, however, performance in a teaching hospital increased the likelihood that the reasons would be medically appropriate (P = 0.09 for angiography, P = 0.30 for endoscopy, and P less than 0.01 for endarterectomy). In addition, angiographies were more often performed for appropriate reasons in older or more affluent patients (P less than 0.01 for both). Being treated by a surgeon who performed a high rather than a low number of procedures decreased the likelihood of an appropriate endarterectomy by one third, from 40 to 28 percent (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Appropriateness of care cannot be closely predicted from many easily determined characteristics of patients, physicians, or hospitals. Thus, for the present, if appropriateness is to be improved it will have to be assessed directly at the level of each patient, hospital, and physician.

text: Status of sex steroid hormone receptors in large bowel cancer. To determine the potential role of sex steroid hormones in the development of colorectal tumors in humans, specific androgen (AR), estrogen (ER), and progesterone (PGR) receptors were investigated in normal mucosa (NM) and in tumor (T) paired biopsy specimens from 94 patients. Androgen receptors were detected in 98% and 96% of NM and T samples, ER in 91% and 83% of NM and T biopsy samples, whereas PGR were detected only in 14% and 10% of NM and T specimens, respectively. These incidences are independent of the sex and age of the patients. They are not related to tumor localization, histologic grade, or stages of Dukes' classification. Scatchard analysis of labeled ligand binding indicated the existence of one single class of high affinity binding sites; the calculated dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.7 +/- 0.6 10(-9) molar concentration (M) for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 0.6 +/- 0.3 10(-9) M for estradiol (E2). These values were identical in NM and T tissue for both AR and ER. The binding capacity for DHT was 148 +/- 67 and 93 +/- 43 fmol/mg of cytosol protein in NM and T tissues, respectively (P less than 0.05). The ER content was lower and similar in NM and T biopsy specimens: 19 +/- 9 and 18 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The PGR content was 10 +/- 4 in NM versus 17.5 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein in T specimens. It is observed that the elevated AR in normal mucosa is not related to any known function for androgens in the digestive tract. The receptor pattern observed in tumors does not support the hypothesis previously raised in the case of chemically induced colonic tumors in

text: Treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head by drilling and muscle-pedicle bone grafting. Sixty-one patients with 68 osteonecrotic femoral heads, at different stages of development, were treated surgically; their average age was 36 years. Necrosis followed a fracture in 43 hips and traumatic dislocation in three. It was idiopathic in 14, cortisone-induced in seven and associated with gout in one. The operation of multiple drilling, curettage of the necrotic bone and muscle pedicle bone grafting was performed in all. Cheilectomy of the superolateral part of the femoral head and adductor tenotomy were added in cases of advanced necrosis. Of the several types of muscle pedicle used, tensor fasciae latae anteriorly and quadratus femoris posteriorly were preferred. Full weight-bearing was not permitted for five to six months. The follow-up period varied from three to 12 years. Hip pain was regularly relieved and abduction and rotation of the joints were improved. Those with post-traumatic or idiopathic necrosis did better than those with cortisone-induced necrosis.

text: Enalapril-associated anemia in renal transplant recipients treated for hypertension. We encountered a renal transplant recipient who developed an unexplained 0.09 decrease in hematocrit value while taking enalapril for hypertension, which reversed when the drug was stopped. This experience, and a previous similar case report, prompted a review of all our 27 transplant patients treated with enalapril. Of these, 10 patients (37%) had developed an otherwise unaccounted for anemia: the pre-enalapril hematocrit value was 0.42 +/- 0.01 and it decreased to the nadir value of 0.33 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) within 12.3 +/- 0.9 weeks after initiation of 9 +/- 2.4 mg of enalapril daily; enalapril was stopped in seven patients and their anemia resolved within 9.1 +/- 0.7 weeks to a final hematocrit value of 0.40 +/- 0.01. The remaining three patients were maintained on enalapril at their physicians' discretion, without further decrease in hematocrit values. No appreciable changes in drug regimens, clinical course, or other laboratory parameters were noted during this period. A causal relationship between enalapril and anemia was suggested by the effect of drug withdrawal and rechallenge on hematocrit in one of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between those patients who did (group I) and those who did not (group II) develop enalapril-associated anemia, with the exception of a normal hematocrit value of 0.42 +/- 0.01 in group I versus a lower hematocrit value of 0.36 +/- 0.02 in group II (P less than 0.05). We conclude that enalapril should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia following renal transplantation. Susceptibility to this effect might emanate from the immunosuppressed state.

text: Treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with intermittent high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide PURPOSE: Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity. This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP (""pulse"" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis. GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive. Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months. If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter. Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health). RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy. Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated

text: Geriatric diabetic nephropathy: an analysis of renal referral in patients age 60 or older. We report a series of 33 consecutive hospitalized geriatric diabetic patients who were referred for evaluation of diabetic nephropathy, defined as proteinuria greater than or equal to 1 g/d (1,000 mg/24 h) or a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 177 mumol/d (greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL). The study population was 60 years old or older (mean age, 68 +/- 6 years), was comprised mainly of women (24 of 33, 72.7%), and was predominantly black (25 of 33, 75.8%). All patients had type II diabetes. A family history of diabetes in parent or sibling was elicited in 24 (72.7%) patients. There were eight patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and 25 with less severe nephropathy (mean proteinuria, 2.7 g/d [2,700 mg/24 h]; mean creatinine clearance, 0.57 mL-s [34 mL/min]). Cardiac disorders were noted in the majority of patients: congestive failure in 20 (60.6%), myocardial infarction in eight (24.2%), and active angina in five (15.2%). Other comorbid diseases were present in both hemodialysis patients and the subset of nondialyzed azotemic-proteinuric patients, and consisted of peripheral neuropathy in 31 (93.9%), gastroparesis in 16 (48.5%), retinopathy in 28 (84.8%), and legal blindness in 11 (33%). We conclude that geriatric diabetic nephropathy in type II diabetes is similar in presentation and severity of comorbid extrarenal complications to the syndrome described in younger adults. This inference must be tempered by both the small size and the limitation imposed by the demographics of the study population, which is predominantly composed of black patients receiving treatment at inner city hospitals.

text: Cerebral atrophy in habitual cocaine abusers: a planimetric CT study. We compared cranial CTs of 35 habitual cocaine abusers, 16 self-reported 1st-time users, and 54 headache patients using linear planimetric measures. All patients met the following criteria: age 20 to 40 years, no polydrug abuse (including alcohol), HIV seronegativity, normal albumin level, and no history of any other neurologic disease. The sex ratios and ages were not significantly different in the 3 groups. The planimetric measurements and calculated indices of cerebral atrophy were significantly different in the habitual cocaine abusers compared with the 2 other groups of patients. There were no differences between 1st-time cocaine users and controls. Among the habitual cocaine abusers there was a positive correlation between the approximate duration of cocaine abuse and the calculated atrophy indices. The findings suggest that cerebral atrophy develops in chronic cocaine abusers, and the severity correlates with the duration of abuse.

text: Interpleural analgesia improves pulmonary function after cholecystectomy. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interpleural bupivacaine on analgesia and ventilatory capacity after cholecystectomy. Forty-two patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups: one to receive interpleural administration of bupivacaine-adrenaline mixture (Group 1 = 22 patients) and the other standard administration of intramuscular meperidine (Group 2 = 20 patients) for postoperative pain relief. The intensity of pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively as well as at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. At the same time, FVC and FEV1.0 measurements were obtained for all patients. The group given interpleural bupivacaine had better pain relief with mean VAS of 0.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 1.4, 0.6 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 compared with 5.2 +/- 2.2, 5.8 +/- 2.7, 5.5 +/- 2.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.8 for patients receiving meperidine (P less than 0.001). The patients in Group 1 also had larger FVC and FEV than those in Group 2: FVC 22 +/- 14.5 per cent vs 32 +/- 15.2 per cent (P less than 0.005), FEV1.0 25 +/- 15.5 vs 38 +/- 14.8 per cent (P less than 0.001) (mean +/- SD). We conclude that the interpleural analgesia can achieve better pain relief with greater ventilatory capacity than a standard analgesic regimen in the first two days after cholecystectomy.

text: Effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature in normal dogs and in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bipyridines or their derivatives may have a selective pulmonary vasodilation effect. METHODS: Preliminary study: milrinone administration to 12 normal dogs (low dose [bolus 75 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.75 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]; high dose [bolus 150 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 1.5 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]). Main study: milrinone administration to 18 dogs with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary embolism induced by a massive injection of autologous muscle cubes. The pulmonary hypertension dogs were divided into three groups: a) group E (n = 6) received embolization only, as control; b) group L (n = 6) received low-dose milrinone; and c) group H (n = 6) received high-dose milrinone, equivalent to the preliminary study group. Hemodynamic measurements and blood samplings were obtained at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min after start of milrinone infusion. RESULTS: Milrinone did not change mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in normal dogs. Milrinone decreased MPAP significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance index remained at an almost constant level in normal dogs, but decreased significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level in all groups. High-dose milrinone administration decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) significantly; low-dose milrinone administration decreased SVRI slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone may have a selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect only in dogs with

text: Occurrence of hypercalcemia and leukocytosis with cachexia in a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla in athymic nude mice: a novel experimental model of three concomitant paraneoplastic syndromes. Hypercalcemia and leukocytosis may occur in conjunction as paraneoplastic syndromes associated with malignant disease. Here we describe a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla that was associated with hypercalcemia and leukocytosis, and also cachexia. The primary tumor was surgically removed and established in permanent cell culture. When either primary tumors or cultured tumor cells were inoculated into nude mice, the nude mice developed the same paraneoplastic syndromes as those which occurred in the patient from whom the tumor was originally derived. The plasma calcium was increased two and one-half-fold and the WBC count 30-fold, and the body weight was decreased by 45% in tumor-bearing animals. Each of these paraneoplastic syndromes was alleviated by surgical excision of the tumor, indicating that the paraneoplastic syndromes were due to a factor or factors produced by the primary tumor. The development of each of these paraneoplastic syndromes in nude mice correlated positively with the other two syndromes. We examined the organs of tumor-bearing mice and found striking histopathologic abnormalities in the bones, spleen, and liver, but no infiltration with tumor cells. The bones showed marked evidence of osteoclastic bone resorption. This model of a human tumor associated with the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis paraneoplastic syndrome, together with cachexia, should make it possible to determine the mechanisms responsible for these paraneoplastic syndromes and their relationship to each other.

text: Acute biologic response to excimer versus thermal laser angioplasty in experimental atherosclerosis. Vascular injury and platelet accumulation after balloon angioplasty are two potentially important triggers of the process of restenosis that may be minimized by the use of laser energy to ablate atherosclerotic plaque. The type of laser most suitable to achieve these goals remains unknown. Accordingly, angiographic and histologic studies and quantitative platelet deposition analysis were performed on 27 atherosclerotic rabbit iliac arteries randomized to treatment with excimer laser or thermal laser angioplasty. Excimer laser angioplasty was achieved with 35 to 40 mJ/mm2 of 308 nm xenon chloride irradiation delivered through a 4.5F catheter made of 13 concentrically arranged 200 microns fiber optics, at a repetition rate of 25 to 30 Hz and a pulse duration of 135 ns; thermal laser angioplasty was achieved with a 1.7 mm metal probe heated with 10 W of continuous wave argon laser energy. The baseline and post-laser luminal diameters of excimer laser-treated vessels (0.92 +/- 0.28 and 1.56 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively) were similar to those observed in thermal laser-treated vessels (1.05 +/- 0.44 and 1.61 +/- 0.41 mm, respectively). Perforation occurred in 4 (29%) of 14 thermal laser-treated arteries and in 0 of 13 excimer laser-treated arteries (p = 0.04); spasm was observed in only 1 thermal laser-treated vessel. On the basis of a quantitative histologic grading scheme (damage scores of 0 to 4), greater degrees of injury were measured in thermal versus excimer laser-treated vessels (2.4 +/- 1.0 versus 1.3 +/- 0.4, p = 0.009).

text: Strategy for breakpoint cluster region analysis in chronic myelocytic leukemia in a routine clinical laboratory. Despite the increasing reliance on breakpoint cluster region (bcr) determinations in diagnosis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), few reports have dealt with the practical aspects of specimen analysis. In the setting of a routine molecular diagnostics laboratory, samples from 68 patients with active CML were evaluated for bcr rearrangements, with the use of a variety of enzymes and two probes. The data have been used to develop an efficient strategy for bcr screening and breakpoint determination. Screening with the universal bcr (UBCR) probe on Xba I and BgI II digests yielded bcr rearrangements in 100% of the Ph1-positive patients and three of the seven Ph1-negative patients, giving bcr analysis a sensitivity of 100%. A single-enzyme screen using the UBCR probe would have resulted in a false negative rate of 10%. The false negative rate was determined during the breakpoint site analysis from additional digests hybridized to both the 3' and UBCR probes. The false negative rate for the 3' probe was 26.5%, because of deletions or 5' rearrangements. The method of breakpoint site determination was dependent on screening results. In 78% of cases, one additional hybridization with two enzyme digests was required. During breakpoint site analysis, a rare false negative result was also demonstrated with Bam HI and Eco RI. This screening strategy has made bcr analysis competitive with cytogenetic analysis at the authors' institution; although turnaround time may be slightly longer, bcr analysis can yield information (such as detecting bcr-positive/Ph1-negative patients and determining breakpoint site) that cannot be obtained by cytogenetics.

Of the many causes, systemic infection and trauma are among the most common. History taking and physical examination should be careful and complete, because the results obtained help direct the laboratory evaluation. Diagnostic testing always begins with urinalysis but may progress to intravenous urography, voiding cystourethrography, endoscopic procedures in the upper and lower urinary tract, sonography, arteriography, or renal biopsy. Some cases remain unexplained and require follow-up to assess renal function.

text: Ultrastructural demonstration of peroxidase expression in acute unclassified leukemias: correlation to immunophenotype and treatment outcome. The lineage affinity of 57 cases of acute unclassified leukemias (AUL) was reevaluated by ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression (POEM) in combination with immunophenotyping and analysis of immunoglobulin gene configuration. Twenty-three cases of myeloid and three cases of megakaryocytic differentiation were identified by detection of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase (UMPO) and platelet peroxidase (UPPO). No significant correlation was noted between myeloid marker expression and POEM positivity, whereas presence of CD 19 or CD 24 antigen significantly correlated with POEM negativity (P =.001 and.023, respectively). Ig gene rearrangements including oligoclonal patterns were also recorded in 8 of 14 UMPO+ patients tested. Fourteen UMPO+ patients responded poorly to an ALL/AUL chemotherapy regimen with a low complete remission (CR) rate of 29% and a short median remission duration (MRD) of 5 months. The POEM- patients proved very heterogenous with respect to immunophenotype and Ig gene rearrangement. Seventeen of 21 patients tested had Ig gene rearrangements, including oligoclonal patterns. Combined data suggest that a proportion of these cases probably derive from a very immature lymphoid progenitor cell, particularly because 15 POEM- AUL patients showed a response to ALL/AUL chemotherapy comparable to that observed in patients with definitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CR rate 80%, MRD 20 months). Thus, ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression can provide decisive prognostic information in AUL patients.

text: Deletion of the human retinoblastoma gene in primary leukemias. As an initial step in evaluating the role of tumor suppressor genes in leukemogenesis, we surveyed primary leukemia cells from 130 patients for possible deletion of the retinoblastoma susceptibility (Rb) gene by Southern blot analysis. Two of them clearly showed homozygous deletion of Rb alleles. The first patient was a pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) associated with a cytogenetic translocation: t(14;16)(q24;q22). The deletion was located at the 3' portion of the Rb gene, very close to the site of Rb gene deletion recently identified in an ALL cell line. The absence of Rb110 protein was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The second patient was a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), terminated in acute blastic transformation. Deletion of the 5' portion of Rb gene was found in leukemic cells in the chronic stage. The results indicated that inactivation of the Rb gene occurred in certain cases of leukemia. Its significance warrants further study.

text: Chronic neutropenia. A new canine model induced by human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Normal dogs were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) at 10 micrograms/kg/day for 30 d, which caused an initial neutrophilia, followed by a prolonged period of chronic neutropenia. A control dog treated with recombinant canine G-CSF (rcG-CSF) showed persistent neutrophilia over 3 mo. Serum from dogs during neutropenia contained an antibody to rhG-CSF, which neutralized the stimulatory effects of both rhG-CSF and rcG-CSF on dog marrow neutrophilic progenitor cell growth and on NFS-60 cell proliferation. 4 mo after discontinuation of rhG-CSF, the dogs' neutrophil counts returned to the normal range. Rechallenge with the rhG-CSF re-induced severe neutropenia in 1 wk. Neutropenia was transferred by plasma infusion from a neutropenic dog to a previously normal dog. These data suggest that human rhG-CSF immunizes normal dogs and thereby induces neutralization of endogenous canine G-CSF and neutropenia. This model system should allow more precise definition of the in vivo role of G-CSF.

text: Raised urinary secretory IgA in chronic diarrhoea. Secretory IgA outputs in urine have been measured in 24 malnourished Gambian children who had been admitted to hospital with chronic diarrhoea and in 43 children from a rural Gambian village. Village children of poor nutritional state (less than or equal to 74% weight for age compared with the National Center for Health Statistics reference curve) had secretory IgA outputs that were only one third of those of better nourished individuals. In contrast, the patients with chronic diarrhoea had secretory IgA outputs that were significantly raised compared with village children, regardless of nutritional state. These results demonstrate that secretory IgA production in the urinary tract can be stimulated by intestinal disease, suggesting that malnourished children are able to mount a response to mucosal infection and supporting the hypothesis of a common secretory immune system.

text: Scanning acoustic microscopy of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous tissue specimens. Acoustic microscopy utilizes high frequency ultrasound to generate microscopic images. The current study was designed to examine representative disorders of the skin by use of a reflective scanning acoustic microscope (R-SAM), and to determine whether the obtainable resolution was sufficient to render a microscopic diagnosis. An Olympus UH3 Scanning Acoustic Microscope was utilized with lenses producing burst wave frequencies at 600 and 800 MHz (600 and 800 million cylces/sec). Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined. Acoustic images of unstained sections were compared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis. Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined. In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine. The advantages of the R-SAM include the capability of producing an acoustic profile of the tissue and the future possibility of in situ diagnosis.

text: The management of aneurysms and arterio-venous fistulae of the popliteal artery arising from war trauma. Emphasis on sigmoid operative approach. Between 1986-1988, 600 vascular cases arising from the Iran-Iraq conflict were dealt with within an 18 month period and 60 cases of popliteal artery and/or venous disruption were encountered presenting at variable times after injury. A policy of management between the forward and base hospital surgical teams was introduced, observing the following broad categorizations: (a) assessment/referral, (b) assessment/fasciotomy/referral, (c) immediate operation/referral for further operation/review/management. Two types of incision were used to enter the popliteal fossa: (a) a medial incision and (b) a sigmoid posterior incision (which we now favor). The results of this strategy of management and operative technique (when compared with our previous experience within the same time frame) suggested an improved outcome. Fifty-four out of 60 cases had a satisfactory operative result with below-knee amputation being required in only four cases and higher amputations in two others. No operative or postoperative deaths occurred. The implementation of this ""vetting policy"" at the front line appeared to reduce the number of amputations and assisted the clarification of management criteria in assessing limb viability at the forward hospital when a large number of casualties were being received. Operative access using the sigmoid posterior incision was not associated with any complications, offered better exposure than the medial incision and was technically easier for the surgeon to perform.

text: Syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast. Four cases are reported of syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast occurring in women aged 37 to 70 years. The lesions were characterized histologically by relatively well-circumscribed tumor-like nodules composed of a proliferation of teardrop or comma-shaped islands of squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelial islands contained central lumens lined by eosinophilic cuticles and were surrounded by a densely cellular fibrous matrix, thus closely resembling the growth pattern of dermal eccrine syringomas. The lesions appeared to arise de novo from breast parenchyma without evidence of transitions with the surrounding normal or hyperplastic mammary epithelium and were not associated with the overlying skin or nipple epidermis. In all cases, the surrounding breast tissue showed fibrocystic and benign proliferative changes, and in one case, the lesion was found in the vicinity of a large cyst surrounded by microcalcifications. All patients were treated by local surgical excision and have shown no evidence of recurrence over a follow-up period of 1 to 6 years. The histologic differential diagnosis and the possible pathogenesis of these lesions are discussed.

text: Enteric neuronal autoantibodies in pseudoobstruction with small-cell lung carcinoma. Severe gastrointestinal dysmotility is a newly recognized paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs with small-cell lung carcinoma. Thirty-four patients with small-cell carcinoma, of whom 5 had chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction and 29 had no digestive symptoms, were studied serologically. Four of the 5 patients with gut dysmotility had immunoglobulin G antibodies reactive with neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of jejunum and stomach in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies of this type were not found in any of the 29 patients who had no gut dysmotility, nor were they found in patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 8), ovarian cancer (n = 20), or epilepsy (n = 4) or in normal subjects (n = 9). In 4 of the patients with paraneoplastic pseudoobstruction, antibodies in highly diluted serum (1:4000-1:8000) bound selectively to nuclei and cytoplasm of neuronal elements in the gut. This novel autoantibody activity suggests that intestinal pseudoobstruction occurring in patients with small-cell carcinoma may have an autoimmune basis. From a clinical standpoint, serological testing offers a simple means for determining which patients with gut dysmotility syndromes may have associated small-cell carcinoma, thereby enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment of the tumor.

text: Aortic regurgitation after left ventricular myotomy and myectomy. Five hundred twenty-five patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent left ventricular myotomy and myectomy (LVMM) from 1960 to 1990. Four hundred ninety-six had nonregurgitant trileaflet aortic valves before LVMM. In 19 (4%) of these patients, aortic regurgitation developed after LVMM. Age of the 19 patients ranged from 10 to 58 years (mean age, 35 +/- 3 [+/- standard error of the mean]]. Seven were male and 12, female. Five patients underwent LVMM followed immediately by aortic valve replacement or valvuloplasty. Aortic regurgitation developed in 14 patients at a later date. The average New York Heart Association functional class improved from 3.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05, Student's t test) after operation. The average peak systolic left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and with provocation decreased from 65 +/- 8 to 14 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 108 +/- 9 to 45 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, 6 to 8 months after operation. Aortic regurgitation occurred in 7 of the 14 patients at 6 months or less after operation, and 3 required operative repair. In the other 7 patients, aortic regurgitation developed 3 years or more after LVMM, and 3 of them also required operative repair. All 12 patients in whom aortic regurgitation developed at operation or within 6 months postoperatively had either a very small aortic annulus (less than or equal to 21 mm, 5 patients), a low mitral-septal contact lesion (greater than or equal to 35 mm below the aortic annulus, 3 patients), or both (4 patients).

text: Treatment of complicated prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis with annular abscess formation by homograft aortic root replacement. The outcome of 30 consecutive patients with active aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis and root abscesses treated by the technique of homograft aortic root replacement with reimplantation of the coronary arteries is detailed. The principles of this technique are the removal of all abscesses and infected areas likely to drain into the infected mediastinum, excision of infected tissues down to healthy noninfected tissue and replacement with an antibiotic-impregnated homograft aortic root. All patients had evidence of progressive cardiac failure and ongoing sepsis. Mean patient age (+/- SD) at the time of operation was 42 +/- 18 years. The mean number of previous aortic valve replacements per patient was 1.6 +/- 0.7; 14 patients (47%) had undergone greater than or equal to 2 previous replacements. At operation, aortic root abscesses were found in all patients; abscess extension to adjacent structures and partial valve dehiscence had occurred in 23. In-hospital death occurred in 9 (30%) of the 30 patients. The 21 hospital survivors have been followed up for a mean of 66 +/- 42 months (range 9 to 144). Overall, 17 (81%) of the 21 hospital survivors have remained free of major adverse events (recurrence of endocarditis, need for reoperation or death). The results of our study suggest that homograft aortic root replacement should be considered favorably in the treatment of patients with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis and root abscesses.

Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln. Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance. David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show. Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn. Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction and consolidation with the capital

text: Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba ""All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less."" Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell. OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.

text: Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request. ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have."" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. ""The best way to lower

text: Dart Group Corp> said it told Supermarkets General Corp SGL> it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. ""We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms,"" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said

text: The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers.

text: The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been set yet, industry sources said. Production prices, the basis for setting intervention prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said. Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values, the sources added. In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers. The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market. The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is 1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760. They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market. Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices, they said.

text: Sony Corp SNE.T> group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference. Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end. Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said. The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct. The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad. The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said. Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.

text: The U.S. civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor Department said. The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February. The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline. The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a decline last June of 75,000, the department said. Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct level in March, 1986. Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in recent months, with the gains concentrated in service industries. The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March, while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in March. Business and health services showed the largest gains in jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000. The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0 hours in February, the department said. Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6. The department's survey of households showed the number of unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln. The number of persons working part time for economic reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February. The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19 mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal adjustment, the department said. Mining employment was little changed in March and has not experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986. Other service

text: Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis. A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships. On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices. There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras. The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade."" The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct. Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling. Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitib

He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did not agree with existing policy, ""We'll take a look at it."" The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic Policy Council. Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.

text: The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said. Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies ""can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."" He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald ""an era of greater exchange rate stability."" The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level. ""At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen,"" Gleske said. He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary. But ""a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value,"" he said. In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said. First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses. Second, in the United States, it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said. Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, ""both within countries and between them."" For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest

text: Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"" one official told. ""We would very much like to do something to respond to that."" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further

text: A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share. In comments at a news conference of Vontobel Holding AG>, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks' own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board, to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in. A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers. Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems. ""We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said. Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies, worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares. However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z> to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company's statutes. Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament. ""People buying, for example, more than five pct of a company's shares should be made to declare their purchase,"" he said.

text: Continental Illinois Corp's CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. ""I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt,"" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. ""I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess,"" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.

In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also talking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG SALG.H> on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs. This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original plans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks with the government in Bonn. Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000. The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to diversify into high-technology areas and away from its previous reliance on steel and pipe-making. More A spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office later said the anti-cartel authorities would probably rule on the takeover in the new few weeks.

In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5 pct decline in annual earnings per share. Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest on last month, on non-accrual status. ""None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might be going on,"" he said. First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in medium-to long-term loans to Brazil. It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs. First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade lines to Brazil. Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he finds, ""very disquieting and discomforting.""

text: Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased. A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash. Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday. The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid. Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened. The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean. Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement. Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.

text: The Australia based Ariadne Australia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine brewing firm, San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said. The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines. He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares. Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines. He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only offer in cash, the newspaper reported. Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares. The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut. Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties. The Manila newspaper

text: U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000. Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors. Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992. Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.

text: Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriate measures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be

text: The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said. The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985. Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet. The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985. Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers. Of them, some 18,000 clients cla&#127;imed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said. Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list. They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and n&#127;earby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said. To&#127;&#127;day's arre&#127;st came a&#127;&#127;fter narly two years of joint&#127; investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who &#127;had questioned about 3,000 of&#127;&#127; the firm's former employees&#127;, police

text: &#2; ZIMBABWE MAIZE HARVEST LOWER AFTER BUMPER CROPS HARARE, March 3 - Zimbabwe's maize crop in 1986/87 (April/ March) is likely to be slightly over 1.6 mln tonnes, against 1.83 mln in 1985/86, Grain Marketing Board figures show. Maize exports for 1986/87 to January 31, 1987 totalled 315,000 tonnes, with about a further 40,000 tonnes expected to be exported in February and March, against 285,000 tonnes in 1985/86. Domestic usage is estimated at 650,000-900,000 tonnes, depending on how other crops are affected by current poor rains. Last year's consumption was around 700,000 tonnes. Zimbabwe has around two mln stonnes of surplus maize in storage, accumulated after two years of bumper harvests. &#3;

text: Rockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results, despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments, President Donald Beall told. Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. ""It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share,"" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. ""I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts,"" Beall said, adding, ""long-term, we have a very serious problem."" In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

text: The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,"" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

text: The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate

text: Allegheny International Inc, which has agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the company. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the company and its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company prior to the buyout. The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability to attract other offers or take other actions that would benefit holders of preferred stock. The complaint also alleges federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary duty. The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the pending offer being made by Sunter Acquisition to acquire Allegheny. Sunter Acquisition Corp and Sunter Holdings Corp were formed by First Boston and Allegheny. Allegheny said it and the Sunter concerns intend to vigorously defend the complaint's charges. The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny's preferred stock.

text: About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at strike headquarters said today. The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27. The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound. He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships. The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime. While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable. ""It hasn't been critical by any means,"" said a coffee trader in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships. Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.

text: Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to

World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.

text: Central bankers said they were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels. Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which reviewed the agreement, they also welcomed interest rates cuts in France and today's drop in British rates. One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy. The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the IMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they discussed Brazil's debt moratorium. But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central banks.

The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said. Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.

text: U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC. ""This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market,"" Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter. ""I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal,"" Yeutter said. ""It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks),"" he said.

text: Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said. Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group PAC.N> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network. ""C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures,"" said Wa

This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower ""marginal"" rate, analysts said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.

text: Diversified investment company, Ariadne Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper reported. The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week. ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised."" San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines. Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.

text: up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said. They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. ""the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic,"" president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told. ""we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared,"" he said. Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead. So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said. Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: ""the number of dead and injured is not known... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."" Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district.

text: An investment group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to acquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a share. The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended the offer until April three, from March 20. The group said it added several conditions to its offer, including receipt of all non-public information about Cyclops that was provided to Dixons Group PLC> in connection with Dixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops. Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops Dixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs. On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops' 4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company to 56 pct. Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until March 24. Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders ""will withdraw previously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to take advantage of Cyacq's higher offer."" The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of Dixons' tender offer. A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq. Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the U.K.-based firm would receive ""break-up fees"" or expenses from Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the Pittsburgh-based company.

text: Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting. Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel. ""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,"" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot. Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said. Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher. Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year. Monday's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower. Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are

text: Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements ""is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together."" The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC. Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31 billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985.

text: General Public Utilities Corp said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979. The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two. A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the progress of the cleanup and on other company operations. GPU said the dividend is of ""modest size,"" representing less than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the average electric utility. ""As the operating companies need to return to the capital markets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend to produce lower cost and better terms,"" the company said. The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April 24.

text: Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said. Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

text: Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new ""B"" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs. A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per ""B"" share, while the ""A"" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is ""a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance."" Keswick said the issue of new ""B"" shares will give the group ""the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring."" He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price. The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- Mandarin Oriental International Ltd>

text: The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said. ""We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing,"" said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations. U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement. But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes. ""If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,"" he said. Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system. ""We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy,"" he said. ""If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made."" Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates. He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week. Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums. He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease. The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices. When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea. He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied

text: Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F.

text: A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines. C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall. ""They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,"" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said. Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct decline since September 1985. The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added. Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said. Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries. John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall.

text: Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said. They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs. But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday. Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said. Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs, they added. A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs. Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions. Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion as expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank. ""Public company we are and public company we wish to stay,"" Henrion told the paper.

text: A Japanese businessman announced plans for a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc would be a core company. However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have. ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,"" Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."" He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm. ""The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,"" Watanabe said. Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups, one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's overseas telephone business. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts. A British source, who declined to be identified further, said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion. ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" the British source told. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening re

""I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply.

text: Allegheny Beverage Corp said it has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its foodservice unit, Service America Corp. The group includes senior management of Service America but no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said. The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America, it said. Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary. The company said the group's review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or, if made, accepted. Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of 1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said. He declined to identify the Service America officials in the acquisition group. On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit. Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985, operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines. Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated laundry services, building maintenance services and retail office and furniture operations. In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share, excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985, Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc PEP> for 160 mln dlrs. Including discontinued operations and the special item,

text: U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities. Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed on production. However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted. The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said. Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country. Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices. The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize. Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains. The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year. Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change. Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year. Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, you might've heard that Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was set to make a cameo on the May 12th episode of HBO's hit show. While it took the internet some time to potentially locate him, the result looks to be a satisfying one for any Bears fan. Kudos to Twitter for tracking him down so that we can revel in his inevitable downfall. From the looks of it, Rodgers might have appeared twice in two blink-and-you-miss-it moments, first as one of the Lannister archers.

text: Apparel retailers' earnings haven't been this bad since the Great Recession. Apparel retailers' earnings reports haven't been so disappointing since the Great Recession. Companies ranging from Gap to J.Jill to Canada Goose and Abercrombie & Fitch delivered disappointing earnings reports in recent days, casting blame on issues like cool and wet weather, weak traffic at malls, the wrong promotions in stores and overall product missteps for dragging on results. The bad news has sent those stocks, and the broader industry, tumbling. The S&P 500 Retail ETX (XRT) was down nearly 2% Friday afternoon and has fallen nearly 13% this month, putting it on pace for its worst month since Nov. 2008, when the XRT lost 20.25%. Apparel retailers' earnings, as a group, are down 24% for the first quarter of 2019, according to an analysis by Retail Metrics. The group had up until now been growing earnings since the third quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, apparel retailers' earnings climbed a whopping 26%. The last time the group's earnings were this bad was the first quarter of 2008, when they fell 40%, Retail Metrics said. ""These are all mall-based retailers experiencing traffic issues,"" Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins said. ""The consumer is holding up... sentiment numbers have been really high,"" he added. The problems arise when certain companies aren't investing in ways to drive customers to their stores and websites, while others are, he said. Walmart and Target both, for example, had upbeat fiscal first-quarter earnings reports, specifically calling attention to strengths in their apparel businesses. They've actually been investing in apparel, rolling out more of their own private labels for women's, men's and kids clothes. ""It's not that people are buying fewer clothes,"" CGP president Craig Johnson said. But they're not going the same places anymore. The biggest victims of changing tastes are the ""classic, women's, missy retailers,"" Johnson said companies like Chico's and Talbots. ""The demand for that product is a fraction of

text: Bruges, Belgium makes moves to restrict tourism. Visiting the famous Belfry may no longer be so simple, as Bruges is the latest European city to make moves regarding tourism restrictions. The Belgian city is a popular stop along European grand tours. Its historic city center was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2000, being cited as ""an outstanding example of a medieval historic settlement."" But popularity can come with challenges, especially in a place as compact as Bruges. Dirk De fauw, who was elected mayor of Bruges in 2018, is backing measures that will put some crowd controls on travelers in the city. Local newspaper Het Nieuwsblad reports that Bruges will no longer advertise or promote day trips to the city, and measures will be taken to cut back the number of cruise ships able to dock at Zeebrugge port. Currently, the port has room for five cruise ships at a time, but the number will be capped at two per day. Cruise companies will also be asked to dock during the week instead of on weekends, which will help spread the crowds out among more days. The tourism board will also end its advertising campaigns in other nearby cities like Brussels and Paris to limit the number of day trippers. Tourists who only visit for the day result in cities losing much-needed hotel revenue. ""We have to control the influx more if we don't want it to become a complete Disneyland here,"" De fauw said. At present, travelers outnumber residents of Bruges city center by about three to one. Bruges' recent decisions echo moves made in other cities around Europe that are coping with the effects of mass tourism. In Amsterdam, 270 km (168 miles) away, tourism authorities recently made the decision to relocate the famous ""I Amsterdam"" sign from the city center to further afield, as the sign had become popular on Instagram and other social media platforms. It's part of a bigger, concentrated move in the Netherlands to get its tens of millions of annual visitors to explore other parts of the country. Meanwhile, Rome has focused on banning specific tourist behaviors that lead to dirt, congestion

text: Rangers' Drew Smyly struggling in return from Tommy John surgery. After back-to-back injury-wrecked seasons in Seattle and Chicago, left-hander Drew Smyly joined the Rangers via trade with the Cubs last November. The transaction all but completed the teams' midsummer deal centering on southpaw Cole Hamels, and it was a bit of an eye-opener that the Cubs parted with Smyly. The 29-year-old has been a more-than-capable big leaguer for most of his career, after all, but the Cubs who wanted to cut unnecessary payroll deemed him and his $7M salary expendable. Smyly never threw a pitch for Chicago after it signed him to a two-year, $10M guarantee in December 2017. The Cubs' hope at the time was Smyly would eventually recover from the Tommy John surgery he underwent as a member of the Mariners in June 2017 and return to his past form. The Rangers had the same hope when they acquired Smyly, but the union between the two sides hasn't worked out to this point, as Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News explains. In his most recent start of the year, Smyly turned in 3 1/3 innings of seven-earned run, eight-hit ball and allowed three homers in a loss to the lowly Orioles on Tuesday. Smyly has now taken the ball 10 times (eight starts) with Texas, and most of his outings have been middling to poor. He's now running a 7.93 ERA/7.35 FIP with 8.79 K/9, 6.21 BB/9, a 27.3 percent groundball rate and a 20.3 percent home run-to-fly ball rate in 42 innings. Those numbers are a far cry from the production Smyly registered with the Tigers and Rays from 2014-16, a 77-start, 388-inning span in which he managed a 4.01 ERA/4.16 FIP with 8.58 K/9 and 2.55 BB/9.

text: University Of Minnesota Racial Discrimination Lawsuit Dismissed. MINNEAPOLIS, MN A lawsuit filed by nine University of Minnesota football players, claiming racial and gender discrimination, was dismissed by a U.S. District Court judge on Tuesday, according to reports. The lawsuit was filed by players involved in a 2016 investigation into sexual assault allegations. The players, all African-American, alleged ""racial and gender discrimination; intentional, willful, and malicious misconduct; and deliberate indifference"" by the university, as well as outgoing President Eric Kaler and Tina Marisam, director of the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, KSTP-TV reported. The players also claimed they were subject to ""extreme gender bias"" because of extensive media coverage, ""pressure to crack down on alleged sexual offenders"" and an ongoing investigation into the university's ""failure to properly address charges of sexual harassment by white men in the athletics department. In a 29-page order dismissing the case, Frank found no merit in the players' claims. The university had filed a motion to dismiss last November, saying they would ""vigorously defend"" the claims. However, U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank said the players offered ""no factual support for their allegations of disparate treatment"" they claimed were based on a ""assumption"" of a culture of sexual misconduct among male athletes at the University of Minnesota, the Star-Tribune reported. The lawsuit stemmed from an incident in September 2016 when a female student accused several Gopher football players of sexual assault. After a police investigation, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office declined to press criminal charges. However, 10 players were initially suspended, leading to a bowl game boycott and eventually a coaching change. Four players ultimately were expelled, one had his expulsion reduced to a one-year suspension and the rest were cleared of wrongdoing.

text: Duluth cop rescues 2-year-old trapped in van that rolled down hill. A toddler will have quite a story to tell one day, a tale that has a happy ending thanks to a Duluth Police officer and a bit of luck. Police Chief Mike Tusken details on the department's Facebook page how a minivan rolled down a steep hill Thursday afternoon and into a stand of trees. Inside was a two-year-old girl who was not belted in. The Star Tribune reports that 27-year-old Megan Newman had parked her minivan near her home and was in the process of taking her twins out of the vehicle after returning from a trip to the aquarium. Newman tried to get the key out of the ignition but found it was stuck. She grabbed her daughter Elena but fellow twin Bella was being ""a stinker"" and refusing to come out of the vann, according to her mom. Megan went to ask a neighbor for help. On a GoFundMe page set up to help with medical expenses related to the incident she describes what happened next. ""When my neighbor yelled ""your car is rolling down the hill!"" I felt my heart just stop. It didn't feel real. I bolted down the hill as fast as I could to get to my baby who was in the car unbuckled and I was waiting anxiously for them to get her out! She was miraculously ok!"" Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken Thursday about 5:30 PM, police closed Mesaba Avenue to investigate a traffic crash. A van with two toddlers inside was parked near Mesaba Avenue while the mother was removing them. The van rolls... Facebook Chief Tusken offered further details in his post, praising one of his officers who jumped in to help while on his way to work. ""The van rolls away with one of the toddlers inside and rolling into busy Mesaba Avenue traffic, striking a vehicle and lodging into the trees on the steep hillside below. The van was partially suspended in the trees above the ground."" That's when Officer Todd Simmons clocked in early, driving up

text: Minute Maid Park's most memorable: Jose Altuve's mad dash. 15th in a series As the Astros play their 20th season at Minute Maid Park, we are counting down the 20 most memorable games and/or moments in the ballpark's two decades. Today, we look back at No. 6: Jose Altuve's memorable dash around the bases to score the winning run in Game 2 of the 2017 American League championship series. When: Oct. 14, 2017 What: Game 2, ALCS Score: Astros 2, Yankees 1 Last postseason, Jose Altuve was visibly hobbled by a knee injury as he tried to help the Astros defend their World Series crown. The previous year, Altuve's legs sparked the Astros to one of the most pulsating victories in franchise history. After Dallas Keuchel shut out the Yankees for seven innings in a 2-1 win in Game 1, Justin Verlander took the mound for Game 2 and lived up to his Yankee-killer reputation, holding New York to one run in nine innings while striking out 13. However, the Astros only scored one run of their own, on a Carlos Correa homer that came close to fan interference (with a touching backstory of the fan involved). The game headed to the bottom of the ninth inning tied 1-1. With one out, Altuve singled against Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman. Correa then battled the hard-throwing lefthander to a full count before smoking a line drive to the gap in right-center field. Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge hit cutoff man Didi Gregorius at second base, but his relay to the plate was dropped by catcher Gary Sanchez. Altuve, running all the way from first and waved around by third-base coach Gary Pettis, slid in and touched his left hand on the plate for the winning run in one of the most electrifying finishes in team history. The Chronicle's David Barron dubbed it a ""Mad Dash at Minute Maid Park,"" a homage to the Cardinals' Enos

text: Lynch: With 256 days until next major, Tour needs to rethink cramped calendar. Winter is just a few short weeks away, and it's not even August yet. If you're like me - willing to watch even a member-guest from Royal Melbourne in the middle of the night if a network would air it - then the coming months stretch out like a long, bleak prison sentence. It's 256 days until Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player will hobble to the first tee at Augusta National and get golf's next major championship underway. But hey, as long as football fans can enjoy their early season games free from the distractions of other sports, right? The PGA Tour schedule was rejiggered this year to ensure the FedEx Cup playoffs are over by September, though fans may need a few more weeks to grasp the ridiculous numerology that will see the points leader begin the Tour Championship at 10-under par before a shot is hit. Thus the PGA Championship shifted from August to May, concluding the major season at Royal Portrush, about three weeks earlier than usual. That may not seem like much, but it means that golf's four most important championships were decided in a span of just 101 days. (It would be 129 days if we include the Players Championship, but while I've argued that it should be considered a major I'm omitting it from my calculations purely out of pettiness.) That's why Justin Rose became the first player to give the new schedule a thumbs down. ""It's too condensed,"" he said at Portrush.. ""As a professional in terms of trying to peak for something, the process that's involved in trying to do that can be detailed and it can be longer than a month."" The world No. 4 was not persuaded by the rationale for the changes. ""A major championship should be the things that are protected the most. That's how all of our careers ultimately are going to be measured,"" he said. ""Thirty, forty years ago there wasn

text: Police to mom charged with killing daughter: Sippy cup had enough fentanyl to 'kill two horses'. An Allegheny County prosecutor on Monday wrapped up her case against an East Hills mother charged with killing her toddler last year by giving the girl a sippy cup containing fentanyl. Assistant District Attorney Diana Page entered into evidence video of an interview from July between the mother, Jhenea Pratt, and a Pittsburgh police detective. In the video, Ms. Pratt repeatedly denied knowing anything about what happened to her daughter, 17-month-old Charlette Napper-Talley. In the video, Detective Michael Flynn told Ms. Pratt that the sippy cup had enough fentanyl in it to ""kill two horses."" The defense began presenting its case prior to the lunch break. Closing arguments before Common Pleas Court Judge Mark V. Tranquilli were expected to occur Monday afternoon. Ms. Pratt, who is charged with homicide and endangering the welfare of children, has been held in the Allegheny County Jail without bail since August. In April 2018, Pittsburgh police discovered a red liquid inside a pink sippy cup on Charlette's bed in her East Hills apartment after responding to a call just after 6 p.m. for a baby who wasn't breathing. Days after Charlette died in the hospital on April 5, 2018, the Allegheny County medical examiner's office received results from two tests. Both indicated the presence of fentanyl in the toddler's blood, as did another screening in May by an independent lab. The inside of the cup also tested positive for fentanyl, police said, and the medical examiner's office listed Charlette's death as a homicide due to fentanyl poisoning. Investigators said two people were in charge of Charlette on the day of her death Ms. Pratt and her boyfriend, identified in court paperwork as Albert Williams. Both Mr. Williams and Ms. Pratt denied using, transporting or storing heroin or fentanyl, police

text: InfoWars to Pay 'Pepe the Frog' Creator $15,000 to Settle Lawsuit. Fringe conspiracy-theory outlet InfoWars settled a lawsuit Monday over their use of cartoon character ""Pepe the Frog,"" paying $15,000 to Pepe's creator and promising never to use the cartoon again. Pepe a morose, previously apolitical character created by cartoonist Matt Furie was co-opted by far-right groups and Trump supporters during the 2016 election. Furie has since tried to regain control over the character's image, pursuing legal action against a series of websites. The InfoWars lawsuit, filed last year, centered on a poster sold by InfoWars featuring Pepe alongside Trumpworld personalities like Roger Stone, InfoWars founder Alex Jones, and pundits ""Diamond & Silk."" Before settling, InfoWars tried a novel legal strategy of suggesting, without evidence, that Furie had actually based Pepe on an Argentinian amphibian cartoon character named ""El Sapo Pepe."" But on Tuesday, InfoWars agreed to destroy all remaining copies of the poster, and pay back the $14,000 it made from the poster sales along with an additional $1,000. ""From our perspective, we got everything we wanted,"" said Louis Tompros, one of the attorneys representing Furie pro bono. Despite paying Furie $15,000, InfoWars also claimed vindication, describing the settlement as a ""strategic victory"" in a blog post. ""They would have made more money if they went and waitressed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for a few months,"" InfoWars attorney Robert Barnes said in a statement. ""So, the Pepe trial is over. We made our point."" Furie is donating the extra $1,000 to amphibian conservation group Save the Frogs. ""It's a charity dedicated to frog preservation,"" Tompros said.

text: Buttigieg responds to fatal police shooting. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg addressed the fatal police shooting of a black man in the Indiana city in a campaign email Thursday night. The man, Eric Logan, was killed Sunday by Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, who confronted Logan while responding to reports of a man breaking into cars. O'Neill has said Logan approached him with a knife, but he did not have his body camera on at the time of the shooting. ""While the case is still being investigated, we do know this: a South Bend family is enduring the crushing and inconsolable anguish that far too many Black and Latino families across the country have shared,"" Buttigieg wrote in the email. The 37-year-old mayor and presidential candidate went on to discuss the fraught dynamics of the case pertaining to relations between the police and black communities. ""Our city, and our nation, demands answers about the dynamic between our police officers and the communities they are sworn to protect,"" the email reads. ""All police work and all of American life takes place in the shadow of racism, which hurts everyone and everything it touches. Historic racism, present-day racism, and generational racism - they all secrete a kind of poison into the bloodstream of this country,"" he added. Logan's family said in a press conference Monday that he was on his way to his mother's house from a family gathering at the time of his death and had not been carrying a knife. In the email, Buttigieg pledged that regardless of the investigation's outcome, his office intended to seek feedback from community members to address such issues. ""In new ways, we will elicit community input on the policies that decide how the police department does its work - policies on body cameras, the use of force, and the prevention of bias - and we will empower community members to help shape how these policies are put into practice,"" the email states. Buttigieg said Thursday he is open to calls for an independent prosecutor to investigate the shooting. The shooting is currently under investigation by the St. Joseph'

Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith intends to ride Henry this season, according to the Titans' website. In December, Henry had 97 carries for 625 yards and eight touchdowns. That was the single most productive month that any NFL running back had last season. If Henry could sustain that level of production for 16 games, he'd have a 2,000-yard season. Henry, who is heading into the final year of his contract, is looking for a big year that will lead to a big payday.

Four elderly people trapped in a coastal Louisiana community that was cut off from rising water from Hurricane Barry have been rescued by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter. Another eight people who were also trapped on Isle de Jean Charles in Terrebonne Parish will have to be rescued by boat. Terrebonne Parish leaders called a voluntary evacuation order Friday for the low-lying areas, including Isle de Jean Charles. Isle de Jean Charles is a narrow stretch of land near the southern coast of Terrebonne Parish about 45 minutes from Houma, Louisiana. The Coast Guard says the only road into the community, Island Road, is impassible due to rising waters. Live Team Coverage The storm threatening the Louisiana coast has strengthened to a hurricane. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its 11 a.m. Saturday advisory that Barry had reached maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, with higher gusts. Hurricane-force winds were measured some 45 miles to the east of the storm's center, which was located 40 miles south of Lafayette, Louisiana. It was moving northwest at 6 mph. Weather forecasters said a hurricane warning is in effect for Intracoastal City to Grand Isle. Such a warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area.

text: Broncos, Chris Harris nearing deal. The Broncos and Chris Harris Jr. are ""extremely close"" to a new one-year deal, according to Mike Klis of 9News (on Twitter). With the final week of OTAs starting on Wednesday, both sides hoping to reach agreement today. Harris is set to earn $8.9M this year in salary and bonuses. Initially, Harris was pushing for more than $15M per year on a multi-year extension, but he has since backed down from that asking price. The Broncos are unwilling to tack additional years on to his pact, but they are apparently willing to give him a pay bump for 2019. Last year, the Broncos mollified Harris' extension request with a similar measure. A $3M incentive package got the job done in 2018, but one has to imagine that GM John Elway will have to give more this time around. Harris appeared in 12 games and posted three interceptions a year ago before suffering a fractured fibula in early December. Pro Football Focus graded Harris, who spent 58% of his time in the slot, as the third-best cornerback in the NFL.

As proof of a honeymoon period long-since ended, there was radio broadcaster Don Fischer warming up a packed ballroom of Indiana fans on Wednesday night. Or should we say... cooling off? While introducing Indiana's basketball coach, the ""voice of the Hoosiers"" ended up imploring them to give Archie Miller a chance. ""This guy didn't forget how to coach,"" Fischer told fans, ""and I've heard some real crap things said over the last year.... It's time to end that. It's time to support this program."" More: Indiana basketball's Romeo Langford will 'take off' in the NBA, Archie Miller says The Hoosiers at Huber's Winery cheered in agreement. Miller wasn't heckled or jeered. Nowhere close, really. All his questions from fans were respectful and polite. Miller said the right things. He even got some laughs by acknowledging the obvious. ""Anybody who thinks that you were frustrated or the angriest person in the world about Indiana basketball, the person before you is more pissed than anybody,"" Miller told them. ""So make sure we all understand that. He gets a stern talking-to every morning in the mirror. So you don't have to worry about getting the message to him."" It is going to be this kind of offseason. If Miller's seat isn't hot, it's at least uncomfortable. After a couple of relatively underwhelming seasons in Bloomington, Miller appears to already be entering a pivotal point to his tenure. Fair or not, that's how it works at a hoops-crazy university in a hoops-crazy state where everyone expects more than a 19-16 season and the NIT.

text: We Passed Up $4,000 to Change Flights Reader Mistake Story. Today, I want to share a story from TPG reader Heidi, who was unprepared for an oversold flight: Our family of five got a great deal on a spring break trip to Athens, Greece. We checked in 23 hours prior to our Lufthansa flights, and arrived at the airport two hours before departure. As we were dropping our bags at the ticketing counter, the agent spoke the words that a part of me had been waiting to hear my whole life, yet struck a strange terror in my heart as they hung over me: ""We are oversold this evening and looking for volunteers to give up their seats."" The agent offered to book us on our same itinerary with better seats the following evening, and to provide compensation of $800 per traveler (for a total of $4,000). My mind raced; was it okay to miss one day out of an eight day trip? We didn't have any activities locked in place the first day or two, but if we delayed check-in to our hotel by a day, might they cancel our whole reservation? I looked at my husband, who said, ""Whatever you want, I'm fine either way."" Now, this column doesn't stray into marital issues, but I've fallen for that line before, and it means all the responsibility would actually rest on my shoulders. With the decision on me, I choked and declined. The mistake was so simple, yet so painful: we didn't have a plan walking in as to what our price would be. If my husband and I had simply had a conversation ahead of time (in the off chance we'd be offered a voluntary bump ), we could have negotiated confidently with the Lufthansa agent. Instead, we were caught flat-footed and missed a great opportunity to recoup more than half the cost of our trip. Typing this less than 24 hours since it happened, I still have a knot in my stomach just thinking about it. As Heidi points out, the mistake here wasn't strictly turning down Lufthansa's offer but being

text: Vatican insists priests can't report sex abuse revealed in confessions. Rome -- The Vatican's highest court issued a document on Monday approved by Pope Francis strongly reiterating Catholic teaching that priests may not, under any circumstances, reveal information learned inside the confessional. The document was a response to mounting political and social pressure for priests to report details of sexual abuse of minors acquired during confessions to authorities. The document states that any legislation aimed at forcing priests to report such information would be an ""unacceptable offense"" against the church's freedom from secular power, as well as a violation of the religious freedoms of both the penitent and the confessor. The Vatican said it felt it was ""necessary to intervene,"" to explain the importance of the confessional seal to the church, and to promote understanding of it. The statement came as a bill makes its way through the California legislature that would require clergy members to report confessions of sexual abuse. The legislation could force California priests to choose between breaking the law and violating the seal of the confessional. Seven other U.S. states have such laws on their books, as does Ireland and two of Australia's eight states. Similar laws are being debated in Chile. Church spends $10.6M lobbying against sex abuse legislation It is unclear if any priest has ever been in a situation to comply with these laws in those places -- or if any have been prosecuted as a result of non-compliance. The six-page document was issued on Monday by the Vatican's Apostolic Penitentiary, which deals with issues of confessions, also known in the Catholic Church as the sacrament of penitence or reconciliation. It was signed by the court's Major Penitentiary, Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, who said that while the concept is not always understood in modern society, the seal of the confessional is inviolable, indispensable and necessary for the priest's (referred to as the confessor) freedom of conscience. ""The sacramental seal is indispensable, and no human power has jurisdiction, nor can it claim it,""

text: How Jim Harbaugh's Michigan is now joining the spread offense world. One of the most manball-prone coaches in the country has joined the RPO revolution. At Stanford, Jim Harbaugh appeared to be the reckoning for the spread offense. His Cardinal offenses promised to bring back power football, with tons of bruising blockers moving around to create a symphony of violence and smash-mouth football. That was what Harbaugh offered to Michigan when he arrived for 2015: to bring back Bo Schembechler-style neanderball and get back to running over opponents. 2018 was Year 4 of the Harbaugh era. In a season-defining showdown with Ohio State, the Wolverines ran 37 times for a solid 177 yards (4.8 per carry) and two TDs. It didn't stop them from losing 62-39 and seeing their Playoff hopes go up in smoke. Harbaugh's last offense at Stanford, 2010's, finished No. 3 in S&P+. His Wolverines have struggled to put together an offensive line like that one, which yielded six sacks on Andrew Luck all season and produced multiple draft picks. They've also cycled through a different starting QB for all four seasons, and they haven't finished better than 25th in S&P+. But in 2018, Harbaugh started Michigan down a path that will transform the team in 2019 and beyond. The Wolverines are going to the RPO spread. Harbaugh made a few substantial changes. They started with hiring run-game guru Ed Warriner as line coach and bringing in Ole Miss transfer QB Shea Pattesron. Warriner brought a rich background with spread coaches over the last two decades, from Mark Mangino to Urban Meyer to P.J. Fleck. Harbaugh snatched him up to convert Michigan's power run playbook into a simpler system built around inside zone. They did exactly that, bumping Shea back into shotgun and pistol alignments so they could run zone-read plays, often from

text: State police identify victims in East Hartford I-84 crash. EAST HARTFORD -- State police said a Pennsylvania man and a South Windsor woman were killed in Monday's fiery crash in East Hartford. Police said two tractor-trailers and a school bus were stopped on I-84 west in East Hartford in the center lane. According to police, another tractor-trailer driven by 52-year-old Norman Bliss, of Etters, Pennsylvania, was driving on I-84 west, about to collide with the back of the school bus. The bus was driven by 67-year-old Verlean Douglas, of South Windsor. Police said that Bliss tried to take evasive actions, and tried to brake and steer to the left, partially entering the left lane of the highway. Bliss was unable to stop in time. The front of Bliss' truck collided into the back of the bus, which pushed the bus into the tractor-trailer in front of them, causing a chain reaction. Bliss's truck jack-knifed and then caught fire. The fire then spread to the bus and the other two tractor trailers. Bliss and Douglas were both killed in the crash. The other occupants of the trucks were uninjured, according to police. State police said the cause of the collision is still under investigation. 2019 WTIC-TV, Hartford Visit WTIC-TV, Hartford at www.fox61.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

text: The ultimate luxury guide to Big Sur. California's coastline is my favorite place in all of America. I haven't been to all 50 states, but I recently drove 3,500 miles across a (relatively) huge chunk of it and nowhere was my jaw on my lap more than during the soaring stretches of the Pacific Coast Highway. This 600-mile track of tarmac between San Diego and San Francisco gets especially impressive on the 90 miles from San Simeon to Carmel-by-the-Sea famous former mayor alert: Clint Eastwood once held the post in this quaint maritime village where the road dramatically dips and curves along the coast with the Pacific to the west and the Santa Lucia mountains to the east. This isolated frontier is still on the wild side, with a population of just 5,000, some more notable than others (Henry Miller, and Jack Kerouac and his Beat Generation crew were fans). Heavy storms and landslides in the spring of 2017 caused the destruction of the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge, but the roads have since reopened and Big Sur is back in business. The beauty is so breathtaking that Native Americans believe the land to be sacred and Henry Miller was so mesmerised, he said it is ""the face of the Earth as the creator intended it to look"". Just keep your fingers crossed there's no fog... Where to stay Post Ranch Inn has been Big Sur's ultimate accommodation since 1992, with 40 ocean-edge treehouses looming 1,200 feet above sea level. If you've come for the redwoods (probably the second-most famous thing about this stretch of Pacific coastline), you won't be disappointed: the rooms are scattered in the shadows of the towering trunks, with half overlooking the ocean and the rest facing the sloping forests and Santa Lucia mountains. Each room has a fireplace and a hot tub, with wood panelled walls and ceilings, and floor-to-ceiling windows to fully appreciate the impossibly photogenic surroundings. The sea-facing suites have terraces to enjoy the endless expanse of horizon in front of you. The minibar

The worst counties to live in across America By several economic indicators, the United States is in a historic era of prosperity. The unemployment rate recently h it 3.3%, its lowe st point since the 1960s; the Dow Jones Ind ustrial Average reached an all-time high last year; and over the past decade, incomes have climbed by 14% nationwide, and by at least 16% in over a dozen states. In this context, it can be easy to overlook the parts of the country that have been left behind. In nearly every state in the nation, there is at least one county where social and economic measures reflect a poor quality of life. To identify the worst counties to live in, 24/7 Wall St. used U.S. Census Bureau data to construct an index of three measures: poverty, the percentage of adults who have at least a bachelor's degree, and average life expectancy at birth. Only counties with populations of at least 10,000 were considered. County equivalents like Census areas, parishes, and independent cities were included in our analysis. Data on life expectancy is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation an independent population health research center at the University of Washington. We also considered April 2019 unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Often, these counties have higher than typical unemployment and have reported a declining population in recent years. Many of these counties also rank as the poorest county in the state.

Nearly 32% of county residents live below the poverty line, more than double the 14.9% national poverty rate. Joblessness is one hurdle to prosperity. The county's April unemployment rate of

Amend the Soil It's been said before: a good garden starts with good soil. No matter what kind of soil you have, you can improve it and the best time to do that is before you plant. Add several inches of compost and peat moss, turning it over by the shovelful to mix it into the top 6 to 8 inches of soil. Remove rocks and roots and break up any clumps of soil you find. Compost and peat moss help clay soil drain better and sandy soil retain moisture and nutrients. Choose the Right Flowers to Plant in Your Garden Planting a water hog in a hot, sunny location is a recipe for maintenance you'll be forced to water it constantly! And, an overly aggressive plant will need to be chopped back over and over. Look around and choose plants that are suited to your conditions. Whenever possible, use native plants, which are better suited to your climate, will come up year after year and are unlikely to act like garden thugs. When you choose the right plants, you not only have less maintenance, you also have better success. You're not fighting an uphill battle. Want some flower bed ideas? Here are 12 inspiring flower bed designs. Add a Soaker Hose Unless you're planting a bed full of cacti and succulents, you'll need to water. Make it easy on yourself by hooking up a soaker hose that slowly releases moisture directly to the plant's root zone. It's efficient and really saves on maintenance. Moreover, you can easily hide the soaker hose under mulch. Here are some tips for easier weeding and watering in your low-maintenance flower bed.

They trailed the NBA Finals 3-1 and they lost superstar Kevin Durant in the second quarter after just adding the former Finals MVP back to the lineup. They trailed the Toronto Raptors by six with a little over two minutes left, but Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson showed off their championship hearts and led the Warriors back from the dead and to a 106-105 win in Game 5. Golden State showed off what has made them champions three of the last four seasons and now the team heads back to The Bay for a Game 6 that could keep their dreams of a three-peat alive.

text: The new Reagan tapes are ugly, but not surprising, to a lot of black Americans. When politicos on both sides of the aisle are bemoaning our current political climate, they often point back to previous eras when the president displayed decorum they believe was befitting of the Oval Office. President Ronald Reagan has been among those cited by those noting just how unorthodox President Trump and the current Republican Party is in worldview, demeanor and action. But new audiotapes remind us that the Reagan many Americans romanticize was a very different person in the eyes of many black Americans. An October 1971 exchange between a then-current and future Republican presidents is a reminder that an Oval Office occupant using language suggesting black people are inferior and subhuman is not new. Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today's most popular stories on The Washington Post Tim Naftali, a history professor at New York University, wrote about and posted audio of a conversation taped by President Richard Nixon where Reagan, then the governor of California, used racially offensive tropes to refer to United Nations delegates from African countries. Reagan expressed his frustration with African delegates siding against the United States in a vote to recognize the People's Republic of China. ""Last night, I tell you, to watch that thing on television as I did... To see those, those monkeys from those African countries damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!"" Reagan told Nixon. Nixon laughed, wrote Naftali, a former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. But that initial conversation furthered an anger in Nixon that helped shape his already prejudiced views toward black people, Naftali wrote: ""Nixon's anger at the U.N. delegations from African nations for the loss was misplaced. His own State Department blamed factors other than African voting, including maneuvering by the British and French behind the scenes, for the loss. But Nixon would have none of it. The Africans were to blame."" Previous tapes had already revealed the extent of Nixon's racist views, but the tape represented a more blatant example

text: Warriors plan to offer Klay Thompson five-year max deal. The Warriors are planning to offer All-Star guard Klay Thompson a five-year, maximum-salary contract when free agency opens on Sunday, reports ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. According to Wojnarowski, that offer will likely accelerate Thompson's free agency, as the two sides aren't expected to take long to reach an agreement. Reports this week indicated that Thompson considered meeting with the Lakers and Clippers if the Warriors didn't put that five-year offer (worth a projected $189.66M) on the table right away. However, there has been no indication even after Thompson tore his ACL that Golden State was wavering on making that commitment. According to Wojnarowski, several teams that had Thompson on their wish lists have given up hope on that possibility in recent days, becoming convinced that the sharpshooter will remain in the Bay Area. An ESPN report this morning suggested that Thompson's camp might have been using those Los Angeles teams to create leverage to ask the Warriors for a fifth-year player option or a no-trade clause. Stephen Curry didn't get either of those perks in his own five-year, maximum-salary deal, so Golden State may be reluctant to give them to Thompson. At this point, it's not clear whether or not Klay's camp intends to push for either one. If the Warriors can lock up Thompson, they'll be halfway to keeping their core intact for the 2019-20 season. The team also reportedly plans to offer a five-year maximum-salary (worth a projected $221M+) to Kevin Durant. Both Thompson and Durant who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles are expected to miss most or all of next season but would be ready to go for 2020-21.

Ohio State football just locked in one of the best recruits in the nation for the 2020 class - a big win for first year head coach Ryan Day and wide receivers coach Brian Hartline. Julian Fleming is a 6-foot-2, 199-pound five-star recruit out of Pennsylvania, and he announced his commitment to the Buckeyes on Friday morning in a super dramatic video, in which he said, ""Ohio State is home."" He's the No. 1 wide receiver nationally in the 2020 class and is ranked No. 6 overall by 247Sports, while ESPN has him at No. 4 overall. Ohio State was just one of several on a long list of schools to make Fleming an offer. He also received offers from Clemson, Alabama, Georgia, Penn State - four other programs he was also reportedly seriously considering - Notre Dame, Florida and Texas A&M.

Three elderly people were found dead on Tuesday in Dungog, north of Sydney, where homes have been washed away by flooding. Some 200,000 homes across the state are still without power on Wednesday. Australia's weather agency has warned of more heavy rain and high winds before conditions begin to ease. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has said that gusts of 100km/h (62mph) are still possible along the coast and that thunderstorms could lead to flash flooding for parts of the Sydney area and Illawarra district.

What: Shares of Cablevision Systems Corporation were up 15% Wednesday after Charter Communications reaffirmed its decision to acquire Bright House Networks for $10.4 billion, fueling speculation of further consolidation in the space. So what: To be sure, earlier this month at a cable convention, Cablevision CEO Jim Dolan noted he would be open to making a similar deal to be acquired by Time Warner Cable or ""any other [cable] operator."" ""Consolidation of that marketplace would fuel ingenuity, provide much more access to resources for the customers, and lower prices,"" Dolan explained, ""and I think would be a great business."" Now what: It's definitely a possibility, as Cablevision's relatively small $6.5 billion market cap puts it within reach of a number of potential suitors. But at the same time, such deals are hardly guaranteed. And Cablevision shareholders should be careful not to hold a potential acquisition at the core of their investment thesis. As a result, and if I were a Cablevision shareholder, I would have no problem taking at least some of today's quick profits off the table.

text: Bengals hit panic mode early with Jonah Williams lost for season. It might only be June but the Cincinnati Bengals have somehow found a way to slap the panic button already. Tuesday, word broke from the team Jonah Williams - the first-round pick anointed as the big fix at left tackle and a positive ripple effect on the entire unit - would miss his rookie season after surgery to repair a torn labrum. And just like that, minus John Miller at right guard, the Bengals are back to the same old 2018 line that struggled mightily, encouraging the use of a top-11 pick on the unit in the first place. With Williams out, Cordy Glenn likely shifts back to left tackle. The new staff moved him to left guard, asking him to play a spot he hadn't since college. But Glenn was merely passable on the edge last year as it is and last year's starter inside, Clint Boling, has spent the spring and early summer months sidelined with a mystery ailment of his own. He's been the subject of roster speculation going into a contract year, and rightfully so. At center, Billy Price, who had an injury-riddled debut of his own, will have to take a gigantic leap next to Miller, the new arrival Buffalo wasn't too worried about letting go in the first place. Little changes at right tackle too, where Bobby Hart got rewarded for a flag-filled season with a contract extension and even the new coaching staff has refused to give him any competition for his spot. The fact the Bengals moved Glenn to guard in the first place doesn't speak highly of the depth there. That nobody is challenging Hart's spot is equalling as concerning. If the Bengals are lucky, the last few years of offensive line play can be blamed on coaching and guys like Price and Hart make leaps. Offensive scheme can take the pressure off of the line, too. But realistically, unless the team wants to make another dramatic move like it did with Glenn in the first place, Zac Taylor's debut season is now in jeopardy as

The former UCLA product originally signed with the Bears as an undrafted free agent, but was released shortly after. The former Bruin appeared in 47 games across four seasons, recording 274 total tackles and seven interceptions. He led the team in tackles during the 2018 season with 123. Pickett was among the best tacklers in the Pac-12 Conference. If he makes the Bolts' 53-man roster, he should find himself as a special teamer early on to start out his professional career. Below is the team's official news release on the signing of Pickett. The Los Angeles Chargers signed safety Adarius Pickett, the organization announced on Thursday. Pickett, a local product from UCLA, participated in rookie mini camp this past weekend. Pickett, a four-year standout in the secondary for the Bruins, registered 274 total tackles, seven interceptions, 20 passes defensed and two fumble recoveries in 50 career games. The Richmond, Calif., native capped off his Bruins career in 2018 by recording a team-high 123 tackles, including 77 solo stops, in 12 starts at safety.

The Tampa Bay Lightning will select in that slot, while the four remaining teams or whoever owns their first-round pick will fit into 28-31. Notably, the Ottawa Senators, New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings now know exactly where their newly acquired first-rounders will land. The Senators will use the Columbus Blue Jackets' selection at No. 19, the Rangers will follow with the Winnipeg Jets' pick at 20, and the Kings get the chance to add another top prospect at No. 22 where the Toronto Maple Leafs finished. Even though the Colorado Avalanche were crushed Wednesday night when they lost a Game 7 against the San Jose Sharks, there is plenty to look forward to next month. The Avalanche will get to select 4th and 16th even after getting to the second round, thanks to the way the playoffs have shaken out overall. Adding two more players of that caliber could help the Avalanche become an even more realistic contender for the Stanley Cup. The full order can be found here, thanks to CapFriendly. John Tavares was set to lead Team Canada at the IIHF World Championship that opens Friday, but now won't get the chance. The Maple Leafs' center has suffered an oblique injury and will return to Toronto for further evaluation. The Canadian roster was already lacking a bit of goal scoring punch, but will have to find a way to create some offense without the 47-goal man. The AHL Eastern Conference Final is also set, after the Charlotte Checkers finished their sweep of the Hershey Bears last night. The Checkers will take on the defending Calder Cup champion Toronto Marlies, who are undefeated so far in these playoffs. Game 1 is scheduled for May 17 in Charlotte, giving the Western teams time to finish off their respective series.

Considering 45% of baby boomers don't have anything saved for retirement, according to the Insured Retirement Institute, a lot of retirees are going to be depending on their Social Security benefits just to get by. If Social Security is going to be your primary source of income, it's important to ensure you're doing everything you can to maximize your checks. However, there are a few common ways you may be sabotaging your benefits without realizing it. 1. Not knowing your full retirement age Your full retirement age (FRA) is either age 66, 67, or somewhere in between, and claiming at this age is the only way to receive 100% of the benefits you're theoretically entitled to. Yet only 24% of those age 50 and over know what their FRA is, a survey from the Nationwide Retirement Institute and The Harris Poll found. Furthermore, the survey also noted that nearly 70% of soon-to-be retirees believe they're eligible to receive their full benefits before they really are, with the average person thinking they can claim benefits at age 63 to receive their full amount. However, if you claim before you reach your FRA, your benefits will be reduced by up to 30%. Given the fact that Social Security benefits alone may or may not cover all your expenses (the average beneficiary only receives around $1,400 per month, according to the Social Security Administration), a 30% reduction could make it even more challenging to make ends meet with just your benefits. 2. Waiting until after age 70 to claim benefits While claiming benefits before you reach your FRA will result in smaller checks, waiting until beyond your FRA to claim will give you a boost in benefits. For those with a FRA of 66 years old, for example, waiting until age 70 can provide an additional 32% on top of your full amount. Some savvy workers, then, may think the best plan of action is to hold off on claiming benefits for as long as possible. A third of baby boomers say they plan to wait until

In the lawsuit, Bouchard said she suffered severe pain and economic loss as a result of the incident. In a 16-page response, the USTA denies wrongdoing, arguing that the ""Plaintiff [Bouchard] was experienced and well-versed in the procedures and protocols of the women's tour, both in the United States and internationally, and knew or should have known the procedures and protocols as they related to the operation of the physiotherapy room adjacent to the women's locker room at the National Tennis Center and the attended rooms."" • LISANTI: Inside Wozniacki's fridge and diet on the Tour Before withdrawing from the tournament, Bouchard was slated to play Roberta Vinci in the fourth round of the women's draw. Vinci automatically advanced to the quarterfinals and ultimately made the tournament's final after a stunning upset of No. 1 Serena Williams. Bouchard, 21, is currently ranked No. 48 in the world.

text: Russell Wilson could be set up for his best season yet. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has elevated himself to elite status among quarterbacks over the past few years. The seven-year veteran is now in the prime of his career and surrounded with a plethora of talent at almost every offensive position. He is now set up to lead the Seahawks back to the postseason if he stays healthy. Wilson just had the best season of his career and got paid handsomely for it. He threw 35 touchdown passes while compiling a 110.9 passer rating, both career and franchise highs. In addition, he tied his career-low in interceptions with seven and broke the Seahawks' all-time record for regular-season quarterback wins, now possessing 75. As it stands, Seattle's offense is well-equipped to succeed in 2019 with Wilson coming off his best season yet. Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny look to be a solid one-two punch at running back for years to come, and the offensive line has done a much better job at blocking for them under coach Mike Solari than in years past with Tom Cable. Tyler Lockett has filled Doug Baldwin's shoes as the unquestioned No. 1 wide receiver following the latter's retirement and DK Metcalf possesses qualities that could make him a frequent target of Wilson, even in his rookie season. At tight end, Will Dissly showed tremendous promise as both a receiver and blocker before he suffered a season-ending injury, and Ed Dickson and Nick Vannett made solid contributions down the stretch despite their limitations. Of course, health can never be counted on in the NFL. There is no guarantee that the Seahawks will avoid crucial injuries and these players may have flaws as well as strengths, but fans have a significant reason for optimism regarding Seattle's offense in the 2019 season.

text: 35-year-old CB Johnathan Joseph still not thinking about retirement. Houston Texans cornerback Johnathan Joseph is about to enter his 14th season in the NFL at the spritely age of 35. However, the two-time Pro Bowler is yet to give retirement a second thought. After 186 appearances in the league, you would think that most players would at least consider hanging up their cleats to spend more time at home, but not Joseph. A stalwart in the Texans secondary since moving from Cincinnati in 2011, Joseph has recently been handed a pay raise by the organization as he enters yet another one-year deal. ""Honestly, this is like my third or fourth deal,"" Joseph said Wednesday. ""I get these questions a lot. So, same answer as always. I never think about it. The only thing I think about is going out there and playing this year out. At the end of the year, however my body feels, my mindset, and just talking to my family."" One of the few players to have retained their spot in the revolving door that has been the Texans secondary the last couple of years, Joseph remains a consummate professional and the best cornerback on the roster. And as far as he is concerned, he has no plans on leaving the game any time soon. ""But if I had to answer that question today, no chance, because I'm obviously enjoying being out here,"" said Joseph. ""I'm running around fine, my body feels good. So, and it hasn't even crossed my mind or even thought about it."" Given how many changes this cornerback group, in particular, has gone through the past couple of years, some sense of continuity with Joseph provides at least the illusion of stability within that part of the roster. Don't expect this to change any time soon.

text: After dropping agent, Kyrie Irving reportedly prepared to sign with Nets. Kyrie Irving's decision to part ways with his longtime agent to reportedly join forces with Roc Nation threw some for a loop. The timing was interesting with free agency set to get going in less than three weeks. It also doesn't seem to be a a coincidence that Irving opted for Roc Nation, which was founded by former Nets minority owner Jay-Z. According to a report from Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald, it most definitely was not a coincidence that Irving latched on with the agency. ""According to a source with ties to Roc Nation, the organization expected to become Irving's new representative, the All-Star point guard is prepared to sign with the Brooklyn Nets when he becomes a free agent next month,"" the report read. ""A separate league source told the Herald that his team (not the Celtics) has received the same information and is operating under the belief that Irving wants to join the Nets."" Teams still can't negotiate with pending free agents. Despite this, it has long been a foregone conclusion that Irving would leave Boston for Brooklyn. The writing has been on the proverbial wall for some time. However, this is the first time someone tied to Irving's new reps has gone on record to say as much. Things will still need to be hashed out before the start of free agency next month. But for now, it appears that Irving will be calling Brooklyn home next.

The Duluth News Tribune reports that the man, identified as a 59-year-old from Brooklyn Center, is facing three counts of indecent exposure in Otter Tail County. One of the charges stems from this week, when the man was allegedly fishing in the buff on a pontoon boat on Turtle Lake in Underwood. Someone called police Monday morning after spotting the man standing up on his boat, in full view of the caller's picture window. According to court documents, police found the man naked, and he admitted to fishing in the nude, saying he didn't think it was an issue because no one was around. The other exposure charges stem from two alleged incidents early last month, when a contractor working near Turtle Lake saw a man standing naked near the tree line.

But as the market evolves, buyers expect more capacity to go with their quickness. The rise of super crossovers like the Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus, and upcoming Ferrari SUV are all proof of that. But what if you simply refuse to settle for a crossover? We've compiled a list of ten supercars and sporty coupes that while they may not be as spacious as the aforementioned SUVs still have enough trunk room for things like suitcases, duffle bags, and most importantly, and in some cases, a set of golf clubs. Companies like Aston Martin, Ferrari, and McLaren top the list, but there are a few outliers from the U.S. and Germany.

text: Other position groups should have offseason summits, too. Von Miller's habit of organizing pass rushers for an annual effort to compare notes in order to better terrorize quarterbacks could make things awkward when opposing pass rushers use tips gleaned from the gathering to sack Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco. But as Chris Simms and I discussed the dynamic on Monday's PFT Live, an obvious idea emerged. Other position groups should do the same thing. Whether it's offensive linemen, defensive backs, receivers, quarterbacks, etc., Miller's decision to share trade secrets with other defensive linemen who make a living trying to stop offensive players from making a living opens the door for everyone else to do the same thing. It's a byproduct of NFL free agency. Before players could move with some degree of freedom between teams (in the old days, they changed teams only when their current teams wanted them to), players who played on different teams regarded others as strangers at best, enemies at worst. It's now a much different world, and if pass rushers are going to exploit relationships sparked by the fact that the players previously have played together or the vague possibility that they will play together in the future, other position groups need to follow suit.

text: Chargers projected to receive compensatory 2020 NFL draft pick. The bulk of free agency is over, and the Chargers might earn a single 2020 NFL draft pick of compensation to show for some of their losses this offseason. Tuesday marked the end of the compensatory free agent period for next year's draft. The departure of wide receiver Tyrell Williams, who signed with the Raiders in free agency, could net Los Angeles a compensatory pick, according to NFL Media's Lance Zierlein. Here's a close look at Zierlein's projection. The Chargers lost three qualifying free agents (Tyrell Williams, Jason Verrett, Darius Philon) and gained two (Tyrod Taylor and Thomas Davis), so they are expected to receive a comp pick, and it's likely to be a fourth-rounder. However, depending on Williams' playing time and performance, there appears to be a chance for the receiver to push that pick from the fourth round into the third round. While this might be hard to hear, Chargers fans, you may want to cheer for Williams to have a great season - except for when he's playing against your team. The league gives out 32 compensatory picks from the third through seventh rounds of the draft each year based on a selected pool of free agents lost. Among that, the largest 32 contracts signed by free agents based on average per-year value will net a team compensation. A formula takes salary, playing time and postseason accolades into consideration to value players and determine whether teams should be compensated for those players leaving in free agency. But the compensated-for players are also determined by a formula dictated by individual teams' gains and losses of unrestricted free agents each year. Williams' four-year deal worth $44 million ($11 million per year) with Oakland likely netted Los Angeles the fourth-round compensatory selection. But depending on his 2019 season, they could upgrade that to a third rounder if Williams performs very well in 2020. The picks won't be determined until after the 2020 season, but here's to hoping that L.A. is

text: In 2019 'draft lottery' Bills would have picked 2nd. The NBA had their yearly draft lottery on Tuesday and the New Orleans Pelicans took the headlines by landing the first-overall pick and probably Zion Williamson. Buffalo Bills fans might be more familiar with the lottery that the NHL runs because of the Sabres, which is done in similar fashion. But in honor of the NBA's lottery last night, NFL Research conducted their own ""lottery"" by creating a formula that slotted NFL teams in correlation to an NBA team in a similar draft pick they would've shared. So should the NFL conduct a lottery of their own? Bills fans wouldn't have minded. Per the findings, the Bills would have actually drafted second overall at the 2019 draft this year instead of ninth. The Jacksonville Jaguars jumped from seven to the first-overall pick as well. Here's how NFL Research lays it all out: Here's how we did it: Slot NBA lottery teams from #1 to #14 (using NFL Draft tiebreaking procedures when necessary), then match them up with the corresponding NFL team. pic.twitter.com/JvV5laoRGL - NFL Research (@NFLResearch) May 15, 2019 Buffalo is currently happy with defensive tackle Ed Oliver, who the Bills actually did draft under current NFL draft rules. But had this lottery played out, the top-two picks likely would not have changed. The Jags would have certainly taken quarterback Kyler Murray after their failed Blake Bortles experiment, assuming the fake lottery took place before free agency as the Jaguars landed Nick Foles then. Therefore at second overall, Nick Bosa could've been the newest member of the Bills, who was the No. 2 pick to the San Francisco 49ers in reality. Oh what could have been, but Bills Mafia is fine with Oliver for now. MORE: Report: Browns rookie RB L.J.

Barcelona endured a good season last time out, winning La Liga but missing out on the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. Given how the players performed last season, here's how they could be rated next time out. Marc Andre ter Stegen Position: Goalkeeper FIFA 19 Rating: 89 Predicted FIFA 20 Rating: 89 Barcelona's starting keeper Ter Stegen had another good season in goal for the La Liga giants. In the 35 appearances he made in La Liga he only conceded 32 goals and kept 16 clean sheets, helping Barca on their way to another top flight title. Neto Position: Goalkeeper FIFA 19 Rating: 84 Predicted FIFA 20 Rating: 85 Not a bad goalie to have in reserve for when/if Ter Stegen gets injured, eh? The Brazilian enjoyed a fine season with Valencia, earning a move to Camp Nou off the back of some great performances, and can expect a slight increase in rating. Samuel Umtiti Position: Centre Back FIFA 19 Rating: 87 Predicted FIFA 20 Rating: 86 Following his World Cup triumph with France, Umtiti had a disappointing season riddled with injury. Umtiti only made 13 appearances in La Liga and has been heavily linked with a move away from Barcelona, so it seems likely that his FIFA rating will decrease.

President Trump took his attacks on four Democratic lawmakers to a raucous campaign rally in North Carolina where his supporters chanted ""send her back,"" echoing the president's racist tweet that the four women of color should ""go back"" to the countries they came from. The rally, in a state President Trump narrowly won in 2016, was a chance to test how his controversial approach is resonating with supporters. They were with him all the way. ""I like it because it seems to work,"" Michael Huff said before attending the rally. ""You see all these people out here, I mean, he's got a lot of following."" ""Everything is so freakin' touchy with all of them. They have no sense of humor. They have no common sense. I'm sorry. Just a bag of idiots,"" said another supporter of the president.

text: Report: At least five teams showing interest in signing Marcus Morris. Per The Athletic's Shams Charania, Boston Celtics forward Marcus Morris has drawn interest from at least five teams - the New York Knicks, Sacramento Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Chicago Bulls ahead of the 2019 free agency period. Charania also adds that Morris remains open to a return to the Celtics, as he eloquated after Boston was eliminated from the 2019 NBA Playoffs. Celtics free agent Marcus Morris will have strong interest as a second-tier free agent, with teams such as the Knicks, Kings, Lakers, Clippers and Bulls expected to be in pursuit, league sources said. Morris, 29, had arguably his best all-around season, averaging 13.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game and serving as a versatile scorer and defender either as a starter or reserve. League sources say Morris remains open-minded about returning to Boston, which wants to bring Morris back but has several summer priorities such as Kyrie Irving. Morris, a gritty veteran combo forward, just completed the best season of his career for the Celtics and was a stable force throughout 2018-19. Averaging 13.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game, he also shot a career-high 44.7 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from three while starting 53 games for Boston. Defensively, Morris was impressive as well, using his unique blend of size, strength and speed to take the challenge of guarding the better forwards that Boston would face. Thanks to his age, experience and fatherhood, Morris is also a mature and fiery player whose intangibles hold an important value for the team that signs him as well. Those traits may be the biggest reason why teams with a bevy of young players, like the Knicks, Kings, Lakers, Clippers and Bulls, have an interest in his services; if they don't already have a culture that rewards players with his toughness, they want to have that type of culture-changing presence in their locker room.

text: Steelers LB Ryan Shazier stays true to NFL goals: 'I still want to make the Hall of Fame'. Every day, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier wakes up with the goal of returning to the NFL. Despite suffering a horrific back injury in December 2017, Shazier remains steadfast in his goal of playing again and even more. Shazier spoke about his continued rehab and it is truly inspiring to see his positivity and focus on returning to football despite long odds against it. ""I still want to make the Hall of Fame, still want to be the best linebacker in the NFL,"" Shazier said. ""I'm not giving up on my goals, and the doctors said don't give up on my goals, so there's no problem with me doing that. I'm just going to keep working, and hopefully I'm going to be back as soon as I can."" As Steelers' Ryan Shazier pursues comeback from spinal injury, former Plantation High teammate helps guide him through rehab https://t.co/junQEKiu1Q - Plantation Football (@PHSColonelsFB) June 26, 2019 The Steelers have stuck by Shazier throughout this entire process. Last season they kept Shazier's fifth-year option and paid him more than $8.7 million and signed Shazier to a new one-year deal this offseason as well. It's hard to say if Shazier will ever play football again but when you see how far he's come, can anyone really tell him he won't?

text: One year later, Santa Fe High School principal reflects on tragedy. Rachel Blundell, the principal of Santa Fe High School, reflected on the past year since the deadly school shooting. It has been a year of emotional challenges -- yet accomplishments -- as the community continues to find strength and resilience in one another -- especially now. Blundell told KHOU 11's Mia Gradney she still thinks about that day often. ""When I walk through the doors, there's reminders of it,"" she said. ""When you see kids and you know that child is friends of one of the deceased students, it's a reminder."" Blundell is a product of Santa Fe. She graduated from the high school in 1993 and came back to join the school district first as a teacher, then a middle school principal and now the head of Santa Fe High School. She was at the school the morning of May 18 and recounted the shooting to Gradney as they walked the halls together. ""I was in the office area when the fire alarm got pulled,"" Blundell said. ""Our procedures are to go and make sure all the students are safe and out of the building. So I came out into the hallway close to the art room, and I heard the shots."" The principal shared how once she got over the shock of what was happening, she quickly went into a focused effort to get students to safety. She had to first make on-campus police aware and then mobilize students. Amid all the chaos, Blundell's thoughts eventually turned to her own daughter who was a senior at the high school. ""I couldn't remember what she had for first period,"" Blundell said. Blundell told herself her daughter was in good hands with the staff she knew so well and entrusted them to mobilize her. Her daughter is now in college and doing well, according to Blundell. ""She sought help like I did,"" she said. ""My youngest daughter now goes here."" She said they both feel safe now. ""We all pull together,"" she said. Blundell said she has never thought to leave and not show up for the kids. There have been difficult days for Principal Blundell,

text: Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee Honors KKK Grand Wizard With Proclamation. Despite public outcry, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) re-signed a proclamation Thursday declaring July 13 as Nathan Bedford Forrest Day in the state, honoring the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and former Confederate general. Each year, according to state law, the governor is supposed to sign six such proclamations for days of observation, three of which are in honor of the Confederacy, according to The Tennessean. Though they're mostly symbolic, the governor says he signs them out of a sense of duty. ""I signed the bill because the law requires that I do that and I haven't looked at changing that law,"" Lee told The Tennessean on Thursday. His decision was roundly panned by the media. New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie tweeted: ""Very cool that Tennessee has a day honoring a confederate war criminal and founder of America's oldest and deadliest terrorist group."" Forrest is known to history as a bloodthirsty slave trader and the KKK's very first grand wizard. In 1864, he led Confederate soldiers to commit what's known as the Fort Pillow Massacre, according to The Washington Post. Three hundred Union soldiers, including 200 black soldiers, were murdered there, often at point-blank range. Residents have been petitioning to remove two statues of Forrest  including a bust from the state Capitol  for years. But Lee defends Confederate monuments and the Ku Klux Klan as ""part of our history."" Earlier this year, Lee told The Tennessean that ""The Ku Klux Klan is a part of our history that we're not proud of in Tennessee, and we need to be reminded of that and make certain that we don't forget it. So I wouldn't advocate to remove that."" Everyone would be perfectly fine without Nathan Bedford Forrest Day. Everyone. Instead, @GovBillLee did this. pic.twitter.com/JbFw

text: Transfer Rumours: Spurs Closing on Sessegnon, Pogba Rubbish Returns, Arsenal Bid Rejected & More. We're in the home straight as far as the transfer window in England's top two divisions is concerned, but we still have a few days left, while the rest of the continent has plenty of time to get some deals done. What are we waiting for then? Let's jump into Monday's dose of rumoury goodness. Steve Bruce Decides Against Andy Carroll Return New Newcastle manager Steve Bruce is reported to have decided against moving to bring Andy Carroll back to the club this summer, as the former Hull City manager admits there is no urgency to get any further signings in the door. The Magpies have already added Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin to the squad to the tune of £55m, replacing the departing Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez, and the Mirror say that the return for Carroll that had been on the cards is now no longer under consideration. This seems to be supported by Bruce's comments on his new signings, as he said, via the Chronicle : ""We've got one or two things bubbling away but if the window closed tomorrow, I'm delighted with what we've done. ""We've spent a hell of a lot of money on two players, two quality players, which I think is the way forward rather than having six or eight. The way forward now, for me anyway, is quality and you can see a bit of quality in what we've brought in."" Tottenham 'Closing' on Ryan Sessegnon With Josh Onomah to Be Offered Tottenham 'closing in' on a deal for Ryan Sessegnon? As if we haven't been hearing this one all summer. But no. It's definitely close now. Definitely, say the Mail. This time it's different, because Spurs are to include academy graduate Josh Onomah in the £30m deal to bring him to north London. It does seem highly unlikely that Sessegnon will stay at

text: Chara to play Game 5 vs. Blues; Bruins go with seven defensemen. Zdeno Chara clearly is injured, but the captain is going to play through it to help the Boston Bruins in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final against the St. Louis Blues Thursday night ( 8 p.m. ET; NBC; live stream ). He reportedly suffered a broken jaw when Brayden Schenn's shot struck him in the face during Game 4 on Monday. He returned to the bench, but was forced to sit out for the third period. It seems that's the extent of the time he'll miss though. Not only is he going to dress for Game 5, but he's one of Boston's starters. Zdeno Chara is introduced to a thunderous applause. pic.twitter.com/QMOsk9IdmB #StanleyCup on NBC (@NHLonNBCSports) June 7, 2019 The fact that he's willing to soldier through it is huge for Boston, which is already dealing with the absence of defenseman Matt Grzelcyk. He hasn't played since being hit from behind by Oskar Sundqvist and while Grzelcyk was listed as a game-time decision on Thursday, he ultimately wasn't out with his teammates for the pregame warmups. The silver lining there is that he did skate Thursday morning without the non-contact jersey he had previously donned. Boston will also dress Steven Kampfer tonight, giving them seven defensemen. That might be a move to put a little less pressure on Chara and to that end, it will be interesting to see how much time each blueliner gets tonight. To make room in the lineup, former Blues captain David Backes will not play for Boston against his old team. Backes has averaged just 9:44 minutes per game in the 2019 playoffs and was on the ice for 9:09 minutes in Game 4. Ryan Dadoun is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports. Drop him a line at

Event promoter Stephane Ratel has said he wants to grow the concept formulated together with the FIA from the three-circuit categories on the bill of this year's inaugural Games at Vallelunga in November to a minimum of six classes of racing. Read Also: Cars revealed for Olympics-style Motorsport Games But he revealed to Motorsport.com that plans to have as ""much as possible"" on the bill in 2020 when the competition for national teams is expected to move to Paul Ricard. The Games will kick off with the second-running of the GT Cup of Nations (a pro-am event for GT3 cars), TCR tin-tops and Formula 4 on November 1-3. Ratel has talked about a prototype category, Formula 3, rallying and historic racing as potential additions for next season. ""We have announced the idea for year one and then we want to talk to more championship organisers about joining us for year two,"" he told Motorsport.com. ""This event can't be achieved by the Stephane Ratel Organisation doing all the categories; we need to work with existing promoters. ""That is why we are working with Marcello Lotti [the founder of TCR] for this year."" He added that he would be ""very happy"" if the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, the promoter the World Endurance Championship and organiser of the European Le Mans Series, brought a grid of prototypes to the Games in the future. Ratel explained that he favoured a move to Ricard because it would allow for different events to taking place concurrently. ""We could have one race taking place on the 3.8km circuit and another on the 1.7km circuit, and Ricard also has its own rally stage and a kart track,"" he said. ""I don't want a long event, but something that is super-compact with lots of things happening at the same time.""

text: Tyrann Mathieu sees ""great challenge"" ahead for Chiefs defense. The Chiefs won the AFC West and advanced to the AFC title game last year thanks in large part to the most prolific offense in the league, but their defense didn't hit the same highs and the team used January's overtime loss to the Patriots as a precursor for big changes to the unit. Steve Spagnuolo is now the coordinator and they brought in players like safety Tyrann Mathieu, defensive end Frank Clark, cornerback Bashaud Breeland, defensive end Alex Okafor, linebacker Darron Lee and defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah to help craft a new look on that side of the ball. Mathieu said during an appearance on FS1 last week that he thinks the result will be a better unit, although he acknowledged that there's a lot of work to do to make good on that prediction. ""I think we've got a great challenge ahead,"" Mathieu said, via the Kansas City Star. ""I told our group, 'This is going to be a tough hill to climb, especially where those guys were last year.' They brought myself and Frank Clark in, and I think anytime you can bring two guys in that really have a chip on their shoulders, an edge, a certain personality, you can rub off on a lot of guys in a positive way. I think that's why they brought me in, Kansas City, for one was to really kind of raise the tide of everybody around me, and so it's going to be a fun season."" Mathieu said he's not used to being a ""little brother"" to his team's offense, but that's certainly what the defense is in Kansas City these days. If the age gap is a little closer than it was last year, the fun season that Mathieu is looking for will be likelier to unfold come the fall.

According to multiple reports, the Tampa Bay Lightning have re-signed forward Danick Martel to a two-way contract for the 2019-2020 season. Martel was one of seven restricted free agents still needing contracts. With him signed, Adam Erne, Cedric Paquette, Brayden Point, Ben Thomas, Dominik Masin, and Carter Verhaeghe are the remaining names on General Manager Julien BriseBois' summer to-do list. AHL reporter Tony Androckitis first announced the signing on Twitter. Joe Smith of The Athletic then followed up the with detail that the contract is indeed a two-way deal. #tblightning have signed RFA forward Danick Martel to a one-year, two way deal. Still have Paquette and Erne, among others, to go. Joe Smith (@JoeSmithTB) July 4, 2019 As of publishing, the dollar amount was not reported yet but we will update when that number emerges. The Lightning claimed Martel off of waivers at the start of last season in a somewhat surprising move for a team with so much forward depth. The team kept him on the roster in Tampa all season likely at least in part because placing him back on waivers would have allowed the Flyers, Martel's original team, to claim him and send him directly to the AHL. Prior to last season, Martel had been primarily an AHL player and one of the leaders of the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. In the 2017-2018 season, he posted 25 goals and 40 points in 59 games. Last season, Martel played just thirteen total games. In nine NHL games, he scored two points. In a four game conditioning stint in Syracuse, he scored one point. Last year was much different for Martel in that he spent much of the season in the press box. Heading into this season, it will be interesting to see how the team plans to use him.

But Denis Pugh will be there on the range at Royal Portrush next week, most likely standing quietly nearby as the defending Open champion, Francesco Molinari, hits shots. Pugh might step forward now and then and offer a few quiet words to the man he calls ""my best work."" But there will be no preening or posturing for any watching cameras. It will be all business quiet and efficient. That has forever been the way of things for Pugh, who is perhaps the most low-profile high-profile swing coach in the world of golf today. Which is odd. A glance at Pugh's history reveals a host of well-known names and, even more significantly, a wide variety of swings and personalities that have graced the international game over the past three decades or so. As well as Molinari, Pugh has at various times guided the likes of Frank Nobilo, Colin Montgomerie, Ross Fisher, Peter O'Malley, Greg Turner, Wayne Riley, Mike Harwood and Peter Fowler to success around the globe. Surprisingly, as far as Pugh's coaching is concerned, O'Malley's is the name that is perhaps the most significant on that list. Over the course of a more than 30-year professional career, the Australian is most famous for three things: playing the last five holes on the Kings Course at Gleneagles in seven under par to win the 1992 Scottish Open; defeating Tiger Woods in the first round at the 2002 World Match Play Championship; and ball-striking that is legendary for its quality and consistency.

Video by WGN-TV Chicago The body of John Dillinger, the notorious 1930s bank robber from Central Indiana, will be exhumed from his Crown Hill Cemetery burial site in Indianapolis. Earlier this month, the Indiana State Department of Health approved a request from Dillinger's nephew, Michael C. Thompson, to disinter the body and return it to its place at Crown Hill by Sept. 16. There was no reason given for the request for exhumation. Aaron Seaman, general manager of Crown Hill, said they have not been contacted by the funeral home regarding the exhumation and a date has not been set. IndyStar has reached out to Thompson to learn more. Born in Indianapolis on June 22, 1903, John Herbert Dillinger Jr.'s family moved to Mooresville, where Dillinger committed his first recorded crime a car theft. Dillinger went from small-time crook to America's Most Wanted after a string of bank robberies and an ill-fated bank robbery left a police officer dead. His status as Public Enemy No. 1 made him a legend. RetroIndy: John Dillinger's getaway man was an Indianapolis race car driver Retro Indy: The life and crimes of John Dillinger On July 22, 1934, 15 FBI agents and members of the East Chicago Police Dept. killed John Dillinger as he left the Biograph Theatre in Chicago. Dillinger's body was brought back to Mooresville, where nearly 10,000 people waited to view his body. Funeral services were held at the home of his sister, Audrey Hancock, in Maywood. Dillinger is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. The Dillinger family had ordered two and a half tons of concrete placed on the coffin after it was reported attempts might be made by ""ghouls"" to steal his body. Not surprisingly, there have been theories that it was not John Dillinger who was killed outside the theater, but rather a double. Dillinger had dyed his hair, plucked his

text: Draymond Green propels Warriors through storm to 110-99 win vs. Blazers. PORTLAND, Ore. -- Andre Iguodala isn't feeling 100 percent. His calf is tight, but that happens this time of year. But another important ingredient of Golden State's special runs over the past few springs also happened on Saturday night: the amazing Draymond Green. Green did it again. What did he do? What he always does, in his loud and passionate way, leading the Golden State Warriors to an 18-point comeback over the Portland Trail Blazers to take a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals and send a rowdy Portland crowd into silence. Green's triple-double of 20 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists propelled the Warriors to the win, but the stats only tell a part of the story. Before we get to the game at hand, it has to be said that discussing the Warriors without Draymond Green is like discussing a paella or a jumbalaya without including a flavorful sausage. It's an ingredient that takes an experience from a good meal to something special, a nice seafood dish to something deeper. And even when the Warriors were sorry, Green's special something helped them get through the sludge. When Portland had a leg-up, with surprise starter Meyers Leonard draining 3s and the crowd roaring, Green's energy kept the Warriors afloat. A layup from Draymond at the end of the half made Portland's lead only 13, but it made for a metaphor for Green's performance. Even when the Warriors were slipping and things looked bad, Draymond clawed for everything. The result came in the end, as the Blazers now have their backs against the wall and the Warriors are one win away from their fifth straight NBA Finals. It was the type of performance that was likely heard in Milwaukee, by Giannis and company, as they (or the Toronto Raptors, just in case) attempt to join the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers as the only team to puncture this dynasty under

text: Bill Belichick On Deflategate: 'We're Focused On Seattle'. PHOENIX - With a bank of cameras focused on him, Bill Belichick sauntered to his seat as media day began Tuesday at US Airways Arena. Dressed in a blue hooded sweatshirt, jeans and flip flops, Belichick smiled as he settled behind the microphone. If he was apprehensive about managing more talk about deflated footballs, Belichick wasn't showing it. Sure enough, the first question was about the media coverage of the story. Calmly, Belichick answered. ""We're just focused on Seattle this week,"" Belichick said. 'It's all about Seattle, it's all about us getting ready to play Sunday and that's where all of our attention is. I'm not really worried about the rest of that."" He didn't seem to have too many worries as he sat through the NFL's annual performance art show. There would be more questions about the controversy and Belichick skillfully swatted them away, always saying that he was focused on Seattle. The Patriots didn't engage in discussions about football air pressure, so the questions dissipated and it became just another media day. The arena floor was packed with former NFL players, entertainment reporters, guys in costumes, folks with puppets and women in cheerleading outfits. It was, as always, Fellini meets football and there was little news value. Quarterback Tom Brady was asked early in his session about the challenge of handling the air pressure issue and he managed to provide an answer without addressing specifics. ""There's always different things to overcome and I think as an athlete you have to have mental toughness and you have to be able to compartmentalize things,"" Brady said. ""It's challenging at times because, you know, you're a human, you have emotions. But regardless of what people say, good or bad, you also understand the people that are in your corner and to have a lot of support and love, is a great

Friday night's Mega Millions jackpot has soared to $444 million, after more than two months of twice-weekly drawings with no winner. To play Mega Millions, you pick six numbers from two different pools : five numbers from 1 to 70, and one number from 1 to 25, which is the Mega Ball. It sounds simple enough, but the odds of matching all five numbers are 1 in 302,575,350, according to the New York State Lottery.

Or you might getting lucky and win a smaller prize by matching fewer numbers. Mega Millions splits its revenue between nine different prize levels, with the non-jackpot payouts ranging from $2 (the cost of a ticket) to $1 million.

Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said the team decided to fine both Callaway and Vargas for their actions. Van Wagenen said the confrontation with the reporter was ""disappointing"" and ""regrettable,"" according to DiComo. Callaway and Vargas will not be suspended by the Mets. Van Wagenen does not expect Major League Baseball to step in and issue further discipline. Callaway and Vargas both got into it with a reporter following Sunday's loss to the Chicago Cubs. After the game, a reporter told Callaway he would see him tomorrow. Callaway interpreted that as sarcasm, and said, ""Don't be a smartass, motherf-----."" Vargas then had a stare down with that reporter before saying, ""I'll knock you the f--- out, bro."" Both Van Wagenen and Callaway spoke about the incident Monday. While Van Wagenen admitted "" frustrations are high,"" Callaway declined to give his side of the story. ""It was a misunderstanding, obviously,"" Mickey Callaway said of his role in last night's clubhouse altercation. pic.twitter.com/IisUOxEJu4 Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) June 24, 2019 Callaway also said at least he wasn't as bad as Billy Martin. ""Billy Martin punched a reporter one time...I'm a passionate guy about baseball, I'm a tough competitor"" - Mickey Callaway pic.twitter.com/GOz6UFml7H SNY (@SNYtv) June 24, 2019 In a Metsian twist, that wasn't the end of the story. Callaway wound up calling reporters back into the clubhouse to address the situation later. This

text: Zinedine Zidane Reveals Why Gareth Bale Was Left on the Bench in Real Madrid's Final La Liga Game. Zinedine Zidane has revealed that Gareth Bale's day-to-day attitude resulted in the winger being left on the bench for Real Madrid's final La Liga game of the season. Real Madrid finished their 2018/19 campaign in disappointing fashion, slipping to a 2-0 defeat against Real Betis. Bale - whose future in the Spanish capital is looking decidedly bleak - was not called on by Zidane and he left down the tunnel as soon as the final whistle was blown. Speaking after the game, Zidane insisted that Bale's attitude in training meant that he didn't deserve the chance to feature. "" It is true, I did not [give Bale a chance to say goodbye],"" the Real Madrid boss said, per ESPN. ""But I have to look at the day-to-day, and make decisions. And when there is something I do not like, or does not fit for me, I must do what I think best. It might be difficult for the player. ""We cannot forget all he has done here, but I must live in the present, think of the future. We will see [if Bale continues]. I don't know what will happen, truthfully."" There has also been some confusion surrounding a specific quote from Zidane in the same press conference, where it has been reported that he claimed he still wouldn't have brought Bale on if he had a fourth substitute to play with. Zidane: ""If I had brought on another player, the same thing would have happened"" (By this I'm fairly sure he means that whoever is not subbed on would be asked about afterwards). But from that to what was reported is a massive stretch. Irresponsible. Ben Hayward (@bghayward) May 19, 2019 Spanish football journalist Ben Hayward has insisted that the quote has been misinterpreted and that Zidane instead said: ""If I had brought on another player

text: Barnhart RBI single leads Reds to 3-2 win over Rockies. CINCINNATI (AP) Tucker Barnhart is making up for lost time. The Cincinnati catcher hit a tiebreaking single in the sixth inning and the Reds beat the Colorado Rockies 3-2 on Sunday. Barnhart improved to 4 for 5 in two games since returning on Friday after missing 22 games with a right oblique strain. He drove in Josh VanMeter from second base with a grounder up the middle off Jake McGee (0-2) and celebrated by clapping his hands twice as he rounded first base. ''Getting away helped me watch the game and learn,'' Barnhart said. ''I want to keep this going. It feels really good to contribute after being away for a long time. I don't ever want to get injured, but I learned a lot by watching different hitters.'' Lucas Sims (2-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win. Amir Garrett and Michael Lorenzen each pitched an inning and Raisel Iglesias gave up a pair of two-out singles in the ninth before getting Ian Desmond to ground out for his second save in two days and 19th of the season. The Reds bullpen pitched a combined 8 1-3 scoreless innings while Cincinnati was winning the last two games of the three-game series. The Rockies went 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position on Sunday and a combined 1 for 20 in their last two games while finishing their season-high 10-game road trip with three wins. ''We've got to get the big hits,'' manager Bud Black. ''We're getting guys out there. We had a number of opportunities with two outs. We had guys in scoring position. We just couldn't get the big hit.'' Yonder Alonso hit a two-run homer, his first for Colorado after being promoted on July 23 from Triple-A Albuquerque, to make it 2-all in the fifth. ''These were hard-fought, grinding games where every pitch mattered,'' said A

text: What the Lakers can learn from the Warriors about building a roster. The Los Angeles Lakers have already put together one of the biggest pieces of their 2019 offseason puzzle by trading for Anthony Davis, pairing one of the NBA's best bigs with LeBron James. It didn't cost them scoring forward Kyle Kuzma to do so. That might be a good enough trio to compete for a conference title in the West, but according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Lakers might not be done yet in free agency. He reports the Lakers are trying to open up a slot for another max contract by offering around Mo Wagner, Jemerrio Jones and Isaac Bonga - the only other three players under contract for next season. That could lead to the team then signing one of the big names on the market. Video by FOX Sports That would create quite a superteam... but how would the Lakers then fill out a bench? Here's an answer: Lakers are aggressively pursuing the purchase of second-round picks in Thursday's NBA Draft too, league sources tell ESPN. Those picks will offer two important things for LA: acquisition of inexpensive labor and ability to exceed the salary cap with those minimum contracts. https://t.co/19s9qn8Lbm - Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) June 19, 2019 This seems like a really bad idea, especially in the wake of what happened to the Golden State Warriors just weeks ago. Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney all missed playoff games due to injury and fell short because they just didn't have the depth to make up for those losses. The Toronto Raptors, on the other hand, had a balanced lineup and a deep bench that included Serge Ibaka and Fred VanVleet that helped them win a title. Couple that with the fact that Davis has a history of injuries - he's played over 70 games just twice seven years - and that LeBron James will be entering his 16th season and it's worrisome that the La

The fastest-shrinking place in each state U.S. population growth slowed to jus t 0.6% in 201 8 -- the lowest growth rate in 80 years. The last time the annual population growth was this low, the nation was in the thro es of the Great De pression, when job opportunities were limited and there was little optimism about the future. While the national population growth just hit a historic low, there are towns and cities across the country where even a small 0.6% population bump would be a welcome change. In these places, population decline has been a defining demographic trend for years. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed population changes between 2010 and 2017 in nearly 15,000 cities, towns, villages, and Census designated places to identify the fastest shrinking place in every state. We only considered areas with populations of at least 1,000. To ensure accuracy, we did not consider places where the margin of error for population was greater than 10%. All data are five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. National population growth is slowing primarily because the country's population is aging. This also appears to be a factor in many of the cities and towns on this list. In the fastest shrinking town in 38 states, the median age exceeds the national median of 37.8 years. Similarly, in the vast majority of places on this list, the share of residents 65 and older is greater than the comparable share statewide. While these places tend to have large shares of retirement-age residents, they are not necessarily the places with the oldest populations in their state. These are the oldest counties in every state. Just like during the Great Depression, when population growth slowed nationwide, in many of these areas, economic conditions are lagging. In the majority of cities and towns on this list, the median household income is lower than it is across their respective state as a whole. This is in stark contrast to the fastest growing place in every state -- which tend to be relatively affluent areas. Click

text: Brewers pull away from Cubs, win 7th in row. CHICAGO The Milwaukee Brewers' pitching resurgence continued Friday afternoon at Wrigley Field. Six pitchers combined on a seven-hit shutout as the Brewers pulled away to a 7-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs. It was the seventh win in a row for the Brewers, who have allowed a total of 12 runs over that stretch. BOX SCORE: BREWERS 7, CUBS 0 Both teams entered the series with a head of steam, so something had to give. The Cubs had won 10 of 11 to move into first place in the NL Central. The Brewers were coming off an 8-2 home stand and had won 10 of 13. The Cubs' starting pitcher in that Game No. 163 was left-hander José Quintana, who seems to pitch a dozen times against the Brewers every season. And, sure enough, Quintana was on the mound again to face the Brewers, who enjoyed a rare thumping (eight runs in three innings) of him, 13-10, at Miller Park on April 5. Quintana was back to old tricks in this one, facing the minimum number of hitters through three innings. He continued to cruise by striking out Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich in the fourth before an old nemesis, Ryan Braun stepped to the plate. Braun hammered a 1-0 fastball out to left-center for his eighth home run of the season and fourth career blast off Quintana. It stayed 1-0 until the seventh, when Yasmani Grandal led off with a single and Jess Aguilar drew a walk. Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo made a diving stab of Mike Moustakas' grounder to his right and tried to come home but was late and Grandal scored to make it 2-0. After Hernán Pérez grounded into a force at third, Orlando Arcia drew his second walk to load the bases. Ben Gamel batted

text: Prosecutors examining tens of thousands of Trump inauguration documents. Photo gallery by photo services Federal prosecutors in New York are scrutinizing tens of thousands of documents relating to Donald Trump's inauguration in a sign that the investigation into the committee's finances is advancing. The President's Inaugural Committee handed over the cache of documents over the course of several weeks in response to a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents, records, and communications concerning the inaugural's finances, vendors, and donors sent in February by the US attorney's office with the Southern District of New York. The last set of documents was produced within the last month, people familiar with the matter said. The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage. Authorities are investigating whether any of the record $107 million in donations for the inaugural was misspent, used to improperly benefit certain individuals, or came from foreign donors in violation of campaign finance laws that prohibit foreign money in US elections, people familiar with the inquiry said. The ongoing investigation is one of several into Trump's businesses or campaign-related activities the White House is facing on multiple fronts, despite the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. What prosecutors find could also shed more light on any attempts by foreign governments or businesses to influence the President as the 2020 campaign gears up. Prosecutors have interviewed at least one inaugural planner, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose firm, WIS Media, was paid $25.8 million for event production. Wolkoff, a New York City planner who has been involved in events such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala, known as the Met Gala, was also a close friend of Melania Trump. RELATED: New York Times: Former Trump inauguration official says she was 'thrown under the bus' The pace and direction of the investigation is unclear. So far prosecutors have not interviewed some of the top finance organizers of the inaugural or asked the Trump Organization for documents, according to people familiar with the investigation.

text: Bleacher Report lists D.J. Hayden's contract as the Jags' most team friendly. When former cornerback Aaron Colvin elected to part ways with the Jacksonville Jaguars and sign with the Houston Texans, many fans expressed their frustrations with the front office. Most of those same fans also didn't like the contract the Jags gave D.J. Hayden to replace him not too soon after as his three-year $19 million deal guaranteeing $9.45 million was simply viewed as too much for a nickel corner. However, the young corner balled out and was a playmaker for the Jags' defense. Now, a year later, Bleacher Report's Christopher Knox seems to believe the deal was actually a bargain as Hayden, who ranked as the No. 25 cornerback per Pro Football Focus, is set to make $15 million over the course of 2019-20. Two Years Remaining on a Three-Year, $19 Million Deal It's easy to view cornerback Jalen Ramsey as the face of the Jacksonville Jaguars defense. He's outspoken, he's brash and he's damn talented. However, fellow Jaguars cornerback D.J. Hayden has quietly become a defensive key himself. Hayden was ranked 25th overall among cornerbacks in 2018 by Pro Football Focus, three spots higher than Ramsey. While Ramsey is set to earn $21 million over the next two seasons-which is still a bargain-Hayden is due to earn roughly $15 million. Ramsey is a full-time starter, of course, while Hayden is more of a depth/rotational player-he made six starts in 2018. He's thrived in that role with the Jaguars, though, and he has proved to be one of the best values of any 2018 acquisition. While we know that Hayden isn't a better cornerback than Jalen Ramsey, Knox's comparison is definitely an interesting one. Additionally, Hayden missed six games, so heading forward the Jags will probably be getting more bang for their bargain. When looking at the Jags' outlook on defense, I could see Hay

Bennett played last season with the Philadelphia Eagles and was able to tally up 34 tackles and nine sacks. New England was excited about the edge presence that Bennett brings, along with the toughness that he's carried throughout his career. He's spent 10 seasons in the NFL and only missed seven games in the past eight seasons. He is ready for the new journey with the Patriots, but he did admit that he was surprised to join the team when speaking to media on Tuesday after day one of minicamp. ""I was caught off guard,"" he said. ""I guess I was caught off guard, but at the same time I got a chance to talk to Bill and learn the expectations. I thought it was a good opportunity to play on a team that's always competing on things. It was a great opportunity."" Bennett doesn't have many close ties on the team currently, but he did look up to some former Patriot legends. ""I used to love watching Richard Seymour, Ty Warren - just so many great players here,"" he said. ""I just liked watching them. The opportunity to get a chance to play here, follow those guys, it's just amazing. There's always been a lot of great d-linemen whether it were Vince (Wilfork). I'm just happy to be here."" Although he looked up to them, he hasn't reached out to or spoke to any those former players. ""Not recently. I just watched those guys.

Although the Miami Dolphins have not played a football game in nearly five full months, there are some walking wounded among the ranks of the team as they participate in their first organized team activities (OTAs) of the 2019 offseason. The Dolphins don't have any absences that are expected to last through the summer and impact the team's health for the regular season, but there are some lingering injuries that are now worth monitoring - we are inching closer to strapping up the pads. The good news? Wide receiver Jakeem Grant was on the field yesterday and participating in a slew of drills. Grant, who ended his season on injured reserve after injuring his Achilles tendon in the team's 10th game of 2018, was still limited but he was also looking like his old self - fast. #Dolphins WR Jakeem Grant is practicing for the second day in a row at OTAs. His season was cut short last year due to a foot injury. He looks fast as hell so fast as usual. - Safid Deen (@Safid_Deen) May 14, 2019 The bad news? Three other Dolphins who ended their years on injured reserve were held from yesterdays session - cornerback Cordrea Tankersley (knee), wide receiver Albert Wilson (hip) and linebacker Chase Allen (foot). There's no word on if or when we'll see this trio step onto the field at OTAs, but it shouldn't be considered the end of the world if they don't at all. The team has time - approximately two months - before training camp. Making sure these players are totally healthy is the top priority. Reports from South Florida also have linebacker Raekwon McMillan and TE Dwayne Allen missing yesterday's session, although those absences are considered short-term, minor issues.

The Eagles are assured of Premier League survival this season, having secured their status earlier this month. However Cardiff are still battling relegation, and a win for the south Londoners at the Cardiff City Stadium would seal their hosts' relegation to the Championship. Manager Roy Hodgson is without four players, as Mamadou Sakho, Pape Souare, James Tomkins and Jeffrey Schlupp all out injured for the remainder of the season. However there are no fresh injury concerns for Palace manager Roy Hodgson, who will be looking for a win this weekend. Here's a look at Hodgson's best available Crystal Palace lineup to face Cardiff on Saturday. Goalkeeper and Defenders Vicente Guaita (GK) - Guaita will once again start in goal, his 23rd appearance of the season. Since assuming the number one spot the Spaniard has been outstanding, keeping seven league clean sheets to go level with the likes of David de Gea. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (RB) - In 37 appearances this season, Wan-Bissaka has had a stunning breakthrough season with the Eagles. His superb campaign was acknowledged earlier this week, as he won the club's Player of the Season and the Players' Player of the Season awards. Martin Kelly (CB) - Kelly should make up one half of the centre-back partnership as usual, as he continues to start at the back. Though his 18 appearances mean he's played less than anyone else in this defence, he remains a key part of the Eagles' back line. Scott Dann (CB) - It should be Dann who is chosen to pair up with Kelly, as he plays for just the 13th time this season. The 32-year-old has also been an asset at the back for Hodgson, and will hope to help the south Londoners register their 13th clean sheet

I had braces': Jeffrey Epstein victims recall how pedophile forced them to perform sex acts ahead of his bail hearing, as prosecutors fight to keep billionaire flight risk behind bars. Two of the women who accused billionaire Jeffrey Epstein of molesting them when they were minors will be in attendance for his court appearance on Monday in Manhattan. Michelle Licata was just 16 when she claims a young woman brought her to Epstein's Palm Beach estate and she was paid to give him a massage. 'He said, god, you're just so beautiful and sexy and gorgeous and it was making me feel really uncomfortable,' said Licata in an interview with ABC News. Then he wanted me to rub his back, and he kept asking me to go lower and he was kind of talking to me. Courtney Wild was even younger, revealing that she was still in middle school when Epstein allegedly forced her into performing sex acts. 'I was 14, I had braces on,' recalled Wild. 'Like, I remember standing in his kitchen... and he also had a lot of girls there all the time.' Wild and Licata, who were among the victims in the previous criminal case brought against Epstein, 66, in Florida back in 2008, said that they will both be in court on Monday for his arraignment and bail hearing. The two also expressed their hope that the registered sex offender stays behind bars. Scroll down for video On June 30, 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state charge of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution, and ultimately served just 13 months of his 18-month sentence. That time was served not in a prison, but rather the Palm Beach Stockade, which is a local detention center. Epstein was also allowed to leave six days a week to go work out of his West Palm Beach office during his time behind bars. After his release he did have to register as a sex offender, but not in all states. That fight is over a non-prosecution agreement that Epstein signed

text: Residents gather for vigil as Dallas police announce plans, partnerships to address homicides. As a crowd gathered Friday near Bruton Road and St. Augustine Drive in Pleasant Grove, the song ""Amazing Grace"" filled the air. It's a familiar song and a spiritual that has become all too familiar at recent vigils for murder victims in the city of Dallas. ""Heavenly father we come to you, first asking for forgiveness,"" a woman prayed. Members of the crowd held balloons to release into the air in memory of the more than 40 victims who have been killed in Dallas since the month of May. Many of them were concerned residents, family members, and friends of 13-year-old Malik Tyler, the teen was shot and killed while walking home from the store this week. ""We got kids that's hurting out here,"" said Amanda Davis of OGU: Powered by Urban Specialists, a group whose mission is to stop senseless violence. ""I mean, they are losing their friends."" The group formed a prayer circle around a large group of children during the vigil. For them, the circle was a symbol of protection, since the city's seeing victims of violent crimes getting younger and younger. ""We're standing before you today to say enough is enough,"" Dallas Police Chief Reneé Hall said during a press conference. The dramatic spike in murder and violent crimes across the City of Dallas now has the Dallas Police Department partnering with Dallas Sheriff's Office, Dallas District Attorney's Office, Texas Department of Public Safety, and the U.S. Attorney's Office. They will be targeting eight of the city's highest crime areas. The chief of police will not identify the hot spots, but some residents believe areas near some of the recent deadly shootings are among those areas. 'I mean it hits home,"" Davis said. While many residents welcome the increased police presence, Amanda Davis said officers can't tackle the crime alone. ""We can't point the finger at them because they are trying to do their job,"" Davis said. ""It's the community's time to step in and help them."" At the end of the

Former Vice President Joe Biden will visit Detroit later this month ahead of the second round of Democratic debates, according to his campaign. The presidential candidate, an early front-runner in the 2020 race, will visit the Motor City July 24, according to a campaign news release. Details have not been announced. Detroit's Fox Theatre will host the second debate between more than 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls July 30 and 31. The first debates were held in Miami last week, where big names like Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren stood alongside other candidates battling to share their vision for America. Biden has long held a clear lead in the polls. But after last week's debate, political pundits are saying his standing is not so sure, according to Politico. He still maintains 33 percent in the polls, but dropped 5 points in the first post-debate survey as other candidates gained traction, Politico reported. Biden will be the 14th Democratic presidential candidate to visit Michigan this year.

text: Goldman, Morgan Stanley Do Better in Fed Stress Tests After 2018's Stumble. (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley improved on last year's poor results in the first round of the latest Federal Reserve stress tests, a sign they may have more flexibility to boost payouts to shareholders. In figures posted Friday by the Fed, the pair didn't come as close to breaching regulatory minimums as they did last year, offering hope they will escape limits on dividends and stock buybacks imposed back then. All 18 banks in the exam demonstrated an ability to withstand a hypothetical financial shock. The second and final round next week determines whether firms win approval to boost capital payouts. Results posted so far show banks are getting better at coping with what's become one of the most rigorous supervisory efforts: They maintained a collective common equity Tier 1 ratio that was double the regulatory minimum even at the depths of the theoretical recession. Lenders have been building capital for years, and while this year's exam was harsher on credit-card loans, trading losses were down from last year at four of the five biggest Wall Street firms. Still, when the process wraps up next week, analysts expect big banks to slow the expansion of payouts to shareholders after two years of surging dividends and buybacks. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allowed to dip below the required minimums in the second part of last year's test because some of the decline was a result of one-time charges related to the 2017 federal tax overhaul. After next week's round, Goldman is expected to modestly reduce its total payout in dollar terms while Morgan Stanley modestly increases it, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg before Friday's results. This year, Goldman Sachs's supplementary leverage ratio fell to as low as 4% in the first round of the Fed's test, an improvement from 3.1% last year. Morgan Stanley's ratio was 3.9%, compared with 3.3% last year. To carry out proposals to distribute capital, banks need to remain above 3% by that measure in next week's test.

Persistent rain forced the postponement of Sunday's Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race to a Monday start at Michigan International Speedway. The FireKeepers Casino 400 is now set for Monday at 5 p.m. ET, airing on FS1, MRN Radio and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. RELATED: Starting lineup | Weather updates NASCAR officials made the decision to reschedule the 200-lap, 400-mile event following an attempt to get the race started after a one-hour delay Sunday afternoon. The 36-car field completed several pace laps in hopes of reaching a 3:02 ET green flag, but another rain shower forced the cars back to pit road. Track-drying resumed, but inclement weather ultimately washed out Sunday's scheduled at-track activity. When the race gets started, Joey Logano will lead the field to the green flag in his No. 22 Team Penske Ford after securing the Busch Pole Award in Saturday qualifying. Aric Almirola, in the No. 10 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, will join Logano on the front row for the season's 15th race in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.

text: Rudy Giuliani Cancels His Trip to Ukraine, Blaming Democrats' 'Spin'. WASHINGTON Facing withering attacks accusing him of seeking foreign assistance for President Trump's re-election campaign, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on Friday night that he had canceled a trip to Kiev in which he planned to push the incoming Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations that he hoped would benefit Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, explained that he felt as if he was being ""set up"" by Ukrainians critical of his efforts, and he blamed Democrats for trying to ""spin"" the trip. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter ""They say I was meddling in the election ridiculous but that's their spin,"" he said. Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday that he had hoped to meet in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with the nation's president-elect and urge him to pursue inquiries that could yield new information about two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One is the origin of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. The trip raised the specter of a lawyer for Mr. Trump pressing a foreign government to pursue investigations that his allies hope could help him win re-election. And it comes after Mr. Trump has spent more than half of his term facing scrutiny about whether his 2016 campaign conspired with Ukraine's hostile neighbor, Russia. Mr. Giuliani had planned to leave on Sunday. Mr. Trump has suggested he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into the material gathered by the Ukrainian prosecutors. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump intimated he was considering speaking to Mr. Barr about the overlap between Mr. Biden's diplomacy in Ukraine and his son's involvement with the gas company.

text: Renault: Too dangerous to switch focus to 2021 already. Renault executive director Marcin Budkowski thinks it is too ""dangerous"" for any Formula 1 team to gamble on switching focus to its 2021 car design right now, despite the advantages a head start would give. As Brawn famously showed in 2009, a major overhaul of rules can be a good opportunity for a team to steal the march on the opposition by throwing its resources at the car much earlier. Ahead of a big revamp for 2021, teams are already juggling their resources in terms of future developments and there could be temptation to invest more in longer term plans because of the advantages it could bring. Read Also: Why ""damaged"" Renault is not changing its 2019 targets But Budkowski thinks the fact that the rules are unchanged for 2020 actually means that there is less to gain now by devoting effort towards 2021, because there is a danger of falling too far behind next year. Asked by Motorsport.com if there was temptation to switch focus to 2021 already, Budkowski said: ""I doubt it because 2020 at the moment looks like a year of regulation stability, so whatever you are doing today on 2019 will benefit you in 2020. ""If you stop any development on 2019 now you will hurt in 2019 and 2020. It could be a possibility next year because the impact would only be on 2020, but at the moment it is too dangerous. However, it is a balancing act. ""We are doing three car projects with the resources you normally have to do two. You have to make compromises and you have to pick your priorities carefully. ""Yes, we have an important milestone for 2021 with the changes and therefore opportunities, but we have 2019 and 2020 in the meantime that we still have ambitions for."" The balancing of resources for 2021 is also further complicated by the fact that a cost cap is coming in then, which could require a complete overhaul of team infrastructure. Budkowski says that until it is clear what will and will not be included in the cap, then it is very hard to plan ahead. ""It is difficult to comment because the cost cap has not been finalised in terms of cost and perimeter,"" he

text: New HIV Vaccine Appears Effective To Block Infection. The federal government estimates that there are more than one million people living with HIV to date in the U.S. Among these people, one in every seven may not know that they are infected. Researchers from Scripps Research Institute hope to reduce the number of people contracting the virus with a new HIV vaccine. The team said they were able to block the ""death star"" strain that has been preventing scientists from creating an effective treatment for HIV. The strain, called SIVmac239, is widely known in the scientific community for being ""indestructible."" However, the Scripps team said their HIV vaccine was able to fight death star and another hard-to-fight strain. The study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, states the approach has the potential to protect uninfected individuals from multiple forms of HIV. In addition, the vaccine showed durability during tests. A single shot provided animal subjects with long-term defense against the infection. ""We have solved two problems that have plagued HIV vaccine studies to date--namely, the absence of duration of response and the absence of breadth of response,"" study author Michael Farzan said in a statement. ""No other vaccine, antibody or biologic protects against the two viruses for which we have demonstrated robust protection."" An HIV vaccine that works provides long-term protection with a single dose would significantly help at-risk communities where medical support is unavailable. How The HIV Vaccine Works The Scripps team designed a protective protein, called eCD4-Ig, that is then carried by a harmless, lab-made virus to the body to block HIV infection. The virus uses muscle cells to travel around the body. eCD4-Ig attracts HIV and when the harmful virus approaches the protein, it will undergo conformational change prematurely. The process then cuts HIV's ability to infect the body. Researchers said that during lab tests, the vaccine did not cause serious immune reactions. The use of good virus to create treatments comes after the Food and Drug Administration's recent approval to use gene therapy tool. Farzan said their HIV vaccine promises to save lives. ""We hope

text: DARPA's developing a data network that connects squadrons even when jammed. DARPA issued a Broad Agency Announcement solicitation for a new program called Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) which aims to keep America's manned (and unmanned) combat aircraft connected even if enemy forces attempt to jam their communications. But that's not as straightforward as it sounds. US aircraft are additionally hindered by the fact that many of the platforms operate on incompatible radio networks using different encryption schemes. And while the DoD has already developed specialized data-link gateways to act as universal translators between them, the gateways' bandwidth is limited. ""DyNAMO's goal is to enable pilots in one type of aircraft with a specific suite of sensors to easily share information with different types of manned and unmanned systems and also receive sensor information from those various platforms for a comprehensive view of the battlespace."" Wayne Phoel, DARPA program manager, said in a statement. ""We aim to develop technology that dynamically adapts networks to enable instantaneous free-flow of information among all airborne systems, at the appropriate security level and in the face of active jamming by an adversary."" Darpa expects the DyNAMO technology to run some custom radio hardware it's also developing through the Communications in Contested Environments (C2E) program. This program seeks, essentially, to update the translating data-link gateways with an architecture that closely resembles commercial smart phones. That is, one where the application processing, real-time processing, and hardware are all managed and validated separately. In this way, DyNAMO will be able to take raw RF data, convert it into a format that every plane in the squadron can process and then disseminate it reliably. DARPA

There is nothing to report. I know they were pleased with the procedure.""

text: Jets reportedly offered Nikolaj Ehlers to Hurricanes. Just a few days ago there was a report that the Winnipeg Jets were now listening on offers for speedy forward Nikolaj Ehlers, and Tuesday more news came out about his potential future. Frank Seravalli of TSN writes that ""the belief is"" Ehlers has been offered to the Carolina Hurricanes in an attempt to pry free one of their right-handed defensemen. That kind of move makes sense given the Jets' recent trade of Jacob Trouba and current hole on the right side of their defense. Tyler Myers, another part of what was once a huge strength for the Jets on the right, is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent if Winnipeg can't find a way to re-sign him. The Hurricanes do have an incredible amount of talent on the blue line and have been connected to almost every team in search of defensive help. Dougie Hamilton, Justin Faulk, Brett Pesce and Trevor van Riemsdyk make up an impressive group of right-handed options that could all be of interest around the league. The team also has youngsters Haydn Fleury and Jake Bean waiting in the wings for a full-time opportunity, though both are left-handed. The Jets, meanwhile, aren't looking just to improve their defense, but also find a way to navigate what will be a difficult cap situation. Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor both need new contracts that will take up a huge part of their remaining cap space, and they still need to find a way to improve the club after this season's disappointing finish. Ehlers was a huge part of that disappointment, scoring just 37 points in 62 games in the first year of his seven-year, $42M deal. The 23-year-old forward was completely shut out in six playoff contests and now has failed to score a single postseason goal through 21 games. Mathieu Perreault, who has long been included in Jets trade rumors, was also discussed by Seravalli. The TSN

The owner of the apartment complex, Pembrooke on the Green, is under court-supervised probation for 24 months after pleading guilty to rodent related charges stemming from a rat problem that surfaced last summer. According to court documents filed last month, the owner of Pembrooke pleaded guilty to four charges including failing to keep property free of pests, failing to maintain clean dwellings, and failure to keep dumpsters free of rodents. Along with two years of supervised probation, the property was fined $3,996 and is required to follow a Rodent Management Plan. Darren Everett, President of BLDG Management, the property group responsible for Pembrooke on the Green, said the company has paid around $20,000 in health code and court fines.

Matt Stewart traces the growing line of men who say they were sexually abused by their trusted Boy Scout leaders back nearly two decades and finds himself. ""Here we are 20 years later,"" he said. ""And the story just keeps getting bigger and bigger."" More: New lawsuit: Nearly 800 accuse Boy Scouts of failing to protect them from sex abuse In 2003, Stewart and his brother Tom filed a lawsuit that broke new ground in the effort still ongoing today to unearth the scope of abuse in scouting. The case, filed against the Boy Scouts of America and the former scoutmaster they say molested them as children in the 1970s and 1980s in Tacoma, Washington, forced the Boy Scouts to turn over secret files on volunteers it had deemed ineligible. The records some of which later were released to the public by court order, becoming known as the ""Perversion Files"" revealed that the organization had removed thousands of leaders for abusing children over the course of more than five decades. The brothers' former attorney, Timothy Kosnoff, on Monday filed a new lawsuit that says hundreds of former scouts have come forward in recent months with new accounts of sexual abuse. As these new claims of abuse come to light, USA Today wanted to talk with Stewart, a man whose own story of abuse, and decision to share it publicly, laid the groundwork for those now taking the same step. Stewart, who is 54 and lives in California, continues to talk openly about the abuse he says he suffered weekly for more than a decade in the car on the way to Monday-night scout meetings, on camping trips, in the basement of his own home under the guise of working on merit badges.

text: Cubs likely to target left-handed relief upgrades. Within a broader look at the potential return of Ben Zobrist later this season, The Athletic's Patrick Mooney writes (subscription required) that the Cubs believe they can shift their trade-deadline focus to acquiring left-handed relief help now that they've addressed their biggest need by signing Craig Kimbrel. Lefty relief has indeed been an issue for the Cubs in 2019, as they've had somewhat of a revolving door to the bullpen while cycling through southpaws. Kyle Ryan has been a relatively steady presence, pitching to a 4.37 ERA (3.55 FIP) with a strong 27-to-8 K/BB ratio in 22 2/3 innings. Beyond him, the club has received sub-par results from Mike Montgomery, who has also missed time due to injury. Xavier Cedeno, signed in Spring Training, has only been healthy enough to tally a pair of innings but began a minor league rehab assignment this week. Randy Rosario hasn't fared well in a small sample of work, nor has Tim Collins. One key but yet-unknown variable in the Cubs' search will be just how much financial leeway the front office has at its disposal. Cubs ownership plainly stated it had nothing more to spend on the roster back in February; it was largely because of the money saved from placing Zobrist on the restricted list that Kimbrel even became a viable option. That said, Mooney notes that president of baseball operations Theo Epstein and his front office typically set aside a ""significant"" amount of money for in-season additions each winter. If the Cubs do have some reserve funds at the ready, then acquiring a half-season of a lefty reliever's salary could well be feasible. Even if that's not the case, it's always possible to convince a potential trade partner to include some cash in a deal.

text: The Astros Are Returning to Scary-Good Form. Welcome to the latest installment of 3 Up, 3 Down, our weekly rundown of who's streaking and who's slumping throughout Major League Baseball. Our latest edition includes notes on the Astros' blast off, Justin Turner's return to form and the Cardinals' troubling skid.  Houston's Power Surge  It's not as though the Astros crawled out of the gate in 2019 like the defending champion Red Sox, but Houston's start to the year was still a touch underwhelming. Alex Bregman and Co. kicked off the season 2 5 in their first two series, sitting at 18 14 on May 2 after losing three of four to the Twins. Houston has been on a tear since. The Astros now enter Tuesday night with eight wins in their last nine games, bruising their way past a trio of American League lightweights. Houston's 1.034 OPS as a team since May 4 is better than the current mark of all but 10 individual players (min. 40 PA) throughout 2019, and its.644 slugging trails only nine hitters. Navigating through Houston's lineup is a near-impossible task. The Astros have also mashed 30 homers in their last 10 games Bregman has seven of them. The Astros have hit 30 home runs in their last 10 games, their most in any 10-game span in franchise history. Alex Bregman has a team-high 7 of those 30 HR and 8 total HR this month, already his 2nd-most homers in any month of his career (11 HR in June 2018). pic.twitter.com/fMcs5Pw35L ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) May 14, 2019 George Springer and Michael Brantley have cruised through the season's opening quarter as AL MVP candidates, with each sporting double-digit dingers and batting averages over.320.

text: Stanley Cup Final: Blues special teams continue to be sour note. This is starting to sound like a broken record. Scratch that. It is a broken record. The lyrics go something like this: ""The St. Louis Blues need to stop letting the Boston Bruins have their way with them on the power play. They need to stop taking bad penalties to prevent the former. They need to stop shooting themselves in the foot, killing momentum gained by handing the Bruins the keys to turning the game around."" These aren't seminal lyrics in music history by any means. It's certainly no Gloria, either. But it's the sad song the Blues will be singing all summer long if they can't stop Boston's madness. Craig Berube must feel like he's talking to a wall, assuming he's spoken to his team about this crucial issue in the Stanley Cup Final. That is, of course, if he hasn't obliterated the wall with his head already. ""We know they have a dangerous power play and we've been flirting with danger all series,"" he said following the game. It happened in Game 1. In Game 2, they allowed five power plays and one goal, but it was downplayed by the fact they won the game and stopped Boston from scoring anymore. And then it steamrolled into Game 3, as the Bluenotes had none of their Game 2, penalty-killing magic left to spare. [ NBC 2019 STANLEY CUP PLAYOFF HUB ] You won't be surprised, then, that the outcome was identical on Saturday night at Enterprise Center. The Blues giveth and the Bruins tooketh handily snatching a 2-1 series lead after the Bruins went 4-for-4, on four shots, in a 7-2 win. ""They got the power-play goal that gave them momentum, for sure,"" Berube said. ""We had trouble breaking the puck out of our own end for a little bit that caused some issues."" It's not just that the goals are coming, either. That's a massive issue

text: Hannah Green claims wire-to-wire victory in KPMG Women's PGA Championship. CHASKA, Minn. - Karrie Webb has watched too many LPGA champions get doused with water on the 18 th green and made sure Hannah Green was drenched in Budweiser at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship. And you'd better believe the LPGA Hall of Famer was right in the middle of the suds-fest, celebrating like she'd just won her eighth major title. ""It's the same emotions,"" said Webb. ""You didn't do it yourself but, you know, you supported someone to realize that dream."" Webb got choked up just thinking about how this day would change Green's life. How it will reverberate throughout the Australian sports landscape, one that saw French Open champion Ashleigh Barty rise to No. 1 in tennis on the same day. Green becomes the third Australian to win an LPGA major, joining Webb (seven) and Jan Stephenson (three). SCORES : KPMG PGA Women's Championship It was after a young Webb watched her hero, Greg Norman, compete in the 1986 Queensland Open that she came home and told her parents that she wanted to play professionally. She even stayed at Norman's Florida estate as a bonus for being the over girls champion in his junior golf foundation. Webb never forgot the experience, and in 2008 brought the first winner of the Karrie Webb Scholarship to the U.S. Women's Open at Interlachen, about 16 miles down the road from Hazeltine National. In addition to the $10,000 scholarship, it was important to the seven-time major winner that Australia's best got an up-close-and-personal look at what it takes to compete at a major championship. Hannah Green was a two-time scholarship recipient, attending her first professional golf tournament at the 2015 U.S. Women's Open in Lancaster, Pa. She enjoyed it so much that in 2017, she went on her own to stay with Webb at the Women's Open at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.,

A month after completing arguably the greatest comeback in sports history by capturing his 15th major championship at the Masters, Woods arrives at the scene of one of the most impressive of his first 14 the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black. It's the PGA Championship this time but the stage will be just as grand as it was then with rabid New York golf fans set to live up to their reputation just as they hope Woods lives up to his. ""I can't even imagine,"" said Tiger's caddie, Joe LaCava, a big time New York sports fan. ""I think the atmosphere is going to be off the hook after winning the Masters."" It will be a spectacle. The PGA traditionally pairs the last three major winners the first two rounds so Woods will be going off with Brooks Koepka, whom he edged at the Masters, and Francesco Molinari, who pulled away from Tiger at last year's Open Championship. Woods will be trying to replicate what he did 17 years ago at age 26 when he became the sixth player in history to win the first two legs of the Grand Slam. He won going away that rainy week, carrying a four-shot lead into Sunday after opening with rounds of 67-68. Even after uncharacteristic three-putt bogeys on the first two holes of the fourth round, Woods did was what was necessary to protect the lead. Sergio Garcia, his playing partner, faded early, and Phil Mickelson, in the group ahead, couldn't make enough putts. Woods, despite a closing bogey for a final round 72, finished as the only player in red numbers at 3-under, three shots clear of Mickelson, then 0-for-40 in the majors. Even Garcia had to give Woods his due. ""Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance of seeing Jack Nicklaus play in his prime but I tell you one thing: it doesn't get much better than this. He

text: Japan ends search for crashed F35 fighter jet. Japan called off its search for an F-35A on Tuesday, almost two months after the stealth jet crashed into the sea sparking a scramble to recover the pilot and secrets onboard. Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters the search had been halted but that his teams were still investigating the cause of the crash, adding that F-35A operations in northern Japan had not yet resumed. The ministry would also keep monitoring a wider area with underwater cameras ""for the purpose of protecting classified military information,"" Iwaya said. Experts say Japan and the US are keen to prevent sensitive debris from the plane being recovered by Russia or China, and Iwaya himself has admitted there were ""a significant amount of secrets that need to be protected"" on the jet. Some debris have been recovered, including the jet's tail, but neither the pilot's body nor the flight data recorder have been found. The state-of-the-art fighter jet went missing on April 9 while flying 135 kilometres (85 miles) east of Misawa, northeastern Japan, on a training mission. The plane lost contact about 30 minutes after taking off from Misawa Air Base with three other aircraft. It was the first reported crash by an F35-A, according to Japan's Air Self-Defence Force. Japan is deploying F35-As, each of which costs more than 10 billion yen ($90 million), to replace its ageing F-4 fighters. They are a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to upgrade the nation's military capacity to meet changing power dynamics in East Asia, with China rapidly modernising its military.

text: Taylor, Hadwin looking to end native drought in Canada. Every time the RBC Canadian Open rolls around, the name Pat Fletcher is nearly impossible to avoid. Sixty-five years after his victory, Fletcher's win remains the last time a Canadian captured the PGA Tour's only event north of the border. It's also the only time since 1919 that the event has been won by a Canadian. There are several native sons in the field hoping to end the drought that dates back to Fletcher's 1954 title, and two in good position to do just that this week at Hamilton Golf & Country Club are Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin. Taylor's first and only Tour title came at the 2014 Sanderson Farms Championship, but he opened with a 6-under 64 that included a run of six birdies in seven holes and sits one shot off the early pace set by Keegan Bradley. ""It's been turning around all season, and it was nice to have it here this week,"" Taylor told reporters. ""To roll some putts in was a nice way to get the round started and finished off nice, too."" Hadwin earned his lone Tour victory at the 2017 Valspar Championship, and at No. 69 he entered this week as the highest-ranked Canadian in the world. Hadwin has made five straight cuts dating back to April and was bogey-free in his opener at Hamilton en route to a 65 that left him one Taylor and two off of Bradley's lead. ""I didn't sleep as well as I may have liked to last night. Just kind of thinking about the week, thinking about things, picturing walking up 18 with a lead on Sunday,"" Hadwin told reporters. ""Maybe a little too early to think about that, but it happened.... Been playing really good golf, just a matter of staying patient and keep hitting greens and make a few putts.""

text: Giants being cautious with Evan Engram, expect a training camp return. New York Giants head coach Pat Shurmur continues to be cautious with tight end Evan Engram's hamstring injury. Engram has been dealing with a hamstring issue this spring, which forced him to miss minicamp last week. Things apparently haven't changed, as Engram was once again not practicing on Tuesday. Giants head coach Pat Shurmur has made it clear that there is no serious issue and that the team is just taking the cautious approach with Engram's hammy. Pat Shurmur said he is not holding Evan Engram back. Says he is being smart with Engram's hamstring - Paul Schwartz (@NYPost_Schwartz) June 11, 2019 Shurmur and the Giants are hoping to have Engram ready for training camp. The 24-year-old has dealt with hamstring issues in the past, making it obvious why the Giants are going this route. Despite the Giants wanting to take things slow with Engram, the young tight end has stated that he is fine and there is nothing to worry about. ""I'm good. I'm just being smart,"" Engram said during Landon Collins' Charity Game. ""I don't really need anything crazy right now. I'm still just trying to be healthy for the summer and be ready for (training) camp."" When asked if it was his decision to sit out, Engram didn't mince words. ""Not my choice,"" Engram said. ""One hundred percent."" Now entering his third season, Engram stands to be a huge part of the Giants' passing attack. After lighting the world on fire in his rookie season, Engram was plagued by injury and a slow start in 2018, but finished the season strong. Over the course of his first two years in the league, Engram has missed six games, five of which came last season. The Giants are taking the smart approach here because the most important thing is having a healthy Engram for Week 1 and beyond.

""Chernobyl has been a negative part of Ukraine's brand,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""The time has come to change this."" A reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded in April 1986. It sent a radioactive plume across Europe and, according to the UN, nearly 50,000 square kilometres of land were contaminated.

text: Jordan Poole: A self-described underdog with a Warrior-like plan. An athlete will often carry a chip on his or her shoulder just as a superhero might wear a power pack for special might. For athletes, it's about gaining a competitive edge and new Warrior Jordan Poole, the No. 28 overall pick in this year's draft, is no different. Poole's chip is viewing himself as an underdog, which powers him with the mindset of having something to prove. ""I always feel like I'm in an under-dog situation and am overlooked,"" Poole told Mark Medina of The Mercury News. ""So I find a way to push myself to prove people wrong."" And he's not entirely wrong. Many sports journalists placed Poole in the second round of their mock drafts and his name did not come up in Warriors Wire's mock drafts or draft-night preview either. Now that he has turned some heads with his first-round selection, Poole has a plan for proving his worth. He cherishes the ""clean slate"" that the jump up to the NBA provides but also knows the grind is just beginning. Poole's plan to prove everyone wrong starts with a Warrior-like work ethic. ""I just keep my head down and grind,"" he said. ""That's something that got me to where I am."" But his streaky shooting and lack of commitment on defense are things the Warriors want him to improve upon. Poole's got a plan for that, too: Obviously everything is not what you want it to be right away.... A - you adjust. And B - you learn. So I'll be able to find a way to make an impact defensively, offensively, passing or shooting. Whatever it is, I'll find a way to be on the court. In four Summer League outings, Poole has averaged 17.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. He is playing 29 minutes per game and averaging 40 percent shooting from the field.

NASHUA, NH Three out-of-state residents were arrested on charges Wednesday after police received a tip about a fraud attempt at a Gate City bank. At around 11:30 a.m. yesterday, officers were told about a theft involving identification and credit cards. During the course of the investigation, according to Sgt. Robert Powers of the criminal investigation division of the Nashua Police Department, police learned that information from the initial theft was being used to attempt a fraud related theft at a local bank. ""The individuals involved were then located and arrested,"" Powers said. After detectives furthered the investigation including reportedly ""recovering identification and credit cards that had been stolen from multiple jurisdictions"" charges were filed against three people. Cathyrn Smith, 38, pictured lower left, of Vincenza Drive in Sykesville, Maryland, was arrested and charged with identity fraud and attempt theft by deception, both felonies. Stephon Samuel, 25, center, of NW 7th Place in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was charged with criminal liability to identity fraud and criminal liability to attempt theft by deception, both felonies, as well as resisting arrest or detention.

People get out of the way fast when you come up behind them in one of these. And it can haul serious ass. Powered by a twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter V6, the Navigator makes 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque to the four wheels, according to a company spec sheet. All that's mated to a 10-speed automatic. The car Lincoln loaned me is painted in a very pretty shade of Chroma Crystal Blue and the inside is dressed up in the ""Yacht Club"" theme. I am assuming that means the cool blue leather interior with white accents. A blue car, within and without. I can roll with it. This is also the Black Label version, which means that it comes standard with a whole suite of luxury options and staggering, 22-inch, 21-spoke wheels. Base price on the Navigator Black Label is $96,395, but mine has options like the special paint ($1,750). After destination and delivery is said and done, the final price comes to... $100,110.

text: Ford Bronco Test Vehicle Caught On Video Up Close In Colorado. Watch and listen as The Fast Lane Car gets a clear, extended look at the prototype in action. The crew at The Fast Lane Car hit paydirt with a YouTube video just posted to the outlet's TFLnow channel. Part of the Colorado-based team was out and about in a Subaru when they happened upon the easily identifiable odd proportions of a Ford Bronco test vehicle. Armed with high-definition cameras they did what any proper motoring journalists would do hit record and gave chase. As a result, they've given the world an outstanding look at this forthcoming machine in action. Previous Bronco Sightings: Ford Bronco Spied Revealing Front Axle From Underneath Ford Bronco Test Mule Spied Prowling The Streets Of Dearborn First things first this is obviously still a development mule wearing a Ford Ranger cab, as we've encountered on previous sightings. Mounted at the rear is the weird super-short bed and cap we've seen before, which could be actual Bronco components. This prototype is also wearing a skirt to obscure the rear suspension, and it's a very effective covering though in previous sightings we've been able to see a solid axle at the rear, so we don't believe there's anything revolutionary happening with the Bronco's underpinnings. With the TFL crew having a very strong knowledge base on trucks, they were able to apply some of that experience to this sighting. The camera was rolling as the prototype was started, and to them the engine sounded very much like the Ranger's 2.3-liter four-cylinder mill. As luck would have it, they came upon the truck again, this time stuck behind a slow-moving semi on a Colorado highway and zoomed in for an even closer look. A single exhaust outlet is clearly seen, and the taillights appear to be Ranger-spec as well. The duo even managed to get a camera along the highway for a look underneath as it

text: More confident Tre Flowers a big asset for Seahawks. Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll loves to highlight players entering their second year in the league. He often dubs their rise in performance the'second-year leap' as players tend to perform considerably better after they have a year of experience under their belt. In the case of Tre Flowers, he not only completed his first NFL season in 2018, but his first year playing cornerback as well - having switched to the position shortly after he was drafted in the fifth round of the 2018 NFL draft. ""You can imagine the first five days of practice for him last year was just a blur,"" Carroll commented on Thursday. ""He was trying to make the transition to cornerback. Now he's working on his skills, he's working on his mentality, he's working on recognition, all the kinds of things that come to play as you grow."" Flowers eventually settled into his role as Seattle's starting right cornerback, and while he had his ups and downs he proved to be aggressive and physical, while also displaying a proficiency for forcing fumbles. ""He's a monster athlete out there,"" Carroll continued. ""That comes out of his confidence, [and] he becomes more and more aggressive [and] he becomes a bigger factor. Last year he did a really good job knocking the ball out and turning the ball over for us and he's going to be one of our best guys doing that again, so he's a great asset. He's really comfortable with what he's doing right now. He seems to be playing faster. Everything is better."" Flowers is expected to start alongside Shaquill Griffin again this season, and the duo will look to build upon an up-and-down 2018 campaign and help usher in a new Legion of Boom era in 2019.

text: CBD American Shaman in York run by district judge, defense attorney. Jay Whittle's journey from criminal defense attorney in York County to the cannabis industry started about 1 1/2 years ago when a high school classmate needed legal work related to contract disputes. Whittle, who's a 1994 graduate of Valley Forge Military Academy and College, said the former classmate, Ted Daniels, was severely hurt in a firefight in Afghanistan while serving in the U.S. Army. Daniels later started a business to specifically provide armed security for the legal cannabis industry. As part of the work, Whittle went to California and Colorado. That's where he saw stores selling cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound that's derived from industrial hemp and doesn't get users high. He said he started to educate himself about the product and, later, found that it eased his anxiety so much that he's now off all medication. ""People out there use it daily for everything,"" said Whittle, 42, of Newberry Township, who handles everything from traffic tickets to homicide cases. ""I was just blown away by what I was hearing."" He later connected with District Judge Ronald Haskell Jr., who presides over District Court 19-1-04 in York. Together, they plan to open a franchise of CBD American Shaman on East Market Street near Kingston Road in Springettsbury Township, which is next to the former location of Outback Steakhouse, on June 1. ""I'm stoked,"" said Haskell, 56, of York. ""I can't wait to get going.""

text: Jason Witten unfazed by Ezekiel Elliott trip to Cabo. The Cowboys have a general sense that whenever Ezekiel Elliott returns from Cabo San Lucas, he'll be in good shape. But one veteran teammate also knows that the perception of being in Mexico can outweigh what's actually happening there. In discussing his teammate's Mexican holdout, Cowboys tight end Jason Witten was asked about his own trip to Cabo. Since the Cowboys had the best record in the league in 2007, they took advantage of their playoff bye week by getting out of town. Witten, quarterback Tony Romo (and his then-girlfriend Jessica Simpson) and a few other Cowboys ducked out for some rest and relaxation, then came home and promptly lost to the Giants in the divisional round. ""Yeah, my situation certainly, absolutely many years ago,"" Witten said, via Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ""Personally these guys don't even remember that. They're too young to know that story. Perception is reality, I guess. My lesson learned from that point. Honestly that was a different situation. It was during the playoff [bye] week."" The other difference is Elliott is working out, as he did during his 2017 suspension.. So when he returns, Witten expects the running back to be in shape and ready to work. ""I know he's going to be training, he's going to be ready to play,"" Witten said. ""I don't know if we have a guy on this football team that loves football and enjoys being one of the guys in the locker room and in these meetings [more than Zeke]. And during training camp he's a little bit of a jokester. ""He's going to work hard and he's going to be prepared and I know he's preparing himself to carry the workload like he has his entire career. I don't see that being an issue of where he's doing his training at."" At least as long as he plays

text: Jeffrey Epstein Willing To Post $100 Million Bail. Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer said his client is willing to pay up to $100 million to remain out of prison pending trial. His lawyer told a judge during a bail hearing Monday that Epstein was ""ready to sign"" for bail no matter the cost. Last week, Epstein's lawyers proposed a bail package that would let the multimillionaire await trial while under house arrest at his Manhattan home. The judge said he plans on deciding whether or not to let him go on Thursday. Epstein was arrested earlier this month and charged with sex trafficking of minors, as well as conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. Federal prosecutors, as well as two of Epstein's accusers, urged the judge to deny him bail. Prosecutors argued that due to Epstein's wealth and influence, he might try to flee the country or tamper with the investigation if he's out on bail. Last week, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned amid controversy over a plea deal he'd struck with Epstein more than a decade ago when he was serving as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.

text: Jared Goff and Brian Allen developing chemistry with 'Fortnite'. After taking snaps from John Sullivan the last two years, Jared Goff will have someone new at center in 2019. Second-year player Brian Allen is stepping in after the Rams moved on from Sullivan this offseason, transitioning from rarely-played backup to starter. Allen not only has to be a consistent and reliable blocker, but he also has to work in tandem with Goff before each snap. He has to make calls at the line, identify blitzers and set the protection of the line, which is a huge part of being a starting center. Goff likes what he's seen from both Allen and fellow second-year player Joseph Noteboom, who's replacing Rodger Saffold at left guard. ""Brian's been great. It's been fun growing with him and learning more about the way we work together and it's helped me develop even further,"" Goff said. ""And then Joe's done a good job, as well. Joe's been obviously in the red jersey so he hasn't been able to be as physical as I'm sure he'd like to be, but he's done a good job mentally and has been sharp."" Goff and Allen began developing some chemistry last year in practice, but it's gotten even stronger this offseason. Working together in OTAs and one day of minicamp was beneficial for both of them, as is playing ""Fortnite"" together online. ""We play 'Fortnite' together. Play a little 'Fortnite,' talk protections on the mics, just see what each other is thinking when we're not on the field and go through some blitz pickups over Xbox,"" Goff said. It's hard to tell if Goff was being serious about discussing blitz pickups while playing ""Fortnite,"" but just the fact that they're building a relationship off the field is great to see.

text: What Tiger Woods said Wednesday before The Northern Trust. Tiger Woods played in a modified pro-am ahead of The Northern Trust and the FedEx Cup Playoffs Wednesday at Liberty National in New Jersey before speaking with members of the media. He limited his play Wednesday due to some back stiffness, a day after he played nine holes with Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Harold Varner III. Woods has only played 12 rounds of competitive golf since his historic win at Augusta National on April 14. Woods finished T-9 at The Memorial and T-21 in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. He missed the cut in the PGA Championship and the British Open. Currently, he is 28th in the FedEx Cup standings. The Northern Trust will be just the 11th professional event for Woods during the 2018-19 season - not counting the Hero World Challenge and his ""Match"" with Phil Mickelson. Woods played in 18 events in the 2017-18 season, plus the Ryder Cup and the Hero. THE NORTHERN TRUST : Tee Times, TV | Betting Odds Woods is captain of the 2019 U.S. Presidents Cup team. The event will be held at Royal Melbourne in Australia on Dec. 12-15. There will be eight spots guaranteed and four captain's picks. Currently, Woods is 12th in the Presidents Cup points standings. Here are some of the highlights of what he had to say: On his limited play in the pro-am: ""It's best to be smart about it. Like I did pre Augusta when I chipped and putted for nine holes."" On his new normal: ""I learned a lot last year by playing too much. Coming back from my procedure and not knowing what to expect, I pushed it pretty hard. I'll never do that again. I have cut back the schedule quite a bit and that's the challenge now because I cut the schedule back but the problem was that the season changed.

Multiple Isle of Man TT winner Michael Dunlop will return to the Isle of Man's Southern 100 races in a fortnight's time, despite suffering a ""serious"" injury in a Rally Donegal crash that will mean he misses this weekend's Pikes Peak Hillclimb in the USA. A statement released by his own MD Racing team revealed he had suffered ""serious injuries"" in the accident, and has been forced to pull out of the famous Pikes Peak Hillclimb this weekend as a result. The extent of his injuries are still unknown, but a statement from Southern 100 organisers revealed Dunlop had been in contact to confirm his first appearance at the event since 2017. Dunlop will race his Tyco-run S1000RR BMW Superbike and his own MD Racing-backed Honda CBR600 in the Supersport class in his bid to add to his three solo titles at the event.

text: 3 sisters missing in Wyoming wilderness are found safe. JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) Three Midwestern sisters who were missing for days in a rugged Wyoming wilderness area were found alive in a remote area and airlifted to safety Thursday. Working on a tip from a backcountry guide, a helicopter spotted the three at about 10 a.m. in Bridger-Teton National Forest, about 15 miles southeast of the resort town of Jackson, said Lori Iverson, spokeswoman for the multiagency task force conducting the search. They were cold and hungry but otherwise OK, she said. The helicopter flew the sisters to a trailhead where their father was waiting while the search was conducted, Iverson said. Their mother was notified by telephone while on her way to Jackson. Searchers had been looking since Tuesday for Megan Margaret Andrews-Sharer, 25, of Milwaukee; Erin Andrews-Sharer, 22, and Kelsi Andrews-Sharer, 16, both of Columbus, Ohio. The three were scheduled to be back in Chicago then after leaving for a backcountry excursion June 28, Iverson said. The sisters were at the Jackson Hole Airport when their mother, Shirley Andrews-Sharer, arrived. In brief remarks, they thanked the rescuers, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. ""We just want to give a shout-out to those guys,"" Erin said. ""You really can't praise them enough for us."" The sisters had experience in the backcountry so searchers were hopeful about finding them. ""They were well-prepared for the trip,"" Iverson said. ""They had the appropriate clothing. They had the appropriate gear."" They also also stayed together. ""They stayed rational and utilized their experience,"" Iverson said. ""The problem, of course, with splitting up is if one person gets injured then that person has no assistance."" However, they did not tell anyone where they were planning to hike, leaving officials uncertain where to start searching in the vast rugged area in and around Jackson Hole. Earlier Thursday, authorities doubled the number of people combing the wilderness to more than 60, and they searched on

text: Serena's retired opponents cheering her on. NEW YORK Now watching from the sidelines, Serena Williams' retired contemporaries are as fascinated by her continuing dominance as everyone else. But unlike the rest of us, they know from experience what she does well and see clearly what she now does even better. They've moved on to other things, but they have a lot to say about Williams, who can become the first player to complete the calendar year Grand Slam since 1988 with a win in the U.S. Open final on Sept. 12. Williams plays Madison Keys in the fourth round Sunday. ""For me she's like a hero,"" says former No. 1 Dinara Safina. ""She's the best player on tour, and she proved it day by day and year by year."" Safina, 29, officially retired in 2014 after not playing for three years due to a back injury. But she's now again involved with the sport she desperately missed, working with the Russian Tennis Federation as an advisor to four Russian juniors. She is here at the U.S. Open working with them. Safina, who's nearly five years younger than Williams, says she's surprised, pleasantly so, that Williams is still playing and at this level. ""Because of the motivation,"" Safina says. ""Sometimes when you win so much and reach all your goals, you can lose the motivation."" Former player Alina Jidkova, who was 1-1 against Williams during her career, says it's incredible that Williams is still on top. Like Safina, she believes Williams has managed to prolong her career by avoiding career-ending injuries. Adds Jidkova, with a quick laugh, ""If she has no babies in the works or any marriages, why not? She's No. 1 in the world why not continue playing? I would continue if I [were] No. 1."" Jidkova, 38, retired in 2010 and went on to coach for a few years. Today she spends most of her time caring for her 20-month-old son and consults young players. Retire

text: Kyrie Irving to decline 2019-20 player option. As expected, Kyrie Irving won't exercise his player option for the 2019-20 season, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic ( via Twitter ). Opting in would have ensured that Irving was under contract with the Celtics next season for $21,329,752. Instead, he'll reach the open market as an unrestricted free agent. Irving reportedly had a June 13 deadline for picking up his player option. As Charania notes ( via Twitter ), he doesn't technically have to submit any paperwork to turn down the option, so he'll simply let that deadline pass without taking any action. Irving, 27, put up excellent numbers in Boston this past season, averaging a team-high 23.8 PPG to go along with career-highs in APG (6.9) and RPG (5.0). He shot 48.7% from the field, including 40.1% from beyond the three-point line, earning a spot on the All-NBA Second Team. However, despite his impressive individual stats, it was a tumultuous year for Irving and the Celtics, who didn't meet preseason expectations and faced frequent questions about team chemistry. After publicly vowing last fall to re-sign with the Celtics at season's end, Irving wavered on that stance over the course of the year and called out teammates in comments to the media when the club struggled. Following Boston's second-round elimination at the hands of the Bucks, the idea of Irving re-signing with the Celtics increasingly appeared to be a long shot. He has been repeatedly linked to the Knicks throughout the season, with the Nets emerging as the favorite in recent weeks. Teams monitoring the situation view Brooklyn as Irving's most likely destination, Ian Begley of SNY.tv reiterated Wednesday. Still, while the Celtics appear to be preparing for life without Kyrie, they also haven't entirely given up on the idea of re-signing him, according to a Tuesday report. It's also not clear if or how Kevin Durant's Achilles

text: Anthony Davis instructs on face-up move at Mamba Sports Academy. Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis is a modern big man, with his skill set consisting of being able to play in the post, be a playmaker and make 3-pointers at a decent clip. With Davis being new in Los Angeles, he recently did some work in the community and helped out a Lakers legend in the process. He instructed young campers on his face-up moves at Kobe Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, California. He focused on teaching them how he uses his reverse pivot to create space for jumpers in the mid post. Along with that, he also showed how they could use a forward pivot if that's more natural. Davis explained well how he looks to see where the defender is matching up with him. In the post, it's important for big men to look over their shoulders or feel where the defender is to see where they can best attack. ""Details"" with @AntDavis23 #mambamentality @kobebryant @Lakers pic.twitter.com/bE5LxUXdFK - Mamba Sports Academy (@MambaSportsHQ) July 23, 2019 Davis' face-up game is one of the best facets of his skill set. It certainly helps that he was a guard in his early days before a late growth spurt, but that's what makes him so special. With him showing youth some of his patented moves, he gave kids a close look at the intricate parts of his game. As the new season approaches, it'll be interesting to see how Davis' versatile game affects the Lakers. Last season with the New Orleans Pelicans, Davis played in 56 games and averaged 25.9 points per game, along with grabbing 12.0 rebounds a game.

text: Lack of oversight and regulations may lead to IVF mishaps. A Queens couple spent years trying to get pregnant and finally succeeded via in vitro fertilization in 2018. But when the woman gave birth to two boys in March 2019, they were stunned: The children did not share their Asian descent. The couple reported they spent over $100,000 at CHA Fertility Center in California for attempts at IVF, according to a lawsuit filed last week. Red flags began to pop up throughout the pregnancy: A sonogram showed the woman was carrying twin boys, yet the couple had not used male embryos. When they contacted the clinic about it, doctors simply told them the sonogram was incorrect. Following the birth, the couple ""was shocked to see that the babies they were told were formed using both of their genetic material did not appear to be,"" the lawsuit stated. The babies were not related to either of their parents or to each other. The couple relinquished custody of the children. How does this happen? Dov Fox, a professor of law at the University of San Diego, explained the regulatory gaps that lead to situations like these. ""Fertility centers and there are almost 500 of them in the United States today operate free of almost any regulation at all,"" Fox told NBC News. ""There's no federal law, no state law, no enforced professional guideline that enforces requirements, that licenses these facilities in the way that they label or diagnose or handle sperm, eggs and embryos, that result in the creation of people."" States oversee medical licensing, education requirements and discipline for physician misconduct, while federal regulations require the reporting of certain data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, and regulate the use of drugs, devices and donor tissues within clinics. There is also professional self-regulation among groups like the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) to develop and practice ethical guidelines and programs for laboratory accreditation. Both organizations, who share a press contact, declined to comment on this story. But there is no single government agency empowered to crack down on mistakes made by fertility clinics, and no single government entity oversees the fertility industry as a whole

text: Mike Phelan named Man United assistant manager. The worst kept secret in soccer is out. Mike Phelan has been named as Manchester United's assistant manager on a three-year deal. Phelan, 56, has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant since December when the pair were placed in caretaker charge following Jose Mourinho's firing. With Solskjaer appointed as the new head coach on a permanent basis last month following a stunning start to life as a caretaker boss, Phelan has had to wait but his place alongside Solskjaer has now been confirmed. A long-time assistant under Sir Alex Ferguson, Phelan held that role as Fergie's assistant from 2008-13 and was first team coach from 2001 before that. Since leaving United in 2013 he coached at Hull City in the PL and was a sporting director for the Central Coast Mariners in Australia's A-League. ""I am thrilled to be back as assistant manager. Manchester United has been a huge part of my life since I joined as a player in 1989 and I am delighted to be able to continue that relationship in this key role,"" Phelan said. ""Since returning in December, I have enjoyed working with Ole, Michael, Kieran, Mark and Emilio and we are all focused on preparing for the new season."" Many believe that Phelan's wealth of knowledge in training and on all things United helped Solskjaer slot into the role seamlessly during his incredible first few months in charge. Speaking about the appointment, Solskjaer added that Phelan is a ""great person to have around"" and ""brings a wealth of experience to this role with a long established connection to the club."" A daunting task of turning United into perennial title challengers awaits Phelan and Solskjaer, and if they are successful it will hinge on who Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward hires as the sporting director in the coming months. United are currently approaching multiple candidates for the position, and both Phelan and Solskjaer will work closely with them

text: The next Ezekiel Elliott misstep could be very costly. Although the Commissioner apparently gave everyone at the league office the week off, the boss showed up on Tuesday, for one apparent purpose: To scare Ezekiel Elliott. That's the only logical interpretation of Roger Goodell's decision to summon Zeke to 345 Park Avenue two days before the Fourth of July. Usually, a trip to the principal's office results at least in a brief period of detention. Elliott got only a stern talking to, stern enough to get him to rush to social media with the kind of heartfelt apology aimed at showing that he gets it, even if he doesn't. He'd better get it going forward, or he's going to get it. That's the only way to look at this. Goodell essentially has placed Elliott on double-secret probation, with one more false move resulting in a serious punishment. How serious it would be remains to be seen; the better course for Elliott would be to not test Goodell. The Commissioner easily could have suspended Elliott again. His menacing interaction of a 19-year-old security guard easily could have been pigeonholed into one or more of the various Personal Conduct Policy bullet points. (Assault, for example, can happen without battery, and assault is one of the prohibited activities under the policy.) Throw in the fact that Elliott would be regarded as a repeat offender, and a multi-game suspension would have been no surprise. The surprise continues to be the subtle shift that Goodell has undertaken from The Enforcer to something more magnanimous. Goodell seems to be more inclined to cooperate with players who have chronically violated the substance-abuse policy, and he also seems to be less inclined to punish under the Personal Conduct Policy players who haven't been arrested or charged. As noted after last year's bungling of the Kareem Hunt case, it's possible that the league overcorrected following the 2017 suspension of Elliott, which resulted from both a Keystone Cops investigation and a kangaroo

text: Scary Study: Every Extra Hour of Sitting Increases the Risk of Diabetes by 22%. Is this really the number? The connection between a sedentary lifestyle and various diseases is not new. But the huge numerical link between every extra 60 minutes people spend sitting and diabetes is somewhat of a shock. A recently released Dutch study indicates that people with type 2 diabetes spent close to half an hour more of their day on a couch or sitting at a computer than those without the illness. After the math was done, it turned out that just an extra hour is enough to increase your chance of developing the condition by 22 percent. Separate studies suggest that being inactive for more than three hours a day decreases people's life expectancy by two years. The bottom line is that the participants in the study, who has diabetes, were simply not moving as much. The research doesn't prove that sitting down for long caused the disease. Nevertheless, it raises a good question: Are you physically active enough? What is worrying about the validity of the results is that more than 2,400 middle-aged and older people participated; all wearing an accelerometer for eight days to precisely and objectively measure how much they move around at all times. This is a pretty big number. What are the chances that all of those who have diabetes 714 (29 percent) were simply lazy? Some of them had a severe form of the condition, which is what the researchers thought was the reason for the longer sedentary breaks. These peoeple's specific numbers were not included in the final results. But even then the results didn't change. ""Sedentary behavior may play a significant role in the development and prevention of type 2 diabetes, independent of high-intensity physical activity,"" according to Julianne van der Berg from Maastricht University, a co-author of the study. People with normal glucose tolerance spent on average 9.28 hours sitting; those with impaired glucose tolerance were in a sedentary position for 9.38 hours. In comparison, the people who had diabetes were sitting down for 9.71 hours. The ultimate conclusion was: ""This may suggest that sedentary behavior at least partly precede

text: U.S. pushes for Saudi progress on Khashoggi probe before anniversary of killing. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is pressing Saudi Arabia to show ""tangible progress"" toward holding to account those behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and wants them to do so before the one-year anniversary of his murder, a senior administration official said. Pushing back against critics who have accused President Donald Trump of letting the Saudis off the hook after Khashoggi's death, the official told Reuters this week the message to the kingdom is that it remains a ""very hot issue"" and ""they need to take it seriously."" Republican and Democratic lawmakers, citing evidence of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the Khashoggi case and incensed over the civilian toll from the Saudi air campaign in Yemen, have ramped up efforts to block Trump's arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Saudis needed to complete their investigation and take action ahead of the anniversary but did not specify any consequences if they failed to do so. The Trump administration has so far taken only minimal steps. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident who had become a vocal critic of the prince, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Eleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial in secretive proceedings but only a few hearings have been held since January. ""There will be increased sensitivity around the anniversary,"" the official said. ""It would be in everyone's best interest to have some tangible progress by then."" The CIA has determined with ""medium to high confidence"" that the crown prince, commonly known by his initials MbS and considered de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, ordered the killing, U.S. government sources have said. The spy agency has continued to monitor and gather information but is not conducting a full-scale inquiry, a U.S. official said. Saudi officials have denied involvement by Prince Mohammed. Trump has expressed doubts about the CIA assessment and argued that Washington must not risk its alliance with Riyadh, the corner

text: Retired Ohio State lineman Malik Barrow heading to UCF as grad transfer. Looking to strap up the cleats one more time, Malik Barrow will reportedly be heading to UCF for one final year of college football. The former Ohio State lineman, who medically retired within the last year, has reportedly been accepted into UCF and will be a grad transfer addition for the two-time defending AAC champions. The Tampa Bay Times reported news of the grad transfer on Wednesday. Barrow is a native of Tampa, so coming to play for UCF will bring him closer to home. Barrow will look to start with a clean bill of health, relatively speaking. Barrow was forced to medically retire from football last October. Barrow tore his ACL in high school and the other during his freshman season at Ohio State. Barrow was unable to play in 2018 as he continued to rehab his most recent ACL injury. However, in March, Barrow surprised some with the announcement he planned to transfer to a new school this fall, and he would be taking two to three years of eligibility with him. That will be terrific news for UCF, who will get whatever the former Buckeyes recruit has to offer. If nothing else, the addition of Barrow will certainly help with the depth chart on the defensive line and give the Knights a little extra push in the AAC. As a graduate transfer, Barrow will be eligible to play for the Knights immediatrly this fall. Follow @KevinOnCFB

He played one game more than he did last season, had roughly the same amount of injury problems, and had almost 20 more points. He was a Selke finalist again, he had near psychic links with Brad Marchand again, he was a fancystats darling always, and he became the 5th Boston Bruin ever to reach 1000 games played in the NHL. Patrice Bergeron is the Bruins best player of the modern era. As per usual. Time might even canonize him as one of their best ever if the B's play their cards right and he's still like this after age 35. It's hard to talk about Patrice Bergeron because his 2-way game is both discussed to the nth degree and also so good you really can't poke any holes in it. He's just...perfectly good at everything. He is a hockey cheat code that teams the world over would kill for. There's really not much you can say other than when he's on the ice you notice, and when he's off the ice you miss him. He makes opposing defenses make mistakes by merely entering the offensive zone. He backchecks with ruthless efficiency. He scores so easily you'd think he was putting shots on his garage door. His accuracy is near-pinpoint when he has space. He passes like he's in a video game. How on earth could you not give him a 10 outta 10 every single time he's on the ice? He's just...that good. In the Playoffs: Well...you might be able to take some points off here. Maybe like... point-6 if you're still hurting from Game 7. The playoffs were a time of feast and famine for the top line primarily because every coach worth his salt stapled their best players to Bergeron and co. as they attempted to contain one of the regular

text: United Autosports makes Oreca switch for first WEC season. United Autosports will swap from a Ligier to an Oreca chassis for its maiden full-season FIA World Endurance Championship LMP2 campaign in 2019/20. The team co-owned by McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown has revealed its intent to switch to the Oreca 07 from the Ligier JS P217 that appeared on the WEC entry list published last month. United, which is also the UK importer of Ligier chassis, made the decision after the best of its entries finished fourth in LMP2 at last month's Le Mans 24 Hours. The JS P217 shared by Paul di Resta, Filipe Albuquerque and Phil Hanson, who will drive the team's WEC entry, ended up three laps down on the winning Signatech Alpine Oreca. United managing director Richard Dean told Motorsport.com: ""I think we executed a pretty good race at Le Mans from a team and driver point of view, so it is hard to argue that we could match the best Orecas lap for lap. ""I don't think we have done a bad job with the Ligier and have won two races a season in the European Le Mans Series [in 2017 and '18]. But we were a bit outclassed at Le Mans and we are switching to the Oreca to see if the car is the reason."" Dean said that United is working to have an Oreca ready for the WEC prologue test in Barcelona on July 23/24. ""WEC testing is limited and we don't want to waste an opportunity to start learning about the car,"" he explained. ""It would be disrespectful to the opposition if we think that we can get an Oreca and unlock the potential straight away."" WEC rules only allow a team to switch chassis manufacturer once over the course of a season. Dean stressed that the team's priority since Le Mans has been to prepare its two Ligiers for the Bareclona ELMS round the weekend ahead of the WEC test.

Looking to add to his PGA Tour and major championship win totals this week at Bethpage Black, Tiger Woods was back on the course for the second round of the 101st PGA Championship. A four-time winner of the event in 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007, Woods is playing the event for the 20th time this week. The 2019 Masters and 15-time major champion shot a 2-over 72 on Thursday and a 3-over 73 Friday to walk off the course at 5-over, one shot outside the projected cut line of 4-over. Check out Woods' second round shot-by-shot below. LEADERBOARD: 101st PGA Championship Hole 18: Par 4, 407 yards OFF THE TEE: Tiger hits the fairway on his final hole to give himself a shot to get inside the cut line. That's just his third shot in the short stuff today. APPROACH SHOT: Another poor shot here from Tiger just skips on the green and then rolls to the fringe/rough. Not sure if he can putt from that grass. He's 40 feet from the hole. AROUND THE GREEN: A little bump-and-run here doesn't drop and it looks like Tiger will be heading home. He cleans up his par putt to wrap up a round to forget. TIGER ON THE DAY: 3-over 73 (5-over overall). Hole 17: Par 3, 193 yards OFF THE TEE: The projected cut has moved to 4-over and Tiger put this one on the green 38 feet from the cup... so you're saying there's a chance. ON THE GREEN: He gave this one a good look but once again a little too much pace. Had he backed off just a bit, that probably hits the edge and drops. He had 4 feet and change for par and converts. TIGER ON THE DAY: 3-over thru 17 (5-over overall). Hole 16: Par

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - A Florida man has been charged in an alleged backpack bomb plot he planned to carry out on a public beach in Key West to show his support for the Islamic State militant group, the Department of Justice said on Tuesday. Harlem Suarez, also known as Almlak Benitez, 23, of Key West, was arrested on Monday as part of an FBI sting operation and charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, the department said. According to the criminal complaint, the FBI was alerted to Facebook posts made by Suarez in April of this year in which he expressed his support for Islamic State. An FBI informant then made contact with Suarez, who told the informant that he wanted to carry out an attack in the United States. Suarez also posted a request on Facebook asking how to make a bomb, saying ""send me a video or something, and what do I need to make it."" In discussion with the informant, Suarez planned to make a bomb that would be detonated remotely by a cellphone, the complaint said. The bomb, to contain galvanized nails, would have been hidden in a backpack, prosecutors allege. Suarez was arrested when he received an inert bomb that had been prepared by FBI undercover agents. It was not immediately possible to find out whether Suarez had retained a lawyer.

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin breached $10,000 for the first time in about 15 months, recouping more than half of the parabolic increase that introduced mainstream investors to the digital asset before the bursting of the cryptocurrency bubble. ""The bounce back of Bitcoin has been fairly extraordinary,"" said George McDonaugh, chief executive and co-founder of London-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm KR1 Plc. ""Money didn't leave the asset behind, it just sat on the sidelines waiting to get back in."" The largest cryptocurrency rose by about 5% to around $10,500, according to prices compiled by Bitstamp available on the Bloomberg terminal. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $19,511 in December 2017, capping a 1,400% surge that year, only to be followed by a 74% collapse in 2018. The coin reached a near-term low of about $3,100 in December and languished around the $3,300 to $4,100 range for several months, before getting a bid at the beginning of April. It hasn't looked back from there. In contrast with last year, there are now signs of renewed mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology, most prominently Facebook Inc.'s Libra. The social-media giant is working with a broad group of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. to develop the system, which has already attracted attention and criticism from politicians raising privacy and security concerns.

LAHINCH, Ireland Jon Rahm captured the Irish Open title for the second time in three years after shooting 8-under 62 in the final round to win by two strokes on Sunday. It was the Spaniard's second victory of 2019, after winning the Zurich Classic team event on the PGA Tour with Ryan Palmer in April, and the fourth victory in two years on the European Tour. Rahm tamed the Lahinch links in western Ireland by making an eagle and eight birdies, including one from 3 feet at No. 14 after an approach with a 5-iron from rough right of the fairway. He finished on 16-under 264. Full-field scores from the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open Rafa Cabrera Bello started the day a shot behind third-round leader Robert Rock but was in front by two strokes after making three birdies in his first five holes. He was soon passed by the rampaging Rahm and fell away by bogeying four of the first six holes of the back nine. Andy Sullivan and Bernd Wiesberger both shot 66 and were tied for second place. Rock (70), Cabrera-Bello (69) and Eddie Pepperell (69) were tied for fourth, a further shot back. Rock, Wiesberger and Paul Waring all earned spots in the British Open for being the highest finishers in the top 10 among players who aren't otherwise exempt.

The British Grand Prix is just around the corner, giving fans a chance to see some of the biggest names in the sport up close. But, what do drivers do when the race is over? For some, the answer is simple - they go home and check the football scores. There are a number of drivers who are well-known football fanatics, are here are six drivers who call football their second passion. Lewis Hamilton Widely regarded as one of the finest F1 drivers of all time, Lewis Hamilton has won countless trophies in the sport, and he follows a side with a similarly rich history. Hamilton is a die-hard Arsenal supporter, and he can often be seen sporting his beloved side's colours. He admitted to Sky Sports that he has followed the Gunners since he was five years old, also revealing his admiration for legendary manager Arsene Wenger. He went to school with Ashley Young, but their friendship probably hasn't been so strong since Young headed to Manchester United. Sebastian Vettel F1 takes Sebastian Vettel all over the world, but wherever he goes, he always keeps an eye out for Eintracht Frankfurt's results. He told the Bundesliga website that he grew up close to Frankfurt's stadium, and he soon fell in love with the club. He loves watching Frankfurt play, but will always at least make sure he knows how his team have performed before he heads out on the race track. He'll need to find time to tear down his Luka Jovic shrine, but hopefully there will be a new hero at the Commerzbank-Arena soon enough. Carlos Sainz Jr Carlos Sainz Jr comes from a family who love racing, but they also have a second passion - Real Madrid. His father once ran for the Los Blancos presidency, and clearly managed to hand his love for Real over to his son, who told AS of his dream to have the Real badge feature on his helmet. He was a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo, so there's probably a little part of

text: SI ranks Bills wideouts 3rd worst in NFL. The Bills' wide receiver room hasn't had a big-named playmaker in it since Sammy Watkins departed the team in 2017 via trade. This past offseason saw Buffalo add wide Cole Beasley to the group, who's a slot expert. In addition, John Brown was added to the mix as a deep threat with the likes of Robert Foster. Zay Jones in already there, too. Combined, Sports Illustrated said that's an improvement, but barely. In the outlet's recent wide receiver rankings, the Bills landed at the third-worst group in the NFL. Here's why SI thinks so: 30. Buffalo Bills ($23 / $170 million) John Brown, Cole Beasley, Andre Roberts, Zay Jones Buffalo did what they could this offseason. It's not perfect, but Josh Allen is in a better place than he was a year ago. While not much of an explanation, the bit offered likely holds true. On the open market, there are not very often big-time talents. And if teams get them, they lock them up. Or in the case of former Steeler Antonio Brown or former Giant Odell Beckham, they're traded. The Bills sometimes splash a trade or two under general manger Brandon Beane, but the front office opted the route of free agency this offseason. Buffalo's talents at wideout could prove their worth on the field, but the upcoming 2020 NFL draft could have something to do with the way the team attacked things this past offseason. That draft class of wideouts is highly touted, could the Bills take the draft route to improve this unit in the future?

text: Bengals' Mike Brown: Bengals needed to're-excite our fanbase'. Cincinanti Bengals owner Mike Brown understands his fanbase is apathetic after several struggle-filled seasons and no playoff wins under the many years of Marvin Lewis. Brown touched on this topic in an interview captured by Kareem Elgazzar of the Cincinnati Enquirer: ""We haven't won in the playoffs and we haven't been to the playoffs for the last three years. That's an eternity in this business, that's what people remember and that's where their focus is. We have to re-excite our fanbase. We have to do some things differently."" Brown has attempted to fix this issue by moving on from Lewis and bringing aboard Sean McVay understudy Zac Taylor. The new coach, in turn, has brought on one of the NFL's biggest staffs, reinvented the vibe and set of rules surrounding the team and hopes to have a fresh set of eyes from his staff getting the absolute most out of a talented roster. Of course, Brown wasn't alone in the decision to bring on Taylor and the front office didn't seem to have much of a choice. In the eyes of many, the decision to make a change came years too late. And the propensity for it all to backfire always remains. But as Brown admits, the fanbase hasn't exactly been engaged lately. Anything was better than more of the same and if the wins start happening again, the damage done by holding onto to waning era might not be so irreparable after all.

Fernando Tatis Jr. homered twice and had four RBIs, Manuel Margot also homered and the Padres rolled into the All-Star break on a three-game winning streak after a 5-3 victory Sunday. Joey Lucchesi held the Dodgers in check into the seventh inning while Margot hit a home run for the second consecutive day as the Padres handed Los Angeles its first three-game losing streak at home this season. The Dodgers dropped their first home series since May 12-14 against the Milwaukee Brewers. ""It was an impressive series for us all the way around,"" Padres manager Andy Green said. ""We got big swings from Tatis and (Hunter) Renfroe and Margot and great pitching from our starters and bullpen. It will boost our confidence going forward. People can see that we are on the right path and going in the right direction."" BOX SCORE: PADRES 5, DODGERS 3 Max Muncy and Justin Turner homered for the Dodgers, who still closed out the first half with the most victories in the major leagues. They became the 15th team in major league history to win 60 games before the break when they defeated the Padres on Thursday, but lost the last three games of the series. As good as the Dodgers have been, they went just 6-7 over their final 13 games in the first half. ""I'm excited for our guys that are going to represent us in the All-Star Game. They'll get a little less of a break than some of us,"" Turner said. ""It's just a time to go regroup, regather and get re-energized.""

Leeds' United owner Andrea Radrizzani is reported to be against the sale of his majority stake in the club, amid speculation that the club could be subject to a big-money takeover this summer. United looked on track for promotion to the Premier League under the stewardship of Marcelo Bielsa earlier this season, but after finishing in third-place and losing their playoff semi-final with West Brom, reports began to surface that another change in ownership could be on the agenda at Elland Road. Understand that Nasser al-Kehlaifi meeting with Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani today for further talks about buying a stake in the club. Possibly some news soon. tariq panja (@tariqpanja) June 3, 2019 The claim was that the Qatari Sports Investment group, who own a controlling share in Paris Saint-Germain, were in advanced discussions with Radrizzani over purchasing a controlling interest, with a view to expanding their horizons in Europe and investing in English football. Radrizzani is reported to have met QSI chairman Nasser El-Khelaifi, with whom he has an established friendship, on Monday, to discuss the sale of the controlling share he has held since 2017, but a new report from the Yorkshire Evening Post has claimed he has no interest in selling up. Citing unnamed 'Elland Road sources' they claim that he has reiterated his desire to hold onto the club, and denied that concrete negotiations were ongoing with any interested party. That's despite the noted feeling at the club that the Italian would sell up in the event of an offer that he felt would be beneficial to the club's interests going forward, so it seems as if it may be a while before we get any concrete news surrounding the club's ownership. The club themselves have so far refused to comment, so until we hear from Leeds directly, it may be best to take reports with a pinch of salt. They have, however, triggered a clause to keep Bielsa at the

However, with Bottas pitting first to go onto another set of medium tyres, he was committed to a two-stop strategy. Hamilton extended his stint and stayed out for a few laps longer, which meant a pit stop in normal conditions would've put him back behind Bottas, albeit with fresher tyres. A safety car intervention changed the complexion of the race, and gave Hamilton a 'cheap' pit stop to keep the lead of the race. This was to be Hamilton's one-and-only pit stop of the event, whereas Bottas had to pit again for a different compound. The original aim was for both drivers to pit twice, but the extension of Hamilton's first stint enabled a one-stopper. From there, he was in prime position to control the pace and take his seventh win of the season, and the 80th of his career. Speaking after the race, Bottas admitted that he thought a one-stop strategy was out of the question, with the Finn seemingly remorseful about not being able to hedge his bets with a middle stint on the hard tyres.

The House Oversight Committee announced Wednesday that it is postponing a vote to recommend that the chamber hold White House counselor Kellyanne Conway in contempt of Congress, citing ongoing talks with the Trump administration to secure Conway's testimony. The panel was originally scheduled to vote on Thursday.

A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Oversight Committee issued a subpoena on June 26 for Conway's testimony after a government watchdog found that she violated the Hatch Act, a law that forbids federal government employees from engaging in certain campaign activities.

If so, that's a next-level inside joke for football nerds.

text: Dolphins' Norton deemed at fault for wreck that resulted in amputated arm. Kendrick Norton was at fault for the car wreck that resulted in him sustaining severe injuries and ultimately resulted in his arm getting amputated, according to the crash report obtained by ESPN. The Dolphins defensive tackle was ticketed for improper lane change, which caused the chain of events that led to the horrific crash. According to Florida Highway Patrol's report, Norton was driving his Ford F250 truck on the outside lane of State Road 836 in the Miami area when he made a quick turn to try and get to the inside lanes going southbound. As he sped up and changed lanes, he clipped the front of a Maserati, which caused Norton to crash into a concrete barrier and overturn the truck.

text: NASA's TESS exoplanet hunter found its first Earth-size planet, but you wouldn't want to visit. NASA's TESS exoplanet-hunting telescope has been on the job for less than a year, but it's already racking up some impressive discoveries. Following the announcement of a new ""Hot Saturn"" back in March, NASA just revealed that TESS found its first Earth-sized planet outside of our solar system. TESS which stands for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is designed to detect the telltale signs of exoplanets orbiting the stars it observes by spotting the tiny changes in brightness associated with a planet passing in front of them. This latest observation is actually the 10th confirmed planet TESS has discovered, but it's the first one that is likely close to Earth in overall size. Still, you definitely wouldn't want to go there. The Earth-sized planet, called HD 21749c, is estimated to be around 89% as large as Earth, and it orbits a star that is roughly 70% as massive as our Sun. However, very little about the relationship between the planet and its star is Earth-like. The discovery is described in detail in a new paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Related slideshow: Distant planets (Provided by Reuters) A year on the planet lasts less than eight Earth days, suggesting that it's incredibly close to the star. That close relationship means that HD 21749c is absolutely scorching hot, and researchers estimate that its surface is probably around 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or around 427 degrees Celsius. The planet and its star aren't particularly far away. HD 21749 is thought to be only around 53 light-years away, meaning that it may be possible to study it and its piping hot planet in even greater detail. HD 21749c isn't the kind of place where we'd ever expect to find life as we know it, so alien hunters will need to look elsewhere, but the discovery of any planet outside of our solar system is still undeniably interesting. Going forward, new exo

A full slate of Major League Soccer games came our way on Champions League final day, so if you missed any of the action while Liverpool secured the European crown. There was plenty of movement made, with the Eastern Conference getting a new leader for a short time and the West seeing a number of playoff teams go down. Atlanta United 2-0 Chicago Fire Josef Martinez is back to scoring in bunches and the defending champions was back on top of the Eastern Conference for a short time as they beat Chicago 2-0. Martinez scored his second brace in a row, giving the Venezuelan six goals in his last five games and into double digits on the full league season with 10. The clean sheet is also the second straight for the club and eighth on the year, helping to bounce back from a two-game losing streak to temporarily claim the top spot in the conference (D.C. United since jumped back on top, but Atlanta closed the gap to just one point). Frank De Boer's back line looks to be gaining traction, conceding just three goals over the last nine matches.

We took a data-driven look at the question, using Yelp to analyze which local businesses have been seeing especially high review volumes this month. To find out who made the list, we looked at Miami businesses on Yelp by category and counted how many reviews each received. Rather than compare them based on number of reviews alone, we calculated a percentage increase in reviews over the past month, and tracked businesses that consistently increased their volume of reviews to identify statistically significant outliers compared to past performance. Read on to see which spots are worth exploring, right now. Sergio's Cuban Open since 1975, this Cuban and breakfast and brunch spot, which offers sandwiches and more, is trending compared to other businesses categorized as ""Cuban"" on Yelp. Citywide, Cuban spots saw a median 4.5 percent increase in new reviews over the past month, but Sergio's Cuban saw a 22.2 percent increase, maintaining a mixed 3.5-star rating throughout. Moreover, on a month-to-month basis Sergio's Cuban's review count increased by more than 500 percent. It's not the only trending outlier in the Cuban category: Sanguich De Miami has seen a 13.8 percent increase in reviews.

text: Rumor: Lakers hired Jason Kidd to lure Giannis Antetokounmpo. New Lakers coach Frank Vogel said he wanted Jason Kidd because Kidd is a good coach. Steve Popper of Newsday : the person familiar with the Lakers process said something else: that Kidd was brought to Los Angeles to attract Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Lakers when he becomes a free agent in two years when the Bucks star could become an unrestricted free agent. Things I believe: 1. This plan probably wouldn't work. Not only does Antetokounmpo appear happy in Milwaukee, he has specifically said he could never see himself playing for Los Angeles. And though I believe Antetokounmpo respected Kidd while Kidd coached him, look at the Bucks now. They're so much better under Mike Budenholzer. You think Antetokounmpo is itching to play for Kidd again after seeing the other side? 2. The Lakers might just try this wild plan anyway. Remember when they were waiting to hire a coach in 2014 so free agent LeBron James could pick? Aside from signing LeBron last year, who seemingly had his eye on Los Angeles for years and for reasons other than basketball, the Lakers have struck out on star free agents. The franchise is getting desperate. 3. People want to believe the Lakers would do something crazy like this, and that makes the rumor spread faster whether or not it's true. The Lakers, because of their stature, tactics and general manager have made many enemies around the league. Plenty of folks are enjoying piling on.

text: No dad bod this offseason: Tom Brady shares beach workout pics. Tom Brady was the target of some unflattering jeers last offseason due to pics that surfaced online depicting the New England Patriots quarterback rocking what some referred to as a ""dad bod"" during a beach excursion. Let's just say Brady won't be subjected to any mock and ridicule this offseason thanks to a batch of beach photos he recently shared. Brady took to Twitter this week to post some photographs from a recent beach workout. Suffice to say, the 41-year-old Patriots signal-caller appears to be in peak physical condition and primed to embark upon his 20th NFL season. Form good habits, and repeat everyday. pic.twitter.com/KzQCtBrbVg Tom Brady (@TomBrady) May 28, 2019 Brady's tweet follows another one issued over the weekend in which he is shown working out with Julian Edelman and 2019 first-round pick N'Keal Harry. Edelman's daughter, Lily Rose, also was at the workout. It's a family affair. pic.twitter.com/klcWi6Wdcf Tom Brady (@TomBrady) May 25, 2019 As noted, Brady was accused of sporting a ""dad bod"" last offseason in pics where he's shown strolling on a beach alongside wife Gisele Bundchen. The case can be made that those photos did not depict Brady in the best of shape, but who's going to argue with how he played in 2018 on the way to yet another Super Bowl title? Further, Brady is known for his rigid focus on physical fitness and training, not to mention a near-maniacal commitment to an incredibly restrictive diet, both components of his TB12 program. There's no chance Brady would enter a season out of shape by any stretch. It merits noting, though, that Brady has admitted to indulging himself from time to time in the past, but it's rare.

text: Drought pushes endangered California salmon to the brink. Chinook salmon were already endangered in California's Sacramento River, but the record drought parching the western United States has brought the iconic fish even closer to extinction. Chinook, also known as king salmon, need very cold water for their eggs to develop. If everything goes right, the young salmon hatch and eventually make their way downstream toward the ocean, before later returning to the rivers to spawn and die. But the migration has dropped off in recent years. There were 4.4 million juvenile Chinook in 2009 -- half the number of four years earlier. Last year, the number of juveniles passing by the dam in Red Bluff, at the northern end of California's Central Valley, was just 411,000. Approximately 95 percent of these winter-run Chinook eggs and juveniles did not survive, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ""Last year was very difficult for these Sacramento River fish because of the drought and heat,"" NOAA spokesman Michael Milstein told AFP. ""This year we had hoped would be better."" It wasn't. Although there were more adult fish spawning this year, so far there have been 22 percent fewer juveniles coming downriver, Milstein said. To date, only 217,000 juveniles have been counted passing through Red Bluff in 2015, versus 280,000 over the same period last year. The Sacramento Chinook, designated an endangered species in 1994, have been struggling for years, for a number of reasons, but the drought has only exacerbated the problems. Access to the historical spawning habitat of winter-run Chinook salmon on the Sacramento is cut off by the Shasta and Keswick dams, built in the 1940s. - 'Too warm for spawning' - The remaining habitat, below the dams, is too warm for spawning, so managers release dam water to bring down the temperature and allow the population to reproduce. ""But the drought has reduced the amount (of water) available, both for fish and for other uses,"" explained Milstein. He said rising air temperatures also raise the temperature of the water that remains. The migration

Seventy-five years after ballplayer turned spy Moe Berg dropped behind enemy lines, a new documentary illuminates the WWII service of ""Mysterious Moe"" Morris ""Moe"" Berg spent 15 years playing major league baseball. His record on the field was middling, but Berg was distinguished by his pursuits off it - namely, his time as a US spy during World War II. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Morris ""Moe"" Berg's dying words - ""How did the Mets do today?"" - were on brand for the 70-year-old New York native who enjoyed a 15-year career in Major League Baseball before America entered World War II. Sports columnist John Kieran called Berg ""The Professor"" on account of his reputation as an Ivy League-educated linguist and lawyer, a mentor and coach to younger MLB players, and a newspaper-devouring raconteur who earned fanfare as a repeat contestant on the NBC radio quiz show ""Information Please."" His 1972 New York Times obituary eulogized, first and foremost, the ""catcher in majors who spoke 10 languages."" But the brainy 6-foot-1-inch bullpen catcher with an unspectacular batting average had another career entirely: He was a World War II secret agent who gathered intelligence on three continents for the US government. ""We often think about athletes just playing ball and going in for records. But Moe, Ted Williams twice, Joe DiMaggio - they went off and risked their lives and their careers to serve,"" said filmmaker Aviva Kempner, who illuminates Berg's life and legacy in her 2019 documentary, "" The Spy Behind Home Plate."" Berg's particular line of work during the war - he ultimately served as a spy for the Manhattan Project while working for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA - further differentiated him.

text: Most Valuable Trade Asset on Every Contending National League Team. While the American League might be the more top-heavy league this season, the National League is stuffed with contenders, as at least six or seven teams this year have legitimate shots at the pennant. To do that, however, they will need to figure out which of their promising young prospects and aging veterans can be discarded in order to bring in a star to aid them in their pursuit of a ring. 7. Philadelphia Phillies: OF Adam Haseley Adam Haseley has been on the IL since a two-game stint with the Phillies saw him go 1-7 at the plate. A former No. 6 overall pick from Virginia, Haseley is a top-shelf contact hitter with great bat control. His game is the kind that translates very well to the MLB level, which could make him a very attractive trade chip considering a crowded Phillies outfield. 6. Colorado Rockies: 3B Colton Welker Third base in the Mile High City is currently occupied by this Nolan Arenado guy, who I hear is pretty good. That leaves Colton Welker without a clear path to the bigs. Still, with 27 extra-base hits and 41 RBIs for the Rockies' Double-A team in Hartford, Welker is likely to garner tons of interest as a potential trade piece. 5. St. Louis Cardinals: OF Dylan Carlson The switch-hitting Dylan Carlson, who has experience at all three outfield spots, should be up to the majors in no time at all given his production for Double-A Springfield. 31 extra-base hits and 11 steals in 69 games while providing plus defense is exactly the type of player that could bring a star-level veteran to St. Louis. 4. Chicago Cubs: LHP Adbert Alzolay Adbert Alzolay made his big league debut this weekend against the New York Mets, firing four innings of one-run ball. That performance was indicative of the type of player a potential seller could get in Alzolay, as his mid-90s fastball and 12-6 curveball that falls off the

No Major League team has repeated as champion since the 2000 Yankees, who won their third straight and fourth in five years. The Red Sox have had three opportunities since the ghosts were exorcised in 2004 to win back-to-back titles. But the headache from the previous October's celebration always has a tendency to linger, and no elixir so far has prevented the 2019 Red Sox from being affected either. They entered Saturday night's game against the first-place Yankees (37-19) with an 812-game deficit in the American League East, the Tampa Bay Rays between them in the standings, and in danger of dipping back to.500 with a loss. While watching them struggle to recapture their magic of a season ago, it's illustrative to remember how their other World Series championship defenses have played out, if only to acknowledge that we should have known this would be tough. 2005: The Red Sox actually finished with 95 wins, three fewer than in 2004, while tying the Yankees atop the AL East. But New York won the division title based on a superior head-to-head record. The Red Sox settled for the wild card, their title defense ending in a three-game wipeout at the hands of the White Sox, one of the more unheralded champions this century. General manager Theo Epstein, believing even championship rosters require alterations to counter complacency, made notable changes after the '04 catharsis Pedro Martinez, Derek Lowe, Orlando Cabrera and Dave Roberts were among the departures. The additions weren't quite as successful, unless you're some weirdo who enjoyed Edgar Renteria complaining about the Fenway infield and Matt Clement starting Game 1 of the playoffs. 2008: Another 95-win follow-up season, and another wild card. The Sox finished two games back of the Ray

Chelsea are fearful that Antonio Rudiger will be unavailable for selection at the start of the 2019/20 season, due to the knee injury he sustained back in April. Rudiger was forced to undergo surgery on his left knee meniscus after being taken off early during Cheslea's 1-1 draw against Manchester United, which ruled him out for the final month of the campaign just gone - including the Europa League final victory against Arsenal. According to The Telegraph, Rudiger is not expected to recover any time soon and will not be available for Chelsea's opening Premier League game of the season against Manchester United on August 11. The German centre-back has not suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from the injury and is said to be recovering well, but he does not wish to rush back ahead of schedule in fear of injuring himself again. He did just that against United, as he returned from injury early to face the Red Devils, only for the decision to dramatically backfire.

text: Astronomers discover massive ring of gas circling our black hole. The center of the Milky Way galaxy is somewhere you wouldn't want to be. We have it pretty easy here on Earth, orbiting our star and staying out of everyone's way, but deep within the heart of our galaxy, a monster lurks. It's a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A* (that's pronounced ""A star"", for the record) and while we can't exactly see it, we know it's there thanks to decades of scientific observations of our own galaxy as well as many others. The intense gravitational pull of the black hole draws in just about everything, but nearby debris it hasn't yet swallowed up orbits in a pattern called an accretion disk. Now, new research reveals that along with dust and super-heated gases, there's also a ring of comparatively cooler gases hanging out in the neighborhood. The research, which was published in a new paper in Nature, describes this ring of cool gas that had never before been detected, but ""cool"" is perhaps not the best term for it. The gas is still incredibly hot at around 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit, but that's a lot milder than the 18 million degrees Fahrenheit of the bands of hot gas that have been detected near the black hole in the past. How the various gases as well as the dust and other debris in the accretion disk gathered, and the mechanisms at work within the disk, remain a mystery. Going forward, the researchers want to further probe the inner workings of the area around the Milky Way's black hole and perhaps learn more about how it all works. ""We were the first to image this elusive disk and study its rotation,"" Elena Murchikova, lead author of the paper, said in a statement. ""We are also probing accretion onto the black hole. This is important because this is our closest supermassive black hole. Even so, we still have no good understanding of how its accretion works. We hope these new ALMA observations will help the black

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) Three people are dead in two separate shootings that happened within minutes and just a mile of each other in South Los Angeles. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were called out at about 8 p.m. to 11000 block of Berendo Avenue where police found three people suffering from gunshot wounds in the front yard of the residence. According to police, one man was pronounced dead on the scene. A teenage boy and another man were taken to the hospital where the teen later died. The third victim from this shooting is still receiving treatment. His condition is unknown. About 15 minutes later, deputies responding to a call of shots fired in the 1200 block of West 105th Street found one man at the scene with at least one gunshot wound to the upper torso. Two women were taken to a local hospital one with a gunshot wound and the other with severe head trauma. According to police, the victims were found at three different homes near each other. Police also said the shooting appeared to be a domestic incident, and a family member has been detained pending further investigation. ""A neighbor told me that someone was abusing their grandmother in the house, and a neighbor heard it, came in and started shooting,"" neighbor Curtis Cal told CBS2 reporter Chris Holmstrom at the scene of the shooting. ""Just another day in South LA."" Other neighbors said the family had been fighting back and forth for at least a week and a few days ago, someone's belongings including a washer and dryer were put out into the street. No arrests have been made. Police say they are still investigating.

text: Francesca's to close at least 30 stores this year as sales plunge 13 percent. Francesca's plans to close at least 30 stores this year as sales plunged 13 percent during its first quarter. The women's apparel and accessories retailer on Thursday reported a loss of $10.1 million on sales of $87.1 million during its first quarter that ended May 4. The Houston company reported a loss of $3.9 million and revenue of $100.4 million a year earlier. Michael Prendergast, Francesca's interim CEO, said the struggling retailer is still in the early stages of a turnaround, and that its first quarter performance is in line with its expectations. The company plans to sell off its current inventory by the end of the second quarter, offering steep discounts to consumers with the goal of offering new, better selling products later this year. ""As the composition of our inventory continues to improve with a higher percentage of new product, we believe we can drive meaningful improvement in comparable sales in the second half of the year,"" Prendergast said in a statement. RELATED: Francesca's to close at least 20 stores this year amid lagging sales Meanwhile, Francesca's is burning through its cash. The company reported $17.5 million of cash on hand at the end of its first quarter, down from $21.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 and $48.1 million at the end of the first quarter in 2017. Prendergast said Francesca's plans to cut $15 million in costs this year, negotiating with landlords to reduce rents and seek early lease terminations and close underperforming stores. The company closed eight stores during its first quarter, bringing its store count down to 722 nationwide. Debtwire, a publication specializing in distressed debt, issued a report last month that cast doubt on Francesca's future. ""Francesca's is confronting a host of issues that makes it challenging to complete the year without filing for bankruptcy,"" Debtwire said in its report. ""It does not seem likely that new management can quickly reverse the situation following a series of missteps over the past several years."" Prendergast, in a conference

text: Colorado immigrant groups prepare for possible deportation roundups Sunday. Colorado immigrants living in the country illegally are bracing for possible federal immigration roundups this weekend that could target people in 10 major U.S. cities, including Denver, and activist groups said they are better prepared after President Donald Trump threatened to order the raids last month. The news led Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and other Democratic elected officials to issue statements in support of the state's immigrants. Denver Public Schools sent notices to students and parents saying its schools were safe places. The threat of raids makes everyone in Denver less safe, Hancock said. When immigrants fear that they or their loved ones could be deported if they testify in court or go to the police, they pull back from the community. ""That is not OK for any of us,"" Hancock said. RELATED: Colorado immigrants wait nervously as threat of ICE deportation roundups looms Trump on June 18 first said ICE would target people with final deportation orders, including families whose immigration cases were fast-tracked by judges. Information leaked that the raids would occur in the early morning hours of June 23, but Trump then announced the operation would be delayed as a compromise with Democrats, who have opposed the roundups. The New York Times reported Wednesday night that the roundups would begin Sunday in major American cities including Denver, Miami, Atlanta, Baltimore and Los Angeles. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will focus on people who have final deportation orders, The Associated Press reported. Denver's elected officials frequently have been at odds with the Trump administration over the president's views toward immigrants. Hancock vowed that regardless of the federal government's actions, Denver will support people living in the country illegally. The city has a full-time immigrant and refugee office and has been working with community organizations on a campaign to make sure immigrants know their rights, the mayor said. The city also contributes money to the Denver Immigrant Legal Defense Fund, which provides legal representation to immigrants threatened with deportation proceedings. The raid is politically motivated, Hancock said. ""Every time there's an issue for him, most recently the Mueller investigation

Editor's note: Twenty-five years ago today, the Rockets defeated the Knicks in Game 7 of the NBA Finals at The Summit to win Houston's first major-league sports championship. The following story was originally published June 21, 2014. You can read our entire series about the Rockets' 1994 championship at HoustonChronicle.com/believeit ••• Two decades later, the images are still clear, as if Hakeem Olajuwon had just climbed down off one of the fire trucks that had made its way through downtown and allowed himself a moment to soak it all in. He remembered the sights of that day, from the Astrodome rally to the parade. He also recalled how he felt that day, how it filled him with a sense of pride and relief, triumph and accomplishment. He thought about that special series and season, about all it took for the Rockets to bring Houston its first major sports team championship. But more than everything that went into it, he remembered how it finally felt to be a champion. ""That was an experience that is really indescribable,"" Olajuwon said. ""It was unbelievable. Just to see everybody coming down, that's when you realize this series is over. We did it. ""You play both sides. When I was driving down to the game, you play, 'Man, to win...' Every once in a while you think you could lose that game so you know you might. To see that finally it's over, that we won it, and to see the excitement of the whole city at the same time celebrating... unbelievable. I mean, unbelievable.

text: Sports book would lose six figures on a Trubisky MVP season. We noted last week that enough bets had come in on Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to win the league MVP this season that his odds had shifted from 200-1 to 50-1. For one sports book, that means a big loss if Trubisky goes on to win the award. Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports book operations at Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, told the Chicago Tribune that the bets came in quickly when they listed Trubisky at 200-1 and the book will likely lose more than $100,000 on its MVP betting for the 2019 season if Trubisky ends up winning it. ""It was right from the get-go there was a lot of interest in Trubisky at 200-1,"" Kornegay said. ""That has really continued to a point where he is by far our biggest liability to win the MVP. When you're giving out 200-1 odds, it doesn't take much to create the liability. As it rolls in and you're accumulating hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars at 200-1, next thing you know you have a mid-six-figure liability attached to Trubisky. And that's the last thing I want to do is lose six figures on the NFL MVP."" Kornegay said the money has mostly been a lot of small bets, likely from Bears fans backing their guy, rather than a few big bets from sharp bettors. ""I just want to know what kind of water you guys are drinking up there,"" Kornegay said. ""Is everybody drinking, like, Soldier Field water or something? What the heck is going on up there?"" There's plenty of optimism in Chicago that the Bears can be even better than last year, and that Trubisky can take another step forward. If so, that's bad news for the sports book.

text: 3 Biggest Questions Nick Saban Must Answer at SEC Media Days. SEC Media Days begin next week, which marks the unofficial start of the upcoming college football season. The one guy reporters will be falling over themselves to talk to is Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Yes, Saban can be dismissive and intimidating, but you can bet he'll be bombarded with question after question, as the Crimson Tide are once again a favorite to win the national title. So, what should he be asked? Here are three questions Nick Saban must answer at SEC Media Days. 3. Does Alabama Have the Personnel to Replace DT Quinnen Williams? This isn't anything new for Alabama and Nick Saban. Year after year they lose impact players to the draft, but none bigger than defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who was the third-overall pick by the New York Jets. Even though he was constantly double and triple teamed, Williams still tallied 71 tackles, 19.5 tackles for loss and eight sacks. Former 5-star recruit Phidarian Mathis will have a great shot, but true freshman DJ Dale turned heads at spring practice and could be the top guy. Either way, Williams won't be an easy player to replace, as he was arguably the best defensive player in college football last year. 2. Can Alabama Continue to Fend Off Georgia in the SEC? Several years ago this would've been a laughable question, but Kirby Smart has turned Georgia into a powerhouse. However, Alabama has been able to fend them off in recent years, including the 2018 national title and last year's SEC title game. But can they keep holding Georgia down, especially as they compete yearly with the Crimson Tide in recruiting? 1. How Will Alabama Overtake Clemson in 2019? The Clemson Tigers have won two of the last three national titles, both against Alabama. That included this past championship game where Clemson routed the Crimson Tide. So, how will Alabama overtake Clemson in 2019, especially with quarterback Trevor Lawrence under center?

text: Yale, ex-basketball player settle lawsuit over expulsion. HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Yale University and a former basketball captain have settled a lawsuit stemming from his expulsion over sexual misconduct allegations that he denied. A federal judge in Hartford on Tuesday dismissed Jack Montague's lawsuit. Details of the agreement were not disclosed. Yale spokesman Thomas Conroy declined to comment. Lawyers in the case issued a statement saying only that ''the parties have resolved the case to their mutual satisfaction.'' Montague sought monetary damages over his February 2016 expulsion. He also sought readmission to Yale, but went on to attend Belmont University in Tennessee. Montague was expelled after the woman testified before Yale's Unified Committee on Sexual Misconduct that much of a 2014 sexual encounter with the player was not consensual. No criminal charges were ever brought. Montague's lawsuit alleges that the accusations against him were brought by a Title IX officer who coerced the woman to cooperate with the complaint by informing her that Montague had received sensitivity training in another case. His lawyers contend that is a violation of the school's own confidentiality rules. That earlier case had involved an argument in which Montague allegedly shoved a folded paper plate down a woman's top. Montague also asserted that the woman told Yale that he likely didn't hear her when she asked him to end the encounter. Yale's attorneys have said the woman, identified only as Jane Roe, made it clear that she did not want to have intercourse and that the school and its officials acted appropriately. Montague also argued that his accuser was allowed to give a lengthy, emotional statement to the committee, while he was denied a similar opportunity. Because of the expulsion, Montague, a guard, missed the end of his senior season at Yale, which included an Ivy League championship and first ever NCAA Tournament victory for the Bulldogs, a first-round upset of Baylor.

text: Gabbard arrives in Puerto Rico to'show support' amid street protests. White House hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) arrived in Puerto Rico Friday as protests rock the territory, making her the first 2020 candidate to visit since demonstrators began marching against the governor. Gabbard said she went to the island to ""show support"" for protesters who are calling for the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló (D) over allegations of corruption and leaked text messages circulated among his inner circle containing misogynistic and homophobic slurs. ""I'm here today to stand with and show support for my fellow Americans in Puerto Rico in their stand against corruption, and against a government that has proven it is of, by and for the rich and powerful, leaving the people behind,"" Gabbard said in a press release. ""These protests are about more than offensive language in leaked chats. They're about more than Governor Ricardo Rosselló and his associates' elitist attitudes. They're about rampant corruption within Puerto Rico's government that pretends to serve the interests of its people but instead exploits them, over and over again for profits and power. It is this blatant corruption that undermines people's faith in our democracy, our country and our values."" Gabbard also called on the Democratic Party and the other two dozen presidential contenders to call for ""this corrupt administration headed by Governor Rossello step down."" Rosselló has so far resisted calls to resign, instead offering apologies as he tries to govern through the scandal engulfing the island. The controversy was sparked when two former members of Rosselló's administration were arrested by the FBI earlier this month over allegations they directed more than $15 million in government contracts to favored businesses. The Puerto Rican Center for Investigative Journalism released the trove of messages among Rosselló and his closest allies, including at least two Cabinet members, that hammered journalists and political rivals. Several other White House contenders have expressed support for Puerto Rican protesters, including top-

text: The Jets' 4 strongest positions right now. After years of disappointment, the Jets finally have the pieces in place to return to contender status. There are still some holes to fill, but New York has plenty of talent on both sides of the ball. Factor in Gang Green's mix of youth and experience and you have a team that could make it back to the postseason sooner rather than later. So, which positions are the Jets strongest at right now? Here's a look at which positions New York is most talented at. Quarterback Danielle Parhizkaran -NorthJersey.com Sam Darnold still has plenty to prove, but there's no denying his talent. The USC product impressed throughout his rookie season and got better with each game. That alone is a reason for Jets fans to be excited about the team's future under center. Even past Darnold New York is in good hands at quarterback. Trevor Siemian is a seasoned backup. He might not be Josh McCown in terms of experience, but Siemian has been around the block enough to serve as Darnold's mentor in 2019. Davis Webb and Luke Falk also bring impressive arm talent to the table. The two put together standout college careers and have the skill set to contribute if need be. Everything centers around Darnold, but the quarterback room the Jets have put together is an impressive one. Running Back AP Photo/Julio Cortez In terms of star power and depth, running back might be New York's most loaded position on either side of the ball. Leading the way is two-time All-Pro selection Le'Veon Bell, who has a chance to be the Jets' best running back since Curtis Martin. Behind Bell is Ty Montgomery, who was once a starter in Green Bay and totaled over 1,000 yards from scrimmage in 2016. Further down the depth chart are Bilal Powell, Elijah McGuire and Trenton Cannon. Jets fans are no stranger to what Powell brings to the table and while McGuire and Cannon still have a ways to go, they showed flashes last season and have the potential to

text: Texans 53-man roster prediction: Quarterbacks. How a few years can change everything. Just three seasons ago, the Houston Texans dared to trot out a subpar group of quarterbacks consisting of an overpaid Brock Osweiler, a then-promising Tom Savage, and an over-the-hill Brandon Weeden. The result was a disaster. Now in 2019, the Texans' depth chart at quarterback is promising, deep, and set. After training camp and preseason is done, the team will enter the 2019 season with the below grouping: (1) Deshaun Watson (2) A.J. McCarron (3) Joe Webb III The leader of the pack is clear as daylight: Deshaun Watson will enter the season as the starter, and if you doubt that, well, how could you? With two seasons of play behind him - a seven-game 2017 ended by a heart-breaking torn ACL and full 2018 - Watson, the 12th pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, looks the part of a franchise quarterback, and then some. Despite playing behind a hodgepodge of ineffective offensive lineman in 2018, and throwing to a depleted receiving corps (outside of DeAndre Hopkins), the Clemson product threw for 4,165 yards and 26 touchdowns - to nine interceptions - on an uber-efficient 68.3% completion rate. He added 551 yards and five touchdowns for good measure. His 105.5 passer rating was sixth in the NFL. Watson is the first quarterback in NFL history to have over 4,000 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, 500 rushing yards, and five rushing touchdowns in a season. Now in his third pro season, Watson is widely considered as a top-10 quarterback, and some - including former pro Chris Simms - have him in the top-five. Caesars Palace has him as the 12th likeliest player to win MVP in 2019. That's a wrap on the QB Countdown. Appreciate you all following along even when the ranks trigger angry reactions. Lots of good discussion #simmsqb

An arrest report says Fabao Chen, 58, went to the Kroger on 27th and Broadway in the Parkland neighborhood on Tuesday and took a juvenile against their will. When passersby saw what was happening, they attempted to intervene -- but Chen pulled a gun from his pants and pointed it at them and then at the juvenile's head, the report said. Police said Chen then forced the juvenile to Double Dragon Restaurant, which Chen said he owns. When they arrived, a big crowd formed and multiple people tried getting Chen to release the juvenile, police said. Chen then pointed his gun at the crowd in what police called a threatening manner. Chen was eventually arrested by police at that location. Police also recovered his gun, which turned out to be a BB gun. During his arraignment, Chen told police the juvenile involved had been causing trouble inside of his restaurant. Chen pleaded not guilty Wednesday to kidnapping a minor and three counts of wanton endangerment. He was ordered not to have any contact with the restaurant.

text: For first time, sales of digital music match those of physical formats. Fueled by the popularity of streaming, digital music has matched and will likely soon surpass physical formats in the money it generates, a global industry group said Tuesday. The IFPI, the London-based body for the recording business, described the boom in streaming services as good news for the industry even though overall revenue still slipped in 2014. For the first time, digital and physical music sales were roughly even with each representing 46 percent of revenue for the industry, with rights for performances, films and advertisements making up the rest. ""I think we will be looking in the next couple of years at digital surpassing physical,"" said Frances Moore, chief executive of the IFPI, which stands for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. ""We are seeing that streaming is really leading the digital market, and we can imagine a time when digital will be the majority of music sales,"" she told AFP. Subscription services -- which allow users to listen to unlimited music -- still account for a fraction of the industry but revenue shot up 39 percent last year to $1.57 billion, according to the IFPI. The group estimated that 41 million people worldwide pay for music subscription services such as Swedish-based industry leader Spotify or Paris-based Deezer. In a sign of the expected growth of the market, hip-hop mogul Jay Z recently bought the Tidal streaming service which he relaunched in collaboration with stars including Madonna and Daft Punk. Amid the growth in streaming, physical sales of music as well as permanent downloads on sites such as iTunes kept falling. The drops contributed to the overall pictures for the global music industry -- revenue of $14.97 billion in 2014, down a modest 0.4 percent from a year earlier. But the picture had strong regional variations. The United States, the world's largest music market, saw an overall increase of 2.1 percent. Japan, whose slowdown in music sales has been a drag in recent years on the global industry, saw an increase in digital revenue for the first time in five years as streaming services took hold. CDs are still far more popular than digital music in Japan, which nonetheless saw revenue decline by

Ex-GP2 driver Sergio Jimenez sealed the first-ever Jaguar I-PACE eTrophy title a race early in New York, after title rival Bryan Sellers failed to start after his earlier qualifying crash. The New York win was only Jimenez's second victory of 2018/19, following his win in Rome back in April. But Jimenez remained in title contention by virtue of his consistency, finishing off the podium just once in the nine races to date. Jimenez entered the weekend just six points clear of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing's Bryan Sellers. But sportscar regular Sellers crashed in qualifying for the first race, clipping the wall on the outside of the Turn 13 left-hander, and RLLR was unable to repair the Jaguar in time for the race. That meant Brazilian Stock Car driver Caca Bueno became Jimenez's main rival - lying 16 points behind Jimenez in the standings. Bueno required victory and setbacks for Jimenez to take the championship in New York. Bueno was unable to find a way past in the first race, with none of the four Pro drivers able to make up positions in the race. A late safety car called for VIP driver and journalist Mark Hacking's crash at the Turn 10 hairpin, while battling Ziyi Z Zhang, meant Jimenez had to resist Bueno in a one-lap shootout. A rapid restart allowed him to pull a decisive gap on Bueno to seal the crown. Bandar Alesayi, competing for Saudi Racing, took the Pro-Am title after dominating his class throughout the season, with Yaqi Zhang his nearest rival for Jaguar China Racing. The Jaguar I-PACE eTrophy has averaged a grid of 11 cars in its first campaign and is currently evaluating its direction for the second season.

It's a player that Gase once coached in Miami. The Jets announced that they have signed punter Matt Darr to their 90-man roster. Darr was the punter for the Dolphins in 2016, which was Gase's first season as the head coach in Miami. He'd taken over the job by beating out Brandon Fields in a competition in 2015 and was out of the league after being waived in September 2017. He returned to action in five games for the Bills last year. Darr has an average of 45.4 yards per kick over his entire career. He joins Lachlan Edwards as the current punting options for the Jets.

Follow the rest of the series over the course of the next seven weeks. You can find Jamie Clarke's 'Big Phil' career overview here. In a managerial career spanning 37 years (and counting) Luiz Felipe Scolari has taken charge of some of the greatest talents to ever grace the game. Despite stints at Chelsea and even Guangzhou Evergrande, the pick of these players come from his World Cup winning Brazil squad in 2002 and his oh-so-nearly-men of Portugal from 2003-2008. Big Phil managed five players who had won, or would go on to win, the Ballon d'Or during his career, but only four of these make it to his all-time best XI. Let's take a look to see who made the cut. Goalkeeper & Defenders Ricardo (GK): The Portuguese keeper hit his peak for club and country during Scolari's reign as Portugal manager. He kept goal in two penalty shootouts for Portugal in major tournament knockout games. Both came against in England - the first in Euro 2004, where Ricardo also scored the winning penalty. The second coming in the 2006 World Cup, where Owen Hargreaves was the only Englishman who managed to beat him. Cafu (RB): Renowned as one of the greatest full-backs of all time, Scolari had the pleasure of managing the Brazilian at the peak of his career and winning the World Cup with him in 2002. After losing the captaincy under the previous coach, Cafu regained the armband under Big Phil and duly repaid him with triumph in Japan and South Korea. Lucio (CB): Along with Cafu, Gilberto Silva and Marcos, Lucio was one of only four players to play every minute of Brazil's 2002 World Cup triumph. He made a horrible error against England in the quarter-final, but Scol

text: Adam and Eve?? I have read the answers on here about Adam and Eve and the fact that they were perfect so therefore the deformities that happen now from incest would not have happened then. My question is though, Adam and Eve did not have Cain and Abel until after they were kicked out of the Garden of Eden, so therefore they were no longer perfect? So how would incest deformities not occur? Inbreeding leads to an increase in homozygosity, that is, the same allele at the same locus on both members of a chromosome pair. This occurs because close relatives are much more likely to share the same alleles than unrelated individuals. This is especially important for recessive alleles that happen to be deleterious, which are harmless and inactive in a heterozygous pairing, but when homozygous can cause serious developmental defects. Such offspring have a much higher chance of death before reaching the age of reproduction, leading to what biologists call inbreeding depression, a measurable decrease in fitness due to inbreeding among populations with deleterious recessives. Recessive genes which can contain various genetic problems have a tendency of showing up more often if joined by someone who has the same gene. If a son who has hemophilia becomes intimate with his sister who may have the same gene for hemophilia, and they have a child, the odds are in favor that the child will have hemophilia as well.n nSome anthropologists are critical of including biology in the study of the incest taboo, and have argued that there can be no biological basis for inbreeding aversion because inbreeding may in fact be a good thing. Leavitt (1990) is a good representative of this point of view, writing that ""small inbreeding populations, while initially increasing their chances for harmful homozygotic recessive pairings on a locus, will quickly eliminate such genes from their breeding pools, thus

text: Why do black people have different hair than white people? nan Different hair types evolved basically to protect the brain in different climate extremes.nWhite people evolved in cool climates, and so...for the most part...have limp hair that lays down on the head.

I was wondering cause my child has mild MR and they had tried putting her in a class for children with severe MR and she thought she didnt' belong and gave up actually I think she would of learned a little from the class. Now she is in some classes that she don't understand and is failing.Which specialist that does her testing out of the school said half the classes she has she isn't suppose to be in.. but does the school care... no Have you considered looking for a special school? I know my cousin, who is mildly MR went to a school for MR children and I believe they worked with them as individuals and it helped. Once he transferred to a public school, they also put him in with severely MR and they literally taught him the same thing for the rest o the time he was in school. I would help him with his homework and every year it was the same, it became too easy and boring because all he had to do was take a letter from the alphabet, and write down as many words as he could using that letter. I felt at the special school he was actually learning, while at the public school, they treated him like a nuisance.

Really complex, but interesting nnAyyavazhi  (Tamil: ""path of the father""), officially a Tamil monistic religion that originated in South India in the mid-19th century. The 'zhi' () in the word, 'Ayyavazhi', is a retroflex, ri.n nAyyavazhi functions autonomously. But since it was not recognised as a separate religion it was officially considered as an offshoot of Hinduism. Though it has not received official recognition, it has evolved into a distinctive religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in India's southern districts of Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin. As one of the fastest growing religions of southern India, its rapid growth had been noted in the Christian missionary reports of the mid-19th century.n nAyyavazhi focuses on Ayya Vaikundar; according to Akilattirattu Ammanai, the holy book of the religion, he was the Manu avatar of Trimurthi. The ideas and philosophy of the religion is based on the teachings of Ayya Vaikundar and the religious texts Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool.

It doesn't matter if it's a different sport; if he had signed a contract or made money, he wouldn't be able to play football. That's what happened to Jeremy Bloom, the WR from Colorado. He took money to train for the Olympic ski team and was declared ineligible by the NCAA to play his senior year. There is no way Samardzija will sign a baseball contract. He'll probably be the top receiver drafted in the NFL, and that equals HUGE money, unlike baseball where he would have to go to the minors and not see any big money unless he pans out as a legitimate big-league pitcher.

Among other accomplishments, it has given rise to models of human cognitive bias and risk perception, and has been influential in the development of behavioral finance, part of economics. It has also given rise to a new theory of the philosophy of mathematics, and many theories of artificial intelligence, persuasion and coercion. It has made its presence firmly known in philosophy of language and epistemology - a modern revival of rationalism - as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern linguistics.

text: What happened to the t.v. show called REUNION.. it was about students that were eluding police about murder..? this show was about a group of high schoolers and one of them supposedly killed another, the story was based many years later when the cop was trying to figure out who out of the group killed their friend... the show had lots of flashbacks to the time frame of the 80's? and they would give you slight clues all the way through it.... but they never finished the story, all of a sudden it just disappeared off the air... what happened? who killed who? and why is it not on the air to finish the story? Money problems/low ratings? bummer!!! It's as pure and simple as ratings. 'Reunion,' for instance, was cancelled by Fox in November. It had opened strong and had the support of ardent fans who complained loudly when the show was axed, but the fact is there simply weren't enough of such 'Reunion' followers to keep it from becoming a failure in audience share. Incidentally, many of those who wrote us about 'Reunion' complained it had been taken off the air before the central mystery had been solved.and wondered whether the show wouldn't return to the air long enough to resolve that question. The answer: it won't be resolved on air, but the network has now announced that Samantha's murderer was the illegitimate daughter she fathered with Will.

text: I have a bump on my left thigh. It is hard and not very big I'm just wondering what it might be? nan Depending on the size and shape of the ""bump"" it could be any number of things. It could be something as harmless as an in-grown hair to cancer. Any time you notice something on your body that is different for your ""normal"" appearance you should have it checked by a doctor. Only by looking at it and possibly by taking a biopsy (a sample of what is inside it) can you ever be sure. It is always better to be safe and find it is nothing than to do nothing and it be something. Hope this helps.

text: What is the scientific reason avacados, bananas, etc, ripen faster when placed in a paper bag? nan This is because bananas and avacados emit ethylene gas during ripening. This natural ripening hormone speeds up the process of turning those fruits into sweet-as-candy delights. By putting the fruits into a loosely closed paper bag, the ethylene gas surrounds the fruits, helping with the ripening process.n nnEthylene acts physiologically as a hormone in plants. It stimulates the ripening of fruit, the opening of flowers, and the abscission (or shedding) of leaves.

text: who invented the shoe? nan shoe, foot covering, usually of leather, consisting of a sole and a portion above the sole called an upper. In prehistoric times skins or hides may have been tied around the foot for protection and warmth; studies of the foot bones of ancient humans suggest that some form of sturdy footwear was worn by human beings beginning between 40,000 and 26,000 years ago. The shoes found with the 5,300-year-old “Ice Man” in the Tyrolean Alps were made of skins and braided-bark netting and stuffed with straw and moss. The sandal, a very early form of the shoe, was worn in Egypt, Greece, and Rome; a more ancient example (c.8000 B.C.), woven from plant materials, was found in an Oregon cave. An early form of the boot was also known in Greece and Rome. The characteristic shoe of the Middle Ages was the soft, clinging moccasin, which extended to the ankle. It was highly decorated and was of velvet, cloth of gold, and, increasingly, of leather. By the 13th cent. the toe had become greatly elongated until a century later the point had to be held aloft by a chain attached to the knee. After 1377 wooden clogs, called poulaines or pattens, were introduced. A forerunner of the heeled shoe, they were fastened under the shoe (if not a part of the shoe itself) to protect it from mud or water. The chopine, an ornamental shoe with a very high sole, went to fantastic heights. After 1500, styles reversed themselves, and the width of the toe was exaggerated; two colors and slashing were often employed to complement the costume. The high heel came into fashion with Elizabeth's reign in the late 16th cent. and was worn by both men and women; the shoe was colorfully decorated with rosettes, lace, and embroidery. France introduced (c.1600) the high-top boot which developed

text: are there links between children with autism and mercury poisoning.? nan Yes, there are. Autism rears it' ugly head too often shortly after receiving immunizations, I believe around 15 months, it's believed to be because of the MMR vaccine. But, I don't immunize, and my son has autism, so it's not exclusively from immunizations. He had signs from birth. That and the fact that it's very common to see autism in more than one family member, suggests that it can also be a genetic issue, too. The fact is, nobody knows for sure what causes it. But, when you look at the fact that thimerosol was heavily used as a preservative in immunizations, I believe around '98(don't quote me on that one, I learned all this a year ago so I might have the dates wrong) and we had a huge autism epidemic in 2000, you kind of have to raise your brow. I had a link that showed a study that was suppressed that says basically the amount of mercury in the MMR vaccine was so high, that it would only be safe if you were over 500lbs! Because this kind of information would cause an uproar, and would probably cause the immunization makers to go bankrupt when everyone stopped using them, it's not something that the CDC or anyone else is going to admit to until we've been poisoning our kids for another 30 years and they can get their facts. I will see if I can find that link about that study, I was infuriated to know that they found out about this six years ago and didn't share it with the rest of us. Just a side note: some believe that if everyone stopped vaccinating that all these diseases would take over. Well, it's a little known fact that when the immunizations first started, the diseases that kids were being immunized for had already been decreasing in new cases for YEARS. So, we really don't have any conclusive info on

Then from 21 to 30, 21, 26, and 28 were in there too. Now, that's like 14 of the 30 greatest NBA moments involved the Lakers.

text: How long would it take for an iranian Jew to get a green card to USA? nan Why do we keep getting questions with religion in them? We don't base entry on religion. Even the small minority here that has no faith in a higher power has faith in separation of church and state and preserving freedom of religion.n nThere will be no place to fill in your religion.n nIranians are, I suspect, from a 'country of interest' so it might take a little longer for a background check, and you'd need to fit one of the categories. I have no clue if Iran is in our diversity lottery, for example, but you should go to the US immigration service web page and check. They are accepting applications for 2007 right now, and if you win it lets you bring your spouse and children who are not yet of age.n nGood luck!

text: How many satellites orbit the earth? nan United States Strategic Command tracks objects orbiting earth. An AN/FPS-85 phased array radar, located at Eglin Air Force Base, is the primary sensor used to track these objects. The radar is capable of tracking objects the size of a soccer ball at 20,000 miles. The quote following is from USSTRATCOM's website (see first link). The second link provides additional information on the Eglin RADAR. n nFWIW, the Eglin RADAR is now receiving a major hardware and software upgrade under the SENSOR contract. ITT is the prime contractor and Northrop Grumman is the major sub.n n""USSTRATCOM tracks about 8,500 man-made space objects, baseball-size and larger, orbiting Earth. The space objects consist of active/inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, or fragmentation. About 7 percent are operational satellites, 15 percent are rocket bodies, and about 78 percent are fragmentation and inactive satellites.""

text: i think grease dripped off the pan and went to the bottom of the oven? how do i remove the grease when the oven is cooled, is this really bad? If you mean grease went under the oven cavity bottom panel down by the burner, ignitor, etc. Yes it's bad. Could cause oven grease fire if it's a lot of grease(more than a couple of tablespoons?) Unplug it. Wait until oven is cool. Take racks out. Most ovens have 2 finger screws holding the panel down. Sometimes you need a flathead screwdriver. Under the panel you will see the burner tube, igniter, etc. and the grease. First wipe most of it out with paper towels, then clean with soap. Make sure you don't touch the ignitor with oil, fingers, or soap. Put the oven back together.n nEven worse if grease got into insulation around the oven cavity through the top surface burners, it will smoke and/or catch fire when the oven is heated up. You could call for service, but probably easier and cost efficient to just buy new oven. Some maybe most service techs won't even touch an insulation/possible fire problem.n nIf it's just a grease spill in oven, just clean it up, if it's baked on it will be tough but follow the instructions of any chemical you might try, make sure of ventilation before you start.

text: What is the most common cause of blindness? Eye or brain fault? I was told it is faults in the retina, which worrys me as one of my retina is torn and was welded with lazer. What is the long term future. In the future will it they be able to feed signals direct into the brain for those who have damaged eyes. Globally the most common cause of blindness (and by a significant margin) is loss of transparancy in the lens/cornea. In the former case this is a cataract, and there are many infectious and other causes of the latter. In these cases the retina is often undamaged and sight can be restored with a relatively simple operation.n nIn the western world, macular degeneration related to diabetes is probably no 1.n nIf your retina was torn it has likely been 'welded' back onto the back of your eye where it should be by laser. This usually leads to some loss of visual field in the area which has been lasered, as the retina is effectively burnt there and does not recover. There is no reason to think that this will get any worse than it is now, however.n nWe are some way from bionic eyes at the moment.

text: I want to volunteer in Africa, what are some things to consider that aren't obvious? tips from people who have done similar things already? I'm in contact with some people who have been doing it for the last couple of years including the project manager but we're all pretty young. its in madagascar next summer for a few months to help out on a sustainable farming project, any comments or suggestions or literature is appreciated, thanks a ton. I was a Canadian intern in Uganda, and was surprised at the differences between what I had been told about the country and what I learned when I got there. The greatest things I learned were to be flexible and open to learning and challenges, let go of any ego, and let the local people teach you. Asking many questions, I was open to meeting people and that took me further than a travel book ever could.n nMy readings and country orientation provided ""essential"" information on medications (all the meds are dangerous and fatal, they are expired drugs sent from North America and are not for human consumption), animals/pets (all animals have Rabies), culture shock (it can be unbearable) and Malaria (ALWAYS take your drugs).n nWhen I arrived I chose to learn as much as I could. I lived in a non white neighbourhood, attended a non white church and learned to speak the local language. I was surprised to meet the white people. They lived in their own neighborhoods, and they warned me about the consquences of integration. They complained about the Africans, and that there were so many of them. The white people I met wanted to party with the other white people. There was one other group of white people I met, and they had come to ""help"" the poor Africans. When they realized that the Africans were doing very well (incredible amounts of knowledge, ability to identify and seek solutions to their problems), they decided they wanted to go back home to North America.n nBefore I left, I made sure I did the research. I had a basic understanding of the language and culture (what you

text: Why do people want to cut funding to the military? I understand billions of dollars go to the military but the one thing that government should do is have a STRONG military. It seems there are some, democrats, who want to cut funding whether we are at war or not. Do we really want a weak military? People want to cut defense spending, I think, because they have no concept of what the Federal Budget actually looks like. The 2007 budget is slated to spend about 17% on defense, while spending about 58% on entitlements and about 9% on interest on the debt. We could cut military spending all day and it would hardly dent the budget. We need to cut spending on entitlements (medicare, social security, medicaid, welfare) to get the budget and spending under control.n nIf you look at US military spending as a percentage of GDP, it is just about at an all-time recent low at 3.7% in 2003. This is very low. The USSR spent between 15% - 17% of it's GDP on the military in the mid 80's.

text: Are some men really bisexual? It seems to me that most men who say they are bisexual are actually gay but afraid to admit it to themselves. Every man I have ever met who claimed to be bi later confessed to being gay and said they were afraid to ""fully come out."" Some people limit bisexuality to sexual practices, arousal, and attraction only. However like homosexuality and heterosexuality it also includes things such as affection, love, and companionship. True some men use it at as a mere turning point but others are able to be comfortable with both men and women and may not be attracted to both equally and even have a preference. Some men feel that they don't have to choose because people want them to and thus they don't. For example a man can have relationships with mainly men during most his adult life but find a woman who he falls passionately in love with and ultimately spends the rest of life with. He could still be defined as bisexual despite him having a preference.

text: the proper way...? hi i want to know how to set a perfect table for christmas, where does what go?(spoon, fork, knife, glass, napkin etc.)?nThank you Instructions nSTEP 1: Figure out how many guests will be attending. If several children will be in attendance, consider having a children's table. If you would like the children at the main table, consider booster chairs if the children are small. STEP 2: Determine where everyone should sit. For convenience, the cook may want to sit near the kitchen door. Parents should sit next to their children. If there is a male guest, he is traditionally seated on the hostess's right. A female guest is traditionally seated on the host's right. For large parties, determine who would interact best with each other. Some people like to alternate between men and women, but this isn't necessary. You may want to use name cards to avoid everyone rushing for a seat at the last minute. STEP 3: Decide if you will use a tablecloth. If the tablecloth is white damask, you will need a pad under it to prevent it from slipping. Also, the middle crease should be arranged so that it runs in a straight and unwavering line down the center of the table from head to foot. When the tablecloth is on, it should hang down about a foot and a half if it is a seated dinner. If it is a buffet dinner, it should hang down to the floor. STEP 4: Set the table once you've adjusted the tablecloth. Begin by folding napkins and placing them in the center of each diner's place. STEP 5: Place the large dinner fork to the left of the napkin and the smaller salad fork to the left of the dinner fork. STEP 6: Place a salad plate to the left of the forks. The dinner plate should not be on the table when guests sit down. STEP 7: Place a knife to the right of

text: how do i gain weight? nan Sumo wrestlers only eat one time a day. It slows down your metabolism. The more you can eat at one sitting and the less times a day, the more weight you will gain. Also CARBS!!! Unexersized carbs create fat, and exersized protien. So eat meat-exersize, eat carbs and dont...and only 2-3 meals a day + the later at night you eat dinner the better.

text: How does your body eventually get rid of the viruses that cause a cold or flu? nan Before I start-penicillin is an antibiotic which kills bacteria, not viruses...it has no effect on viruses- In addition, penicillin is no longer widely used because there are so many resistant strains of bacteria, and is not used in general for respiratory infections. A flu shot is taken to keep you from getting flu, since it aids the immune system in recognizing the influenza virus.nOnce the body recognizes the virus, it produces anibodies, both circulating and on the surface of certain immune cells- Quickly, the antibodies will begin to stick to the viruses, often deactivating them-other immune cells come in, absorb the virus is a special way so that the virus is rendered harmless, and packaged into internal capsules called ""lysosomes"" which contain some very nasty molecules that destroy the virus itself.

To get a P visa, you have to show that the artist is internationally known, is coming on a reciprocal exchange, or is culturally unique.

text: Why do I get super sleepy after a lengthy workout at the gym? I eat healthy, go to gym 4x week, 2 of those visits are session with personal trainer. Saturday I went in with lite breakfast (banana & peanut butter) he guided me through weight training (moderately hard for me) and then I did 45 on treadmill. I drank plenty of water during exercise, go home had cooked veggies with shrimp, then felt very sleep, laid down for short power nap and sleep for 2 hours! Why the sudden sleepies? I am a workout junkie, and the same thing happens to me. Basically, your body has lost potassium, along with other minerals, and you have also worked muscles that now need to rest. As they start contracting, your body starts to feel the effects of it. n nMight I suggest eating more bananas and other foods with potassium, along with drinking Gatorade Fitness water. But, also realize, your body does need to rest from a hard workout, and as your metabolism has been increased, it is burning more energy faster, which can cause the body to feel fatigued.

text: what is time based maintenance? nan Example: If your car warranty is for 5 years, that is time-based maintenance. If it is for 50,000 miles, that is condition based maintenance.n nBecause aging equipment can have higher failure rates, today's utilities have to increasingly consider the efficiency of their maintenance and replacement policies.n nAbout 10 years after the current average 25-year service life, aging processes will gradually increase the risk of faults of a wave of components, dependent on operational conditions. Reliability may decrease severely unless effective measures are taken using additional knowledge of the physical condition of the component and its failure causes.n nCondition-based maintenance (CBM) avoids the high costs of intensified time-driven tasks independent of condition. It addresses specific, effective tasks to the needs as indicated by diagnostic inspections. In comparison with time-based maintenance (TBM) the benefits of CBM result from maintenance savings and lifetime extension. In that respect, CBM can provide a more adequate management tool to meet the terminal behavior of the equipment.

Also beta carotene is good and Vit A I think.

He turned down political offers to serve in the Mexican War, and was eventually made a Brigadier General. In 1852 he attended the Democratic national convention and, much to his surprise, won the nomination and the election. He tried unsuccessfully to promote conciliation between the North and the South and served only one term, losing in 1856 to James Buchanan.

text: how do you write a punk rock song? nan First off, asking how to on here is not a good start, and is definetly not very ""punk"". Depending on what part of the song you're talking about, there are many different answers to your question. But, no matter what part of the song, in order to write punk you need to have heart. You need to be passionate, and it needs to be believable. Otherwise, NO ONE will care.n nLyrics: These need to be real. Don't write about drugs if you've never tried them. Don't write about sex if you've never had it. Write what you KNOW. Write from the heart. It does NOT have to rhyme. If the emotion is real, people will feel it and connect with it, no matter how bad the words may be. Political is great in punk, but if you don't know what you're talking about, don't bother.n nMusic: This is where you might need a little experience. Luckily for you, it's punk, so it's going to be simple anyway. For guitar, just try messing around with power chord progressions, whatever sounds good will work. Try to make it so a vocal melody will fit easily with it, palm muting is a good tool but don't overuse it. Bass in punk, depending on the sub-genre, is usually pretty complicated. I'd definetly suggest writing just the guitar unless you're experienced on bass, otherwise, get a friend who can already play. Ditto with drums, and it needs to be a driving beat that doesn't overtake the message of the song.n nListening to a lot of punk will help you, but too much will handicap you in creating your own original STYLE. Most of the writing process is a hands-on, do it yourself thing, that can't be explained or taught.n nJust give it your best shot

And then go to a service near where you live. The best part of religious exploration is giving of your self. If you go to a religious meeting place and feel uncomfortable because you dont agree with them just leave. if your just uncomfortable become involved and ask questions until you learn enough to stay or need to try the next one on your list. Dont be lazy and just go with the first one. Explore and grow you will find the fit thats just right for you.n ngood luck and happy hunting

text: Catholics: Are we to be punished by death as in the middle ages according to Canon law? According to the late Pope John Paul II, the cannon law now reads nnCAN.1436 n$1. “Whoever denies or places in doubt any truth that must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or repudiates the Christian faith as a whole, and does not come to his senses after having been legitimately warned, is to be punished as a heretic or an apostate by major excommunication...”n n$2.”Aside from such cases, whosoever rejects a doctrine proposed, as definitively to be held by the Roman Pontiff or college of Bishops exercising their authentic Magisterium, or else excepts a doctrine condemned by them as erroneous, and does not come to his senses after having been legitimately warned, is to be punished by an appropriate penalty.”n nSo which “appropriate penalty” will they use, death, like in the middle ages? Is the pope trying to tell me that I will NOT keep the true Sabbath (Saturday) otherwise I will be punished. I suppose a lot of Muslims and even atheists will have a problem with this Canon Law, I certainly do? No one here has even attempted to address ""appropriate penalty"" which to me is a very vague and liberal phrase and can mean that any official of the Church can devise any penalty at any point in time as they so deem to be appropriate, which could be a slap on the knukles with a ruler as was once done, a slap on the face, as was once done, burning at the stake, which was once done. Anything. They would, however, have to obey the laws of a given land or be in violation of the conspiracy laws.

text: what is the Work-Energy Theorum? nan the work-energy theorem says that work is equivalent to energy.n nso, if you lift a 1 kg object 1 meter, you do some amount of work against gravity. if you do the math, you'll find that the work is W = 9.8 kg*m2/ss.n nthe work-energy theorem says that this is equivalent to a change in energy, so delta_E = W = 9.8 Joules.n nbasically it is a simple statement of the conservation of energy, where a change in the potential energy equals the work put into the system.n nnote that it only applies for conservative forces, like gravity or the electrostatic repulsion. if you are pushing something against friction, then there is an additional loss of energy to heat at the frictional surface, and the work-energy theorem does not apply.

text: what is better for post graduation MS or MBA? MS in biomedical or aeronautical engineering? and MBA in any field When considering which program to choose, always consider where you are heading in the future. This is the most important factor when comparing these two programs. Both degrees will serve you well, and whether one is better than the other depends solely on your career goals and how you plan to utilize your degree.n nTypically, an MBA program offers a more general education than an MS. nHowever, MBA programs are constantly evolving, and they now tend to put more stress upon specializations and concentrations.n nAnother thing to consider is that MS programs are not subject to rankings like MBA programs are. Therefore, the prestige that is carried with MS programs is much less discriminating. n nnAcademically, both programs are usually similar in difficulty. nThere are some that say students in MS classes tend to be more academically inclined because they are there for different reasons than MBA students. This opinion is based on the thought that people who are going for an MBA are in it for the money, the career, and the title. Where as MS students are in it for other reasons-- most of them academic in nature. n nBecause not all schools offer an MBA and not all schools offer an MS in business, your first decision will be to decide which is more important, your program of choice or your school of choice. nIf you’re lucky, you can have it both ways.n nGood Luck.

text: Ive been eatting a lot of shrimp for protein...Good idea? nan Ooohhh...that sounds so good...u r making me hungry.n nShrimp are anything but small in their nutrient density. Its an excellent source of selenium and unusually low-fat, low-calorie protein--a four ounce serving of shrimp supplies 23.7 grams of protein (that's 47.4% of the daily value for protein) for a mere 112 calories and less than a gram of fat. Shrimp also emerged as a very good source of vitamin D and vitamin B12. n nMany people are confused about the fat and cholesterol content of shrimp. Though shrimp is very low in total fat, it has a high cholesterol content (about 200 milligrams in 3.5 ounces, or 12 large boiled shrimp). n nI believe eating in moderation is the best. Try to get proteins from other sources of food too like lean white meat, beans and legumes. But hey...nothing wrong with treating those tastebuds to some scrumtious shrimps occasionally....yummy!

I am a nearly 40 year old bloke with 2 kids and i will admit that even if i did not have any kids i would still watch rate the Simpson's as being the best cartoon ever.n nDoooh - Ummmmmmmmm Dooooooughnut I remember a Simpson's Christmas episode that i thought really said something about the American way of life! The episode were Homer gets no Christmas bonus so he has to go to the dog track to try to win Christmas money for his family. He bets on Santas little helper who proceeds to loose the race and all Homers money. Homer is devastated until he sees the dog being kicked out of the race track to the street. Homer takes him home as his only gift to his family.....and they loved the dog and had a great Christmas. As Americas we can all get caught up in rent,bills money,,,but deep down,,,we are a great society that does understand what life is really about..Americans rule! Since you said BLOKE I figure you must be from England and i wont be getting the best answer! lol
