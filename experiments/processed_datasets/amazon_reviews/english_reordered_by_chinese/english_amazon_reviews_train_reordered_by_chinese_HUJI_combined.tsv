First tried this at a vacation rental. Gave my kiddo sense of independence and confidence. Gave me the ability to let go. I was with him in the water, but I didn’t have to be in constant contact. Way more fun for both of us.	positive
"I have not yet received the ""Mommy To Be"" White Lace Sash and ""Dad To Be"" Pin Pack. On-line it stated that it was delivered on April 8th accompanied by the 2 Grandma To Be Pins in the residence mailbox. I received the 2 Grandma To Be Pins but not the other order. Please check into this matter ASAP. Perhaps its a delay or mishap."	negative
Once again, Mr. Thornhill has hit the ball out of the park. I truly appreciate how Mr. Thornhill uses current issues in his books, giving his readers an opportunity to view the subject matter from different perspectives. As usual, the usual cast of characters bring humor and interest to the tale, even when dealing with such a controversial topic. Keep them coming, Mr. Thornhill, you have an appreciative audience.	positive
Don't work in car, it's very width	negative
Much smaller than pictured. Do not care for this small pierce . Will be returning.	negative
Did not work well for me	negative
Love the bright colors. Sequins are attached well but not the seams! Unfortunately the seam split after having it for less than two weeks. Item not eligible for return from vendor, unfortunately.	negative
Connected 4K Roku to receiver via this cable. Many drop-outs, blank screens, digital noise. Replaced with another cheaper looking cable I had lying around and all issues went away. Seems I got a dud.	negative
Did not charge my psp well at all	negative
Bought for my granddaughter, she was very happy and sizing is a true size.	positive
Perfect just what I wanted. I was glad it had a strap.	positive
This fit me weird. I guess is my of body but the bottoms were too big but the top was beautiful just an inch shorter than I'd like on my long torso	positive
Have been using it now for two weeks. Initially planned to use it for 5 or so nights as i moved to a new place and had a gap between my furniture arrives. But now, two weeks later it is still inflated and my toddler baby is using it as her day bed. So it really had a rough treatment. So far it holds up!	positive
great food coloring with no after taste, perfect for red velvet cakes	positive
Honestly these are weird. Feels more the sprain support compared to a zen experience. Save your money or invest in Badger brand foot balm.	negative
It's great and I love it I just wish that to the markers didn't come with the caps off so that they were dry and don't work	positive
I would not recommend this item. It took a considerable amount of time to connect. The quality is not good.	negative
Works as advertised. No complaints	positive
Not sure if this item is necessary...I don't see any changes. I like the fact you can charge it.	negative
Hydraulics leaked in less than 90 days, chair arrived with cosmetic damage	negative
Shredded up after 6 cuts.	negative
I gifted this to a good friend that had a necklace similar to the earrings. She just loves them.	positive
Very attractive white semi sheer curtains, the light comes through but offers privacy. They were truly what I wanted. Great value for the price.	positive
Very small not satisfied	negative
Case is loose and nearly fell of the phone. Does not protect well	negative
I ran this fan on high for almost 3 hours. Battery life is better than advertised. It moves more air than the 7.5 inch plugin fan I have. Loving it so far.	positive
Functions flawlessly one is so sturdy and totally worth the price you are paying for! They also charge quickly. I have these all around the house. I feel more secure with this cord.	positive
Good for the price nice clarity	positive
The case cannot secure the watch as it is supposed to. Don't buy.	negative
Fast turnaround with this vendor. I love Sheaffer pens and this one did not disappoint.	positive
I expected it to taste unique and not like syrup, figured it should taste ok but less sweet, but this tastes like just plain seltzer with fake sugar substitute. All three types were crap... Waste of hard earned money.	negative
Simple to use and appears of good quality.	positive
This was as good a story as any I have read. Written very much in the David Baldacci style. Xxx	positive
This is a great addition to pancake and waffle batters, especially made from scratch and/or yeast-raised. Easier to balance the taste and the moisture level of the batter than with liquid buttermilk.	positive
Part of a costume for hippie fest.	positive
I gave this as a gift and was told today that this never worked and Also destroyed to VCR tapes while she was trying to make it work.	negative
does what it is supposed to do.	positive
Haven't used yet but company is super easy to work with	positive
Used it for a very short while and phone froze! Its DEAD! Seller is not very helpful... JUNK!!!	negative
A gift for my daughter.	positive
These are great but I've purchased 2 of them and they aren't very durable. I'll keep buying though.	positive
We really like the quality of this trimmer, and it does an excellent job trimming around the fence line, shrubs, and our many trees. My only issue is that it is a bit on the heavy side; which is caused by the battery weight and the fact that greenworks built it to last. Very easy to change an attachment.	positive
It feels noticeably heavier than the Apple brand cable. I love how low profile these are! Arrive on time. The packing is fine. It's worth so much money. A cable that was long enough and sturdy enough to hold up to using it on my Apple devices. The braided cable looks sturdy and so far, it has worked well. The length is very good. The speed is very fast. Family all like it. Super value products Will buy next time .	positive
very comfortable but for $30 i would hope these flip flops could give me at least a few years worth of wear. couldn't believe the toe strap broke in the middle of my trip. how disappointing	negative
Works great so far. Great color and texture. The only minor (minor) issue is this: the velcro strap that allows you to wrap the wire up and secure it doesn’t fit over the plugs, so instead of conveniently adhering to the wire at all times, even when not being utilized, it is unattached.	positive
Great quality! Stands up through sprinklers, heavy duty, good size, polite and to the point, and actually blend in well so they are not obnoxiously obvious in the yard	positive
What the description did not say is that the lens is plastic instead of glass and since I use this as a meat thermometer I am worried it will melt--a glass lens would make it more durable. probably OK if used in a cool environment but not around a stove or barbecue	positive
Not for drowning out snoring. They will work for anything else.	negative
Use it daily! Great machine and easy to use	positive
This product comes much too large to use on a laptop. My computer is 15.6” and it towers over the mouse area.	negative
This is very thin and cheaply made. Really expected heavier fabric for the price.	negative
Love the bag... pockets are much bigger than they look! My 8month old GSD weighs about 50 lbs right now and he bag is a bit too big for her. My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars) is that the straps do not stay tight. If we go for a walk or run the straps end up loosening and then the bag starts sliding off her. I am hoping when she fills out a bit more we won’t have a problem with having to have the straps so tight.	positive
Doesn't connect, doesn't turn off/on easily, horrible	negative
Amazing quality! Especially for this price!	positive
I ordered the iPhone x case and I got this. I order on Amazon often and this is the first time anything like this has ever happened	negative
It needs Velcro or something to keep it under their chin. Falls off pretty quickly.	negative
The makeup is so watery and does not go on well.	negative
The battery life is very short always need to take down and recharge. Also they fall frequently from cabinet.	positive
I have really thin hair and these work. This is my favorite style of clip.	positive
It's perfect Looks just like the picture	positive
My kids have had so much fun with these! Only problem is that they break easy and the connections are a little hard for my little ones to get together. But for the price I’m willing to replace them when they break. My kids have been able to make different shapes and swirls and enjoy using their imaginations	positive
Meh, it’s ok. Sometimes it works great other times, even when there is plenty of bubble liquid, it blows very few bubbles. For the price I expected a little more.	negative
Oh my oh my, this us the second pair because I had to exchange the first pair as the button hole was closed, leaving no way to button them. The send second pair arrived just the same. My neighbor is a seamstress so she cut it but what a pain and she's not sure it will hold up long. Not a happy customer.	negative
This product was a waist of money. Did not work as advertised. Will say hand sowed seeds and covered with straw they did grow. There is nothing hydro seeding about this.	negative
This is exactly what we were working for and has held up under the strains of carrying daily lunches for a middle-schooler!	positive
It’s alright but the cut of the top looks very awkward and unflattering around the armpit	negative
I started with too fine of a bead, then I switched to this, worked great for removing old finishes.	positive
"I ordered these for my grandson. They are extremely smaller than they show to be in the ad. It should say ""enlarged to show detail"" or something to that effect. My grandson was very disappointed with them."	negative
They are heavy for swimsuit and really don’t do much	negative
The bars that arrived were old and discolored. They were inedible. Usually these granola bars have a shiny chocolate coating and pieces of course sea salt. I contacted the seller and never received a response.	negative
The holder's pad clips and/or pad rattles when empty and when in use. The holder's bottom support clip does not accommodate my Galaxy S5 OEM cord. Despite these nuisances, I use it often. Would not buy it again.	negative
Received a portfolio not a standard case!	negative
This tent was affordable but I was disappointed overall. Setting it up was fairly easy at first but I found myself struggling to finish securing the canopy portion. The tent blew over in about a 10-15 mph breeze and one of the metal supports snapped, even though I staked down each corner of the tent. I wish I’d bought weights. Next time I will pay more for a more durable tent.	negative
This is absolutely the best warmer we've bought! Love the dimmer - so we can use it as a night light and then turn it up for fragrance during the day. The only draw back is that it takes an unusual light bulb. It is not easily swapped out. You'll need tools to take it apart when the bulb dies.	positive
This arrived in a pool of itself. The packaging was terrible the product was all over the inside of the box. I'll never buy from them again.	negative
Great deal fast service	positive
Didn't do anything, unless you never clean your ears. Waste of money!	negative
The only hangers I will use! Nothing falls off of them....	positive
The camera itself looks nice and sleek however I am not sure how to mount it. There are no directions for it. The instructions for the actual camera are not clear at all. It almost looks like a kindergartner wrote the instructions. I'm having a hard time getting this thing started.	negative
The headphones are slightly heavy on the head. The noise canceling is good and the sound quality is good. I would definitely recommend buying these headphones for the average listener. You are not going to be blown away by the noise cancellation or sound quality, but I overall a good set of headphones.	positive
I really liked this movie! It did look a little cg'ish on my 4k TV though. But that is the TV's fault, not the movie.	positive
Poor quality waste of money.. It only lasted a week. Don't waste your money.	negative
I found this has the most satisfying and authentic taste for use in cooking, and the price makes it good for saving against the purchase of many smaller containers if you use it enough. If you don't use it that much, you're better off forking out more per ounce on a smaller size.	positive
I love this mirror! Super cute and a lot bigger than what I thought it was gonna be.	positive
I have noticed some results. After one treatment, the next day my nails looked cleaner. It's been a week now and still good results even though things are moving slowly. This is the best product that I have found after years of other products. I have some hope now.	positive
I kept sliding down the ramp. Returned it. This is too big to travel on airlines as well. It would almost take up an entire large suitcase.	negative
You the chest strap attachment in this kit is super sick. Strapped that thing on when riding motocross yesterday and came up with some killer shots. I forgot I was even wearing it most of the time	positive
It takes so long to take the bill in don’t buy I bought 3 for my store is not worth the money $30 is fare	negative
Worked well now hope it will stay closed	positive
They are very good gloves.there soft to work with.	positive
The product was damaged but I can't return the product.	negative
I paid for a 16 slot organizer, i recieved a 12 slot. frusterated. now i have to figure out if it's worth it to return to sender cause of this piece of ****. DO NOT order from this company!!!! plus they charged me for the more expensive one too!!!!! & they sent the wrong color!!! will update when i can get a response	negative
My whole box came melted	negative
I'm not a photographer, was just trying to improve light when taking pictures of things I was selling on offerup. It helped a bit.	positive
"6 inches, anyway I measure.. I order ""2 large"" pieces and they were VERY small seems.. won't be ordering them buyer again SNS.."	negative
DEADLY DESIGN! Purchased these to put on my dogs collar because she escapes our yard sometimes and I want to be able to find her fast. Had this chewed open in a few days time. Button batteries are deadly to children and pets! Do not take the chance with your loved ones! DO NOT BUY!	negative
Very poor material. Also very messy and could not see the imprint well. Was also discolored along the edges.	negative
"Maybe I except too much out of earbuds, even if they're ""durable"", but I was nevertheless disappointed when these stopped working less than six months after I got them, with only three months of continual use. One side went out first, and then the other followed suit. Cordless ear buds are looking more and more favorable. The sound was good for the price, if a bit heavy on the lower ends. Gets the job done."	negative
The cups are good and sturdy. Great for my baby shower.	positive
Does what is supposed to do, but not for long wear, it irritated his groin area. He was sensitive and in pain for a couple of days.	positive
The group of stories are well put together. It is nice going through them.	positive
Huge gash opened in slide on third use	negative
meh is all I can say	negative
Beautiful design. Came early.	positive
No more single pieces for me. This one big piece no slip for bathtub is great! A little tricky to put on but stays in place and we don't slip.	positive
I bought this to replace an older dirt devil but the one is like it's cheap cousin. It works pretty well for the little I use it but it doesn't feel sturdy at all. I don't think it would be good for daily use or high traffic places.	negative
Keeps the straw and mud out of the house. Makes life a lot easier. It works and looks good.	positive
Unfortunately we didn't think to test these until we went on vacation, and 1/3rd of our order was broken, and it was past the return deadline. Otherwise would have been a great deal.	negative
1. The product came laden with a very high chemical smell. 2. The pads have scratched my glass aquarium. I would not recommend this product.	negative
I got both colors. The black one I don't recommend as it leaves tiny black lints that can go in with the pumped milk. I didn't find the issue with the pink one.	positive
I received the box and the part between the base and the seat was not enclosed. I reached out to the company and they do not carry parts so I have to exchange. I do not know if I will re-purchase this.	negative
Opening is good the settle down starts to smell a little cheap but then picks back up after a while, good cheap fragrance	positive
Case returned... The magnet was so weak it would not stay together to hold the case up	negative
They sent me two sealing rings. One of them was broken, so I texted them and they sent me a new set of sealing rings	positive
The smell is too strong I wouldn’t put this on my baby girl, I probably wouldn’t wear it all the time either.	negative
I installed these on my 2017 GMC Sierra to cover the 2 stake holes for installation of a tonneau cover.	positive
Nice compact design, but unfortunately mine stopped working one day after receiving it.	negative
Loved the hair brush straightener. After using a heat protector, my hair turned out smooth and straight.	positive
"I ordered this as an ""add-on"" to a table centerpiece. I received a hair piece instead of butterflies..."	negative
I order the dress M but it came so stretched and long.	negative
I store my bike on my front porch and I’m always worried that the elements will get to it. This cover completely solves that problem. The fabric is durable and easily fits over it. I especially love that easy access for my bike lock. I would definitely recommend purchasing.	positive
Not happy. Less than a month and is starting to peel off.	negative
"I loved the cover, but it wouldn't fit on my new 10"" thick futon mattress. So I will have to return it."	positive
Sound quality is acceptable, but battery life is nothing near what's stated. They only last about two hours (after a 52 hour charge). They also switch modes on their own. I'll be listening and suddenly one of them will announce it's changing its operating mode. You might end up with just the left bud continuing to work, or they might both stop playing. Very disappointed after having read the other reviews; but the old adage is you get what you pay for. (I WISH REVIEWERS WOULD USE PRODUCTS FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE WRITING REVIEWS.)	negative
Lasted less than 3 years for occasional use.	negative
I'm really pleased with this item. I am always rushing in the morning and never have time to look through my earrings, so I end up wearing the same ones for months. This book makes it so easy to keep earrings organized. I'm excited to start wearing all my earrings again.Cheap price and good quality	positive
Thin, easy to install and perfect for wrap around case too!	positive
They have delivered me a broken guitar.	negative
Bristles break apart from handle and bamboo is not treated with a nice smooth finish. Feels like a dry piece of wood every time you brush.	negative
So easy to put together!! And love that it fits multiple pot sizes. You can’t tell it’s adjustible with pot inside. But thinner than expected.	positive
Poor quality. Zipper was broken before getting it on	negative
Didn’t work on my bike and kept blowing the fuse. Company tried to say the problem was with my bike. Ordered from someone else and returned this	negative
Very comfortable. I feel wealthy when I am wearing it.	positive
For glare and rain very good.the looks of my last post was better but I believe this pr.may have a more stable frame	positive
Like the other reviewers I've had issues with stripped screws and difficulty getting wires in. Not worth the hassle.	negative
Does what it supposed to do	positive
I use this on the side of my refrigerator at work. For the most part I really like it and it does what I expect it to do. If I get a little too rambunctious, I have pulled the whole thing off of the refrigerator, so I think it would be perfect and 5 stars if it had a bit stronger magnet on it.	positive
I use this product for strengthening my upper back and arms. I only use the heavy band and it works well. I doubt I’ll use the other two weaker strengths.	positive
This leaves streaks and smears everywhere. I wouldn't touch this stuff again. Even if it was free, I'd toss it out	negative
I ordered this for my mother for Mother's Day. She LOVED this machine the first month but has had nothing but problems with it for the last 4 months. It leaks while brewing and it doesn't even turn on sometimes. Now, it won't even turn on at all for her to make her cappuccino. Extremely disappointed that I spent this much money for something to break less than 6 months later. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!	negative
Very satisfied. Usually there's a smell in this kind of pad before use, but this one smells fresh and can be used directly without wash! ( I am such a clean freak and sensitive to weird smells)	positive
This is about the cheesiest seat I have ever seen and for the price it is pitiful. The fabric cover is very light weight and cheaply sewed. The buckle that goes together is extremely hard to work and my 7 year old granddaughter had to come to me to take it apart. Looks much better then it really is and I believe it should at least operate easily for a child as that is who it is intended for.	negative
So cute and good quality!	positive
This planner has been very useful, and everyone who sees it loves it. It attract great energy! The planner is functional, and keep me in line. I would suggest anyone to purchase it.	positive
Smaller then I thought	positive
Cannot keep buttons on this jacket. very cheap poor quality	negative
I used this as a photo booth backdrop, worked great.	positive
Does not work! I have a 7 Plus and it doesn’t work at all.	negative
I never recived my order	negative
This nailer is awful. It came with brad nails and it does not push them in half way. I ended up hammering them the rest and some bent causing damage to the wood. I am returning immediately. Unfortunately I ordered more brad nail sets that didnt come in so they will have to go back to	negative
I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait for hubby to redeem the coupons.	positive
These are absolutely beautiful! I like that it comes with a card for all the ways to wear these! they are reversible too! well made and a great bargain! thinking about ordering another round!	positive
"Their voice response system is very difficult to navigate and get to the point where you can actually speak with a real person. They don't respond in the time frame they say they will (for instance ""you will receive an email back from us within 48 hours."") Bull. I would not buy a Square Trade warranty ever again. Ever."	negative
Meh? Cute and worked good as a handle. Wasn't strong enough to keep my phone afloat, but can make it easy to spot in shallow or clear water.	positive
Machine works well, magnet seems less strong than machine from Grainger	positive
Never got the olives broke in transit	negative
I selected this feeder because it promised ease of cleaning. Instead of having to unscrew the base of the feeder, two spring loaded tabs are depressed and the base pops off. Great idea, but the first time I cleaned it one of the tabs flew across the kitchen and could not be reattached. I am still using the feeder but have to cram a little piece of wooden matchstick in the hole.	negative
Not actual size. Runs about half a size small. Normally I am an 8 but I need an 8.5 in this shoe. Also if you have wide feet, you may want to go up a full size. The straps are a little tight.	negative
We use this Sunday mornings for the youth at our church. They work great, we love them!	positive
They way it look the advertisement appears to look like you getting more than one can.	negative
awesome daily devotional. My 15 year old daughter has really enjoyed it. Very solid teaching.	positive
Works perfectly for storing my AMA-mini media player. I read complaints that there was no Velcro strap to secure your device, but there is actually one that secures it to the flat center piece so I was happy to find that feature. It was a perfect fit for what I needed it for and feels really sturdy and well made.	positive
Just like the picture!	positive
I really like these lights. 2 issues, though: 1. One end of each string of lights has an approx 1” white battery pack. So you have to be able to hide it, unless you’re ok with that look. I was not. 2. Also the battery life is short. I left a couple of mine on overnight, and by next morning those strands were dead.	positive
Very disappointed. For the price, I thought they would sing the words to the songs so my grandson could hear and learn the nursery rhymes. I do not recommend this at all.	negative
At the waist it was too big where it bows out	negative
Not as stretchy as I was hoping.	positive
They are pretty but the pearls started falling falling off as I was taking them out of the package. Not very happy about that. Don’t care for needing to piece them back together or the possibility of more of the pearls falling off. 🙁	negative
Product ran significantly smaller than advertised. I read other reviews, but I did not see anything about it being small. It was form-fitting not loose and flowy.	negative
Unless you are a seamstress don’t bother. It fits really strange on my little one.	negative
Rotate the ball clockwise or counterclockwise to scroll up or down the page. I thought the silver edge did this, but I was wrong. This performs fine. The driver from the website did not work, windows driver did work.	positive
I have been using the hard side holder for a few months but it became too cumbersome for the number of cards I have to carry. This one is easier and has more room for cash. And I haven't spilled cards all over the store floor since I got it.	positive
Not great, hard to open.	negative
This was a replacement pair for ones that were broken smd the plastic nose clip cracked after minimal use. With the issues we have seen with vanquished I would not recommend them for competitive use or practice	negative
good little saw but broke the blade cover off after 2nd using . company quickly replaced it for free.	positive
It is not only slots machine, but winning clubs,contest, and the best for free chips on the fan page.	positive
The knife itself is just fine, nice quality, and I really like the case. However, the sharpening tools were not sent. I contacted Amazon and they had me reorder and gave me a label to return the first one. The second Hori Hori arrived...and, you guessed it...no sharpening tools included!! What a rip off!! I'm contacting Amazon again!	negative
Overpriced, lower level french pate. If you like dog food, this is for you.	negative
These are ok. They have a strong medicine smell. I choose them because they are on subscribe & save	positive
Works good, but doesn't seem to have the power my old dinosaur of a hand mixer had that I bought back in the early 90's. Happy with it, though.	positive
Worked for 3 days and burned out.	negative
Be careful with sizing. I ordered a size up and they were way too big. They are constructed of thin materials but seem very warm.	positive
Junk. Springs that were suppose to hold batteries fell out upon opening. Not installed properly. Will not last 2 weeks!!!! Don't buy it! I was out of town and missed return date by one day. Can not reach Amazon so I am out 10 dollars.	negative
Awesome sleeves, great quality.	positive
Only wear two times an it change	positive
Don't use liquids if you don't want them covering everything in your lunch bag. The only thing good about them is their size.	negative
Dis honest seller! I really thought I was getting the pair which I was wanting the smaller one. This is bull shiz Amazon, not happy at all!	negative
Daughter likes them but very cheaply made	negative
I bought this damn thing so that I wouldn't have to style it. So much for that	negative
The shampoo bottle was not sealed , as a result, a lot of it was spilled out in the package. The shampoo also has a rotten smell.	negative
Love this pillow for myself. My baby doesn't care very much for it. Average price.	positive
Cheap quality, but functional.	positive
Very easy to install, and the kiddo (3 year old) can reach it no problem.	positive
"The bracket is universal for most bikes. It will need a test fit. The allen head nuts are a weird size.about 0.10 "" or 2.5 mm nuts 5/16"" , Captive nuts are hard to start. I wish the screws were longer. The rear reflector will have to be moved the back rail"	positive
Great earnings. They are beautiful.	positive
Cute beds, easy to put together, but the smell is overpowering. Formaldehyde perhaps? I washed the bedding and have left the beds outside for 2 days to air out and they're still too strong to leave in my child's bedroom. Daughter is really upset that she can't play with her Christmas gift yet!	negative
These bookends are super cute and LOOK great, but they are NOT functional for kids! They only hold books up if they are tightly against the books, but it is VERY difficult to get the books to fit in there and they get pushed over very easily. It's too much of a hassle to return, so I'm keeping them, but they are more of shelf decorations and are not functional.	negative
It is a cute notebook and i dont hate it but honestly it is not worth the money. Like the binding is so fragile, i ripped out just one page and the binding is kind of messed up and maybe will start to fall apart sooner or later. I was really hoping to love it it but sadly it did not, so i would not repurchase again.	negative
Ordered two organizers and they both came in cracked and scratched after week of waiting. I’d return then if there was no fee for shipping. It seems like case is thick enough even though it’s cracked and scratch. Going to keep them but it’s not for long term item.	negative
Just as it’s described. Very useful, and a must for manual machining.	positive
A great read on what's going on in the non-published world.	positive
I loved the colors but was extremely disappointed to find two holes in the butt after only one wear during which I was sitting on soft upholstered furniture, most of the time around my house. There should not be holes in them after such gentle wear. I won't be buying from this brand ever again. If i wanted to throw money away I'm sure I'd find less disappointment if I just threw it out of my car window.	negative
Great aesthetics but very poor material and overall construction. As noted by at least one other review, the trundle will not properly fit.	negative
We love these! But... These aren't the normal size, they are larger. Not that its a problem, just want to make sure you know.	positive
Works fine. And easy to install	positive
Beautiful jacket however some people’s jackets had a beautiful floral lining and mine did not but it doesn’t take away from the beauty of the jacket. The reviews lead you to believe you need to size up for larger arms and breasts but you don’t. I am a 34DDD with muscular arms and had to return my Xl for a L and that has NEVER happened to me. I will definitely purchase in another color as well.	positive
Great for soccer games outdoor in the cold.	positive
Love these garden claws -- I have my own set and have been buying as gifts to friends and neighbors!	positive
I put it on last night and haven't dropped or mishandled my phone once yet somehow it's already got a fine crack in the glass. plus the very edges of the protector won't lie flat on the screen.	negative
Far too small. Size chart not even close to being accurate. Very disappointing.	negative
I have only used about five times. The string that adjust the umbrella broke also the whole top came apart. A rib it broke.	negative
I like this watch, it looks sharp and has great night time illumination. the automatic movement works great.	positive
This book is such a hot mess. It's so dumb, I think I'm just slightly dumber for having read it. It sucks away your IQ points it's that stupid. I feel like going to the author's house and demanding that she come over and mow my lawn to pay back my time. If you like the matchmaker series, skip this one. You'll be doing yourself a favor.	negative
Cool backpack. Zippers are a little cheap	positive
These do smell nice but they don't stick well or work to keep bugs away.	negative
The Bluetooth app kinda sucks it doesn’t have any preset colors or modes it would be nice if I could hook it up with my color changing light bar other then that the lights are ok for the price I would expect a little more	negative
Perfect for my party	positive
The cable is extremely stout, it is braided so as to resist snags or crimps (to a degree) and the tips are extremely strong and well made. I like the velcro strap as well and appreciate that for storage. It is a little pricey for a USB cable but it's definitely worth it so I'm not dealing with a broken cable when I least suspect it.	positive
This would be great if the lip/cap would stay on. But a hard cap on a silicone pouch is impossible. You squeeze and the cap fills up around the edges and pops off instantly, getting batter/icing everywhere.	negative
Had to rewrite review. Charger broke within 10 days. Furthermore, the company offers $5 gift card to anyone who writes a positive review so most of the reviews here are clearly fake.	negative
It does protect the screen but seriously hampers your ability to use your finger on the screen, especially with about 1/2 inch of the edges. If you use the pen it works perfectly but otherwise quite frustrating. I am looking for a different solution.	negative
The macro lens works only about 10% of the time, which is a big disappointment (without a case on the phone... it just isn't a functioning lens). The rest, after a couple of months of trying, were very disappointing as well, even with a very slim case on my iPhone 7. A couple of them get black edges/corners effect quite often that can't be removed no matter how carefully you place the camera (even without the case). Mostly, they're just fuzzy, even when attached without a case. Really, really not worth the purchase.	negative
The best earl grey I've ever had - its the only one i'll drink now !!	positive
Ordered chocolate milk and did not receive it and then I learn that this item is ineligible for return. My child tasted the one I received - hates it. So I am stuck with $30 worth of Milk that I didn’t order.	negative
This product came defective. I missed the return window and so now I’m even more frustrated. I had to take it to a special key store who charged me $60 to program and cut my key, only to find out that the key was defective and they were going to charge me anyway. So now I’m $100 out, when I could have just had the dealer take care of it in the first place. They told me people bring keys from Amazon all the time and they don’t work a lot of the time!	negative
Really nice fit and good material.	positive
Not made well around the toes. Little tie sticks out	negative
I got the Black on Black one and I love it! I can wear it going out or to work everyday! No gadgets just the time and date, it’s also comfortable and will get even more when the leather breaks in so far no issues!	positive
"Adhesive completely gave out within 8 days of application, just fell off phone and won't adhere now. When it was on phone the glare off of this was horrible. Phone was almost unusable in car or outside because glare obscured phone. Would not have purchased if not for the ""Amazon's Choice"", feel like Amazon should refund everyone who purchased this especially since they have since removed the ""Amazon Choice"" designation. Horrible product give us our money back."	negative
Not as good of a quality as I thought I would be getting. I put painters tape around the edges because they were sharp and already had rust. It was also dented in some places.	negative
"This particular Pop! is of lower quality, which explains why it was an ""add-on"". You can see the glue at the back of Benny's head, and the paint job on his face is less than stellar. Just goes to show, you get what you pay for. I will not be buying something as an ""add-on"" again."	negative
I swear by this stuff. I work in public as soon as I feel anything funky in my throat i use it. Especialy on airplanes where the air is questionable at best..Good size for travel.	positive
altho they are nice only 2 out the four would go over a wood. the other two I could not even get over my Hybrid. also after using for just 2 weeks one has a hole in it..the hole is not anywhere that could possibly be stressed....would not buy again..	negative
charms are bright, painted nice.	positive
I bought many times, very good products	positive
These are see through if you bend... at all. If you dont bend, they are perfect for you.	negative
Good product but some may find the accelerator cover difficult to install. Takes significant manual strength and instructions could be better.	positive
I bought this product as a birthday gift for my dad. He absolutely loved it and so did I! It's exactly as advertised.	positive
These are by far the worst plates I ever saw. Quality is horrible and the plates are poorly made not worth the money you pay.	negative
I’m sure this item would’ve been great, had I received it. They delivered it to some stranger, and let him sign for it, and keep it.	negative
A must have for pc builds and any electronic project. It also works like a datasheet with many interesting specs from different brands and dimensions	positive
I purchased this for the corner of my shower. Instructions were simple, easy to follow. I’ve had it up for a month now and it seems sturdy and doing the job. My only complaint so far, is that I ordered the shelfs with hooks and I received ones without.	positive
These headphones needed to be returned they never worked.	negative
Beautiful filled with candies for kids as a shower gift. Lol..	positive
These are great! Definitely get the strawberry ones!!!	positive
Really like the crank arm set. I did have to add more blue loctite to pinch bolts. Because they would loosen. Not a big deal, still very happy with it.	positive
Very pleased with this glitter adhesive vinyl. I needed small sheets and an assortment of colors so this was perfect for my project. It cut perfectly with my Cricut Explore air 2 (custom settings, glitter vinyl). I did a test cut 1st to ensure my settings were correct. It cut and weeded like butter and was the perfect touch for my project. Very pleased with the product and assortment of colors.	positive
Purchased in the past for my husband. They are very large and good quality.	positive
Seem like fake Huggies. I bought some from costco, was awesome diapers but these are too light, keep on leaking	negative
didnt like the way the sheets feel with it on	negative
although a pain to do this necessary step it is required	positive
The ordering process was super easy, the product shipped quickly and was received in perfect order. Even better, these snack bars are tasty, great consistency and amazing flavor. I'll eat these every day as a quick snack in between meals.	positive
Bought this product in the March and my right headlight has gone out now twice. Lights look great but for whatever reason one of the bulbs is faulty.	negative
The main feature on this system, the wireless charging dock, stopped charging after just 5 months. After doing a little research, it’s a very common complaint!!!!	negative
Came missing pieces. Incredibly flimsy. Tricky to put together the top part. Wouldn’t buy this again.	negative
Awesome that it came in a pack of 10 for $8, way cheaper than autozone or anywhere else but the only thing is that it's not as bright as I hope but it does what it need to do and I'm happy with it.	positive
Nice size for single people like me. Instructions say microwave it for 3.5 minutes. I like my rice a little more softer so after the 3.5 minutes I add more water and microwave it for another 2 minutes. I just wish they didn't cost as much as they do. One dollar per cup is a bit high.	positive
I’ve had these less then three months and they have all stopped working and will not charge my iPhone.	negative
Too big for my face.	negative
We love it! Works perfectly. Good coverage	positive
Giving two stars ONLY because it is working. Item is used...looks to have been dropped as it has three small chunks/scrapes on it and had finger print smudges on it. Box was sealed and item looked “new in box.” I’ve noticed I’m by far not the first to complain about being sold a used product by this seller.	negative
Did not work once it was in the water . the pouch camp opening up letting water in thank God my phone is waterproof	negative
I like this phone holder very much. Does exactly what I expected. It is not bulky. Pretty shade of purple.	positive
"Nothing special to see here, not the best cheapo earbuds but certainly not the worst. Comfy and stay in well enough for the treadmill. Only ""complaint"" would be the small bit of plastic covering the openings to the drivers. I'm sure it was there to help protect the longevity of the product but it significantly dulls the sound of the earbuds so I removed them."	positive
I've owned/tried much more expensive mats and haven't found on that performs any better than this one and it is truly easy to clean!! There are so many out there today and its hard to filter through all of them or to truly know which is better but I will say this one was a great buy for the money.	positive
Had to buy another because I didn't clip it to my BCD and watched it sink 100+ feet into the abyss during my safety stop. These are good to have on you at all times, never know when or for what purpose it will be handy.	positive
Not only did I find this story exceptionally well written, but thoroughly engaging. I am admittedly more of a sword and sorcery kind of guy and while this tale was more sorcery and less sword I nevertheless found myself eager to pick it up again each evening before bed. The story built up through action and adventure, heartbreak and triumph, and betrayal and discovery. Thoroughly enjoyed this story.	positive
GOOD FOR FURNITURE WITH WIDE WOOD SLATS BETWEEN DRAWERS AND KITCHEN DRAWERS. DONT REQUIRE YOU TO MANUALLY PUSH DOWN ON TO CLOSE DRAWER LIKE THE SPRING LOADED ONES DO.	positive
They look very much like the vintage barrettes, but the clip is so thin and flimsy. I doubt they'll last long. The colors are not great.	negative
THIS IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY 100% SHIT PRODUCT MY GLOCK 23 DOESNT FIT AT ALL ITS A PIECE OF SHIT....	negative
We purchased the sunglasses straps for a vacation in Peru. They have already fallen apart, won’t stay on earpieces and the neoprene has separated from the fabric.	negative
Had problems with the wifi & had to return it.	positive
The color on the description says beige, but it is white. Very thin and cheaply made, wouldn't recommend.	negative
I have been using this for years but this was the first time I ordered from Amazon. I did not compare the correct size so I will not buy again it is cheaper in the grocery store. BUT, overall I love this stuff. The natural ingredients are something I look for and this taste better than others.	positive
Description states low cut but med cut was sent. Fit is good but wanted low cut type.	negative
Looks great but the only problem was the tape that was applied onto it already. It was set too low and it would be exposed when I installed the visors. So then I had to take the tape off and reapply a new one on each visor. Other than that it’s been serving its purpose.	positive
i bought 2 of these and both were failures, jusy bubbled out a mess, too late to return them i guess	negative
The bands are great!! I use them at home on days I don't have time to go to the gym for a quick half hour work out. I was nervous at first as they seem like they'd snap easily but I haven't had any issues so far and I've had them for a few months. Great price and value if you are looking for something try something new with your at home workouts.	positive
The tablet was good, but the peg where you plug in the cord has broke off. I have lost approx $300	negative
i had some small scratches on my car for a while and they were keep bugging me but i didnt want to paint it because a partial paint is visible even with identical color and doing a full job was just crazy so i decided to give a try to this paint scratch cloth and surprisingly it did a very good job. now i`m the only one who knows where the scratches were	positive
I love the book because it shows that the abuse can affect everyone not just the person it happened to thank you for doing this book	positive
It works perfectly. All you have to do is follow the simple instructions, and you will get very accurate measurements. Easy to use on yourself without anyone help you.This product is well made, accurate and, best of all, reasonably priced.	positive
If you want to give this as an indoor toy for your dog, forget it. I had it for one day and had to throw it away already. I found in my house little pieces of plastic of the bone everywhere. So first of all, it’s not good because the dog can swallow these little pieces. And second, it’s super messy. Too bad.	negative
After reading the cookbook I am grateful for some of the designations provided by the editor. Certain recipes are indicated as light or fast to prepare. I do not want this, so I turned to this book. Thanks to the book, I learned how to balance myself pH, through which I can lose weight, fight fatigue, improve digestion and increase energy. The book is written very easily and understandably. Thanks to the author for the useful information.	positive
The colors matched my daughters wedding shower perfectly!!	positive
Morning preparations for work	positive
Way too expensive for what they are.	negative
Just ok. I have already had to replace them. I am not sure if we are too hard on cords but these only last about 2 months.	positive
Would not connect to router. No phone number or contact fr technical support.i returned the extender	negative
My husband likes them but they are huge and he already has big hands!	positive
These replacements are shorter than the original wands that came with the toy. My cats find the replacement to be uninteresting because of that -- they had the good stuff and now this replacement wand isn't nearly as good. Also, the part that screws on to the toy is shorter, so it doesn't fit snugly and falls off easily.	negative
Poor fit and poor design. Only provides more pain rather than stability.	negative
Good looking piece - a bit on the thinner side though.	positive
They are ok, not the best , but work fine	positive
well made looks great	positive
Too dark to view phone screen in daylight even with brightness setting on full. Great if you don’t plan to use phone outside during the day	negative
Look great and work perfectly. Only issue is, I ordered 2 sets of 10 lights (pink). The lights that came together in the same box were the same color, the 2nd set was a slightly different pink. Overall, not too noticeable, but they were slightly different pinks.	positive
very good kit , not a fan of the acrylic tapers. this kit also jumps sizes but besides that, its perfect.	positive
The pump handle broke off after one single use. Do not buy this.	negative
I had a pair like this for a year that were very comfortable, needed no working in. Unfortunately my puppy chewed them. So I got these to replace them. A bit tight in toe area. But otherwise fine.	positive
They cancelled the order on me so I never got them :(	negative
Way too small. And they are cut so low in the front my lady parts practically hang out.	negative
I bought this 5 months ago and it has been a great wifi camera.	positive
It doesn’t work at all	negative
Jars arrived on time and started using them to make diffusers, Candles and with Aroma Beads.	positive
I bought two of these for my sons after recent hurricanes in NC. The part where you install the batteries broke as soon as my son tried to install the batteries. I am very disappointed as I remember Coleman lanterns from my sons’ Boy Scout camping days.	negative
Beautiful knife but I CANNOT figure out how to close it?? If anyone can help please let me know	negative
My dogs seem to like them!	positive
Best for nail hardening and growth	positive
Item was exactly as described!	positive
I’m afraid this item really doesn’t live up to its promises. It’s awkward to use because it really only works in one direction. Also I’ve been unsuccessful in using this to comb through my cats’ matted hair. Waste of money.	negative
Cute for now but I know these rhinestones will pop out soon making it less cute. Not functional for a loop stand in Portrait mode only for Landscape mode. It keeps falling down in Portrait mode. The loop is not as practical as my previous case’s was and definitely not for fat fingers as it’s fairly small. Case has this weird flim on it so that it is almost powdery to the touch. Not pleasant maybe it will wear or wash off.	negative
Bought this for my dads birthday made cheap and not worth it	negative
tips over pretty easily and will constantly get tangled if the cord becomes loose in the spool.	negative
I washed them and they gave me the worst rash between my cheeks and on my bikini line. Awful material, cheap. They also smell like baby powder. Who wants to smell like a baby on their period?	negative
Item is not all stainless steel although the bowl was. I felt the description was misleading. I needed to use this so I elected not to return.	negative
Very stylish and offers good protection for my phone. Love the color as well.	positive
I have been using this pot everyday for about a month now to steam baby food and veggies. It has been very durable so far. Seems like good quality as well.	positive
Why does this seller send product this way? This is not good!	negative
So I ordered to use as a compression sleeve to help with strained ligaments...it’s my fault that I overlooked the fact these are padded for plantar fasciitis. The padding gave me a smidge of foot pain but I’m a weak shrimp in my joints so any change causes pain. This is what it is advertised to be but if you have sensitive joints it may cause some discomfort.	positive
These were barely strong enough to hold my grass clippings. Definitely not strong.	negative
After one month it will no longer hold water	negative
Good water bottle. But dropped it once and now the lid leaks .	negative
Unfortunately, this item failed. Purchased on September 4, died on 11/10. What else is there to say? Well, when the company heard I had this issue they immediately contacted me to offer help. They offered to replace the unit without discussion. I had already replaced the unit so I asked for a refund and they complied without hesitation. This is a classy outfit!	negative
We camp a lot but I still need my hair straightener! We don't have a lot storage and figured I would give this a try. I have thick, wavy hair that gets wild bed head. It does a great job and was surprised how nice it glides through my hair. It doesn't burn the ends with the one heat setting. It is light weight and comes with it's own storage bag. Don't let the cuteness fool you. It gets the job done.	positive
Item came broken and smashed.	negative
Poor quality. Stitching came apart within the week.	negative
Fits just like my old original one. Awesome	positive
i like the kit and it worked well but I thought it was a little over priced.	positive
None have germinated at this point in time	negative
Vegetable bags , great quality...	positive
I think the picture speaks for itself! These gauges are so insanely pretty in the sunlight! I received a ton of compliments the first few days I wore them! However, one slipped out and I’m unable to find it! I plan on ordering another pair when I get paid!	positive
This watch has not worked properly and now is not running at all. Very disappointed.	negative
My dog won’t go near these and he is NOT a picky eater / chewer	negative
Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!).	positive
I had to go through four converter boxes to find two that worked, but my original VCR didn't work with them.	positive
Best toaster ever...and I like toast, English muffins and bagels. Never burns up your food. Has a reheat feature and other useful settings. Get your day started off right...just add coffee.	positive
The edge guard is too hard to attach the car door. It smells bad.	negative
Fit was good real nice for the price!	positive
not worth the price....its just a fan and even with water in it the air wasnt cooler than without.	negative
I bought this for my 1 year old son who loves dinosaurs. We are using this as his diaper bag and it is just big enough for 6 diapers and a pack pamper wipes. I love this we ordered the toddler and the straps are adjustable! great buy.	positive
I bought this for my daughter who is turning 1. I want to do pictures in our mini studio. It fits her perfect. It also fits our 3 year old too. She even loves putting it on the dog to wear. It comes with 1-5 so you can use it year after year or you can use it for many children. I love the pink and it is well made and seems like it will last.	positive
Great product and worth the buy	positive
Buttons crack on inside of cover and slip off when buttons when trying to use them after a little while	negative
Wimpy sound. Other drivers laugh when they hear it! Been using these for 9-10 months now so the plus is that they're still working.	negative
I have not received it!!	negative
"Almost every can was BADLY DENTED. 7 out of 12 cans were smushed, while 2 more were only in the ""reduced price"" condition. 75% UNUSABLE...Ridiculous!"	negative
The controller lasted a couple of days and broke by itself while I was playing GTA 5 and no longer works Also the battery is complete crap and I only get two hours of use out of it	negative
Excellent Product and prompt delivery! Recommend.	positive
Very poorly produced product. Great Idea as a gift but the product quality is very poor. Don’t buy it.	negative
I like the concept but I’m done using these. The bottle is much more stable. You can’t really move around while pumping with these bags. Also, as other buyers have mentioned, once you open it to use the milk in the bag, and you only need portion of the milk, the milk in the bag leaks everywhere.	negative
"I kept reading reviews that said size up. I am 5'3"" / 105lbs / small chest. I ordered medium, scared it would be too big. It was perfect."	positive
Bought this product a couple weeks ago and it's already starting to clump. Beware because it's a waste of money if it starts to clump!!!!	negative
great price. perfect as favor	positive
I was really looking forward to growing Stinging Nettles, after I had read about how wonderful of a food source it is but after 3 different plantings I've had nothing come up.	negative
Doesn't blow me away but works good for me	positive
Comprehensive book but too small for your learners	positive
These got the job done with no fuss. Removing them to use the stove requires reasonable strength. Best used for homes with toddlers and the very elderly. Once you see someone remove one it is easily figured out.	positive
Love these! They really add to my workout and challenge new muscles.	positive
After a period of time the putty began to smell nasty	negative
Feels great to the touch, great value for 3 just in case but I was able to install the first go. There wasn't any info on the reviews on this, but it's VERY fingerprint resistant! That's a characteristic that's worthy of 5 stars all on it's own. 😁	positive
This was a great read. Hard to put down. Quick-paced story with many twists and turns. I would highly recommend this book. It's not my normal choice of reading material plot-wise but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Do yourself a favor, and don't miss this exciting read!	positive
We like the cars but just wish the batteries lasted longer. 8 to 10 min tops. Do recommend buying extra batteries	positive
The handle is extremely hot as is the cover which you have to take off to pour. Ridiculous. Not only did I burn my finger taking off the cover but the heat warped it. Very unhappy with the features.	negative
Says delivered by Amazon. It was not. I as here at the alleged time. Also, I have searched high and low and there are no options to file a claim or contact the seller. While it will be hard to stop completely, I will be slowing down my ordering from amazon.	negative
I use this pencil to fill in skimpy areas in the brow or cover whites or extend the brow. It blends in well with my eyebrows and is the right shade for me.	positive
Very cheap quality plastic just buy the brand name case for more durability	negative
Thought it would have more of an orange flavor, thus 4 stars. Tastes more grapefruit like. Was impressed with how I felt the day after a heavy workout. I was not as sore and tired like I normally would be. BCAA was the only new item I added so it had to be that.	positive
Front leg, part A, wood was split third of leg. The other stool is perfect. Unable to get just a replacement leg. Need to return entire product.	negative
I have used this in the past and it was always thick. This time it’s very thin, like it was already watered down. Did they change the formula or was my bottle tampered with?	negative
I like this case. It stays open and I can pick it up without everything flopping over like my last one which broke my former iPad when it flipped sending everything to the floor. This one appears to be sturdy, is lightweight and fairly easy to type on except for the placement of the right hand shift key. Its nice to be able to choose a color that matches my device too!	positive
These are great! Addition to the Wooden sign.	positive
Inferior quality and rather medium than large size	negative
So much better than foscam and so easy to set up! Will slowly be making the switch! Love the wide angle	positive
Nice color, but the case doesn't stay on at all. Even opening my Mac makes the top case fall off. I got the exact size case for my Mac's serial number so only buy this case if you want to sit and stare at the nice color of the case but never open and close your laptop	negative
It works well as a deodorant however, after a few uses I noticed that it made my underarms peel and itch.	negative
Perhaps I was expecting too much. These were disappointing. Does not cool or last as long as ice.	negative
I'm very unhappy so far. They don't mulch good at all. Yesterday I was trying to cut about 1 inch of dry grass and all it was doing was dumping clumps of grass every where. My push Toro mulcher was working good. I ended up using Toro to clean up my John Deere's mess.	negative
They are good and easy to use	positive
This is a joke and a waste of money	negative
I was really looking forward to this dress . The material is very cheap. Was very disappointed with this product sent to back	negative
If there is a definitive book for Python, this is it. Written in a technical manner without being too dry and academic.	positive
These were exactly what was expected and were a great alternative to buying text books. The process to buy and return was easy.	positive
It breaks quickly and amazon does not make it right by refunds or sending a replacement.	negative
despite indicating this fit my vehicle it was simply to small to connect to the wiper arm....	negative
we have very spoiled dog. they eat this canned food on top of natures recipe dry easy digest. my pitty bull has IBS and is able to eat this with no problems. They score well on their Vet visits, their coats are shiny, eyes are clear, and blood values are good whenever they are done. I can't think of any down side to this food.	positive
We'll never return to medical supply stores. Here we have identical products at a reasonable price.	positive
They fit perfectly but were stained prior to arriving at my home. I loved the fit but as soon as I looked at them in the mirror I noticed multiple dark stains down one of the pant legs	negative
These are very light weight tips, and the diamond surface becomes dull after one use.	negative
Tested on mole on leg and took about 2 weeks for scab to come off.	negative
I ordered the 20 pound tank and received a 5 pound tank, was trying to get before camping trip now have to use what came. Not happy at all with order service.	negative
the look of it is great but unfortunately after we install it and use it when you switch it from shower to normal tap it doesn't switch easily and lately it just working as a shower and can't be switch to regular tap ..which it wet all my cloth whenever I use it	negative
I’m surprised at the quality! Based on some reviews I expected it to be much thinner and cheap feeling. It’s definitely worth the money.	positive
Bought as a christmas gift. Appears to be a good product.	positive
I love these chokers normally, most of my jewelry is from this company. I have this necklace in silver and I wear it almost every day to work. I received the gold one this morning, put it on and it immediately broke in my hands. So sad because I was looking forward to having it in gold as well.	negative
The bottle arrived shattered	negative
its not working as expected	negative
They work and look great at first. After a while the sensor begins to fail so they never shut off during the day and don't give the full light at night.	negative
This little sweetie packs a lot of battery life into a small and elegant package. My only issue is that it needs about 8-10 hours to fully charge when it's been nearly totally discharged.	positive
The shoelaces are not too hard to install and they are good looking. However, one of the end clips on my laces seems to be defective and keeps popping off. It has been over 30 days since the purchase, I can’t return them. If you buy them, make sure the clips close evenly and completely.	negative
Was suppose to receive this phone case on Saturday and still has not been delivered. Really disappointed in the fact that I have the option to track package but has never been updated. Will never buy from them again.	negative
Seems to be overpriced for a bland tasting olive oil. It is suppose to be organic, but the flavor is lacking for a fresh pressed olive oil.	positive
I was very surprised when I received this. I didn't think it would work but I love love it. It took a few tried to really get the flow right but once I did you just press it on and then use the little brush that comes with it to smooth it out. The only bad thing is the shadow did break really easy. I have to open it really slow or it will spill out. I will order again because it really does work well.	positive
Works like a nail brush should.	positive
I sweat a lot and this glue didn't keep the lace down on the unit, so it was not a good product for me.	negative
I like that the product is organic and free from common toxins. I don't like the plastic packaging and applicator--I would love it if these were replaced with something biodegradable. The product works well, but is not best for me for heavy exercise where I still use Tampax or Playtex Sport to avoid leaks.	positive
once I've actually slept on it in our camper, I'll have a better idea. but laying on it tells me I'm probably gonna sleep like a baby	positive
the product seemed like it would sit flat against the wall. Unfortunately the photos failed to show that a large protruding round structure is at the back of the unit. Therefore the unit has to sit at least 6 inches from the wall. There are no returns available on this product. Hamilton Beach customer support were extremely rude and make me never want to purchase a product from them again.	negative
I don't like this, can't even part it, it's ugly and the hair tangles almost immediately!	negative
After replacing the new one, the air in my car become so much better. The only thing I don't like it the air flow is not as strong as I install before.	positive
At first glance out of the box, it seemed perfect. Once placed outside in the sun, I quickly changed my mind. I was disappointed in the quality of the flag. I could see through the fabric and the image on the other side could be seen. I ended up returning it.	negative
Do NOT WASTE your MONEY! These DO NOT WRITE !!! Yet alone glide like they are supposed to do!!! Absolute junk! I’m actually wondering if his company selling some type of knock off . These are the worst pens I’ve EVER tried to write with. And here’s the best part.... They DO NOT accept returns !! Lol! Imagine that. What a surprise. If I were Amazon I wouldn’t even allow them to advertise and sell on this website it’s not fair to the people that trust Amazon products.	negative
Product came with the plastic case undone. There were also areas of the handle that look like they have been used as well making me believe I was sent someone else's return. Company's quality control needs to be better. Amazon customer service was great in helping me return this item.	negative
Essential for the Nexstar 130. Temperature and handling put the adjustment out. This is well made, good fit and finish, sharp laser, simple to use.	positive
Too small I actually thought they were a bit bigger	negative
I wish the bag had a little more padding to protect the light table but other than that everything seems to be in good order and I wish it came with a wall adapter it only comes with the cord	positive
Disappointed in the filling, it was a granular texture and tasted like a sugary chocolate icing.	negative
Great fit in my hand and easy use of switching the safety lever to use. Unfortunately, there was no stream. It was more like a puff of short mist and I had to use both hands to squeeze down on the pump for that to even come out. How would one be quick to use in the event of an attack? No thanks.	negative
Very comfortable, looks nice, and is true to size. The material is a cheap silky nylon. I thought it would be more cotton like ...but I still like it.	positive
At first I thought 'where is this going'? Seven pieces of the moon? Twists lead to understanding and time leads to a story I'm glad I stuck with. That's all so I don't give it away.	positive
This washer works great. but it's small. We are two people, we cook everday from scratch. so you still have wash big pots{they take to much room). You can't jam pack washer, so it's takes some practice to maxium amount of dishes done. It does work great	positive
Doesn’t come with all the listed attachments.	negative
The Cheetos taste fine. My kids like the puffs better than the regular Cheetos. But instead of 104 packs stated in the description, I only got 88 packs in the box. Expire Dec 05 when they shipped them out at Nov 21.	negative
Outstanding product and easy to install. Very bright white light, a great look for my car.	positive
The zip line was broken right out of the box and the whole thing felt so flimsy. My son was really disappointed that he bought this with his allowance money. Good lesson learned for him, but was even worse quality that I was prepared for. Definitely don’t waste your money on this.	negative
This one is way to watery and doesnt last long i noticed different ingredients in the 32oz compared to the 8oz bottle . Dissapointing	negative
Use it for long drives/camping, cheap and does the job.	positive
These work great. I prefer the daylight instead of the dingy yellow lights we had previously. These have brightened up the house and I’ve added more to the cart to replace all of this style throughout our house.	positive
Very stylish set. Giving it as a gift.	positive
Clean design. Low noise. Performs as expected. Love the night light	positive
I cannot believe how much pet stores charge for these cat collars! I got this set and they are even nicer than the pet store ones! Highly recommend.	positive
The product didn’t perform like the description said it	negative
I got wrong color. I was looking for auburn but my color is almost black. I used this henna. I added tea and lemon to the mixture and hold it for 4 hours. My hair is almost black and not auburn as advertised. My natural color is brown. Not sure if it advertised correctly.	negative
It was advertised that Elsa would speak 15 phases. Not true . She only says one phase. Very disappointed for the price. Don't waste your money. Its junk !!!	negative
Very disappointed, review in WSJ was very missleading.. too many negatives to go into for a quick review... the author has a spin on the 50s and 60s Russia vs US that is very off putting.. as if he never really lived through the time period for the average person.	negative
Product was fine, but not a single person in the family liked the taste	positive
I was unable to find a way for my HP printer to accept these cartridges. After 3 evenings and about 5 hours of research, I counted my time and money as a loss. I will be attempting to return this item.	negative
This is the guide only. Not as pictured! No clamp or drill bit.	negative
It is always with great pleasure that a Michael Connelly book is introduced. Bosch never disappoints. Can’t wait for the next installment.	positive
New to purchase again - Requesting express shipping (vs. ground)	negative
Ive only had my Amazon Fire less than 5 months and the battery is dead and because I didn't buy a warranty I'm out of luck	negative
I've been doing Keto for about a month now and stumbled upon the Carb Killa products and love them all! This spread is awesome, tastes just like Nutella, no odd after tastes whatsoever, perfect on a piece of low-carb bread or just to eat straight from the container. Will definitely buy again!	positive
This screen protector does NOT fit well. Bubble on the corner. Its ok, its until the good review one comes out. At least I would not hesitate to toss it away.	negative
Really big and not as bright as others	positive
I found this book interesting. Young adults and older would enjoy this book. It does have sexual content and some cursing. A real folklore and fantasy.	positive
1 didn't work, but rest are good, the plastic spikes bend very easily when pushed in the ground so don;t push all the way in til you are sure of placement.	positive
My main issue with this set is that the tunnels themselves have sharp backs, which makes pushing them through when going up in size painful. I've decided that I won't be using these to get to the size I want.	negative
Bought this thermometer to track my cycle, but it’s not backlit and doesn’t have the recall feature. So it’s not very convenient for a dark room. I have to take my temp, then turn my phones brightness waay up, check the temp, and record it in my app. It does seem accurate to me, but I’ll be purchasing one that syncs via bluetooth to my phone.	negative
I bought this bed 10 days ago and now it’s $70 cheaper. I would like a price adjustment.	negative
This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise. It is small and lightweight making it easy to move from room to room when necessary. We are happy with our purchase.	positive
I liked it, only had enough room for small earrings and rings.	negative
nice and confortable!	positive
The quality of the tools is not good!	negative
Like how it fits the phone snug! Light and easy to use.	positive
They look great, but I should have probably gotten a half size smaller. Additionally, are these supposed to come with insoles? Because mine didn't.. and they're quite uncomfortable. Pro: They look good. Cons: Very uncomfortable, they don't come with insoles.	negative
I wasn’t expecting much for the price- but really like these! They are the typical cloth pop-up box material- so they aren’t super sturdy but hold up just fine. I do wish I would have gotten another color because I’m thinking the white will get dirty quickly- but didn’t think about that at the time of ordering.	positive
My wife was pretty satisfy with this squeegee. We have a lot of windows and glasses in our house. She was tired of cleaning the glasses with paper towel and realize how much towels she use during every cleaning. So we decided to give this a try. Not only does it make her cleaning a lot easier and faster, but it also save us a lot of money on paper towel. The metal material make it really really durable.	positive
I was looking for a good PH meter. Then saw this one that would do Light, Moisture and PH. Moisture was good, Light fair and PH not good.	negative
I am beyond disappointed. This was suppose to be a birthday present for my Fiance. I opened the box only to find a bucket with an exploded bottle of yellow wax .. a yellow sponge and that is it. It is literally missing most of the kit.. and what IS in there is BROKEN. I hope Amazon is able to somehow fix this disappointment.	negative
This is a great product. It took about 5 minutes to install. I can't believe people had any difficulty installing it. Piece of cake and looks good.	positive
Did not receive product	negative
Bought a new fan for a new build, which was sold by Noctua Cooling Solutions and fulfilled by Amazon LLC, received a used one instead with missing some of the mounting hardware and scuff marks and someone else's hair from previous installation. When in operation, It was vibrating more than I can accept for a $30 fan. Now I have to waste my time returning the product back to Amazon and look for a new one. Unacceptable service for a premium price, just great!	negative
It make taking my dogs on walk much easier	positive
These are awesome - comfy, warm, and love the pine green. My only issue is there wasn’t stuffing inside the boot shaft or dividers in the box, so my boots arrived creased from the way they laid overlapped the box. Doesn’t affect functionality, but I can see the creases when the boots are on. Hopefully the creases will go away with time. Still happy with the purchase.	positive
Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module	negative
best stuff for foot pain. It helped me get through 1/2 marathon training	positive
The product has leaked at both nozzle ends since receipt. I would not recommend this product!	negative
Thin material not great quality but it was cheap	negative
Just not powerful enough to blow out coat. I returned it	negative
Fast and accurate. Works great on bread, meat, and candy making. Great little tool for the price.	positive
We replaced both nozzles; one is barely spurting out enough washer fluid to reach the windshield. The other doesn't work at all.	negative
handle fell apart after about 4 uses i loved it till it broke. cheaply made	negative
The powder was not very sour.	negative
Out of the box, one of the two walkie talkies did not work with fresh batteries. It appears as though the speaker on it is malfunctioning - it did not make any tones when turning on or off. It seems to suggest it should be making noise, but no noise comes out. Volume is at maximum. Changed channels, looked at the instructions, etc. No luck. Can't recommend!	negative
I’ve used others that did a good job. These tend to streak and smear. Not very satisfied. But if you don’t mind wiping off with a glass cleaning cloth after using, it will remove most bug stains.	negative
Cheaply made, too thin, does not look as advertised!	negative
"I'm 5'8"" 41 bust, neck is too large so slides off shoulders, only 1 inch overlap in front, soft material though. I'm going to try to add a black collar all the way around front to see if it'll stay on my shoulders"	negative
Smaller than would be expected for a medium	negative
never arrived; had to get a refund	negative
Looked great with my dress. Appropriate length. Does not wrinkle easily.	positive
Harder than I expected but better than I thought it would be.	positive
I expected this to be metal but it was just flimsy plastic...still perfect for what I want it for.....just don't expect heavy duty.	positive
I bought these for my 4.6 lb dog, they were too small for him.	negative
My replacement remote is an exact replica of the original which I had lost. It works perfectly and has the same functionality. I highly recommend this product.	positive
This is made from corn	negative
We used to receive these at Christmas from family friends, and I missed having them. They were as good as I remember them being. My only complaint is the boxes are much smaller than they used to be, and so it's a bit pricey.	positive
One pair of scissors isn’t as sharp as it should be for being a brand new pair of scissors	negative
The blanket is lovely! Very happy.	positive
This review is for Chosen Blood. I love reading about Demons & Angels. I love this world and the characters in it. This is a different world with action, potential romance, and enough twists & turns to keep you invested in this story. I received an ARC from the author and I am leaving this Honest review because I choose to. I loved this story enough to get the boxed set. On to the next story.	positive
It is falling apart and is made cheaply.	negative
A bit dull....but sharpened up beautifully. Very good deal!	positive
When “they” arrived there was only one box with one in it but the sticker on the box placed over the upc stated 3 piece. I called and the gentleman told me to keep that one and they would send the right products. Showed up again the same exact way. Service rep 2 could not ship me another “one” to correct the issue but refunded a third of the original price. I really hope this issue with the mislabeling gets corrected	negative
Love them. I have bought many Zum products over the years. These were just as expected. Clean, invigorating fragrance. Great gifts!	positive
Do not buy this product, works decent enough but the software is terrible, there is no customer support, and if you forget your password, they are basically useless. There are many better options on the market.	negative
Dimmer went out after a couple weeks, seems to be common. At first the light would start to dim on its own, then you could reset the level by turning it off then back on. After another week of use it’s been getting worse. At this point I’m more worried about a fire hazard from the dimmer switch, time for another try and willing to spend more.	negative
Very nice, good quality. A little heavy for using just for a .skimmer	positive
hard to use, paint will not flow smoothly	negative
The cover flap is not magnetic therefore the cover will easily fall open because there is no strap to keep it closed is not magnetic.	negative
It’s relatively small. I wasn’t expecting some huge grinder or anything, but I was still a little disappointed when I saw how small it was. I always like to store a little extra inside but instead I found myself grinding a lot. But for someone whose looking for a first grinder or something, this will definitely work. It’s a little difficult to clean, but again, no big deal. Overall it’s a good project.	positive
Works well and is compatible with the Alexa app. No problems controlling through both my 2nd and 3rd generation Echo Dots.	positive
Brought this for my boyfriends car. I was actually expecting it to be less sturdy but to my surprise it seemed to be a great quality and the red seems brighter than what I was expected. Cant wait to see what it looks like on his car	positive
The nightgown was very comfortable to sleep in, but fell apart after a couple of washes!	positive
Everyone shoul have one. My overall mouth health has increased dramatically according to my dentist.	positive
Haven't had time to put up. But great price.	positive
A good love story that keeps u intrigued to the end. Couple struggling to keep there relationship together and how there friends was there to help them through it. U don’t know how much your relationship can effect your friends until u go through something like this. The ending still has me wondering if they worked it out. Might have to be a part ll lol. The two main actors carried the film well	positive
Had a bad smell that lingered for several weeks.	negative
Worked for a month then nothing. Computer crashes and restarts all of the time. Says battery is at 0 when it have been plugged in overnight. Have reset SMC many times, still nothing. Very inconsistent. Never had any issues before.	negative
Easy to order the right filter.	positive
One of my shopping lists is door bell. Because I love shopping online so I want my packages is secure delivery front my door! This door bell comes with video feature you can know who is push your bell! Also safety first when you have kids at house! The door bell is very easy to setup and it came with screws and tell you how to install it! Nice product!	positive
Small portion. Big price	negative
My two year old granddaughter LOVES this! It’s colorful and gives her lots of hours of fun!	positive
By day 2 the pillow would no longer stay inflated. Ended up using a hoodie for a pillow.	negative
I bought these socks for Mom to use indoors not outdoors so they will last. The socks did fit except the top where the sock fit around the ankle is very tight and I had to cut away some of it to fit comfortably since Mom's ankles swell; regular socks are also too tight if they are not larger. I recommend these socks to anyone who has normal ankles without edema because of the tight fit at the top.	positive
Fits fine but the whistling noise it makes when you drink is a nuisance. Not a big deal as long as you don't mind people looking at you when you take a drink.	negative
A LITTLE BIGGER THAN MY ORIGINAL, BUT WORKS GREAT	positive
Fits all types of phone. We use android and an iPhone 7Plus in it. Never slides on our bike rides.	positive
Okay these things stink. As in smell bad enough to gag you if you're npt ready for it. However many selenium caps do so it's not surprising. I want those who don't know better to be forewarned. Otherwise it works exactly as I expected and my most recent lab work shows it.	positive
Love this fan. We have two	positive
not bad for the money i gave 4 stars because the wands needed to be giggled for a bit to get them to start charging and if you bumped one while trying to get the other charged then i would have to carefully fix and not bump again.	positive
This piano have different sound and plays a nice volume.	positive
it did not seem to put out much light in the direction of the plant, most of the light went out in a horizonal direction.	negative
It’s a nice mask. I wear a 7 1/2 new era hat. And this mask hardly fits me. It’s snug but that’s they way it should be. This is the 2nd one I bought now. The Velcro ripped off of my first because of my big head	positive
Have used it twice, both with excellent results on suppressor baffles. As mentioned by others it shortens the time if you add hot water immediately. Easy to clean up and store	positive
Gift for 4 year old... she loves them and wears them every day!	positive
Good quality and fit. No issues	positive
I am sure these batteries are fine but my package only contained 8 of them. Because of the application they are intended for I have to buy more before I can proceed.	negative
"So incredibly easy to install and to hang curtains. I bought the wrong curtains for the thin rod; but that's okay, new curtains with the 1"" pocket will work best for 'black out' curtains."	positive
This unit is difficult to handle when checking a button battery, and it does not give meaningful power readings. I tested several new, out of the box, hearing aid button batteries, and each tested less than 1/2 of the factory specs. I went to the hearing aid center, who checked the same batteries, and they all tested the correct 1.5 factory ratings. The AA and AAA ran about the same variance.	negative
Outfit is adorable! The headband was very big for my dog’s little head but the rest fit to size. The material is felt n soft she did not fuss at all in it. Definitely recommend. Got lots of laughs!	positive
This is my first time to feel the foot mask, it's amazing. At the beginning, I didnt know if I can take 60-90 mins base on the instruction, so I watched the tv and played with my cell phone. When I take it off from my feet, I can see the dead skin on my feet, after I use warm water to wash it, they are gone, and my feet feel very comfortable, smooth and soft, just like foot massage.	positive
Stays closed and opens easily.	positive
My favorite. Great for travelling.	positive
This set was great. It kept the grandkids busy for a couple of hours!	positive
don't waste your money. The clamp is so cheaply made that it is essentially unusable.	negative
This is not plug and play. It flashes. Would return but Amazon won't let me.	negative
I really didn’t like this hair. It was very itchy and would not get straight. I did cowash first which is something I normally do. This just wasn’t the hair for me	negative
This plant was very stressed-poor root system-presently coaxing back to health- mild success see new leaf shoots Trying to stay positive!	negative
Are those real bluetooth ? I just received one and I have to plug in to my phone in order to connect bluetooth. if it has bluetooth connection, why I have to plug it in to my phone all the time to stay connect? If I have to plug it in to my phone, what is different from regular earphone? As there is no Q & A to ask a question to the seller, i have to put a equation here. To Seller: can you response my question ASAP?	negative
Like the leather and the fit but I ordered for right side use not the left side. Problem not solved yet!!!!!	negative
DISAPOINTED! the grinder is very hard to turn. It does put out a good amount of pepper.	negative
Worked well with thawed fruit.	negative
The color I received was not the color I ordered and there are no returns. I would give 0 stars if that were an option.	negative
I did not buy or receive this item	negative
I am pleased with my purchase so far. Cord length and sturdiness meet my expectations. Time will tell as for durability.	positive
Somehow moths infested package. I threw away but forgot to take pictures! no refund:(	negative
8 out of 10 pods seem to just blow apart inside and fill your cup with coffee grounds. I then have to clean the Keurig and try again. I won't be purchasing this again and I don't recommend the brand.	negative
Handle was bent over when it arrived due to how it was shipped. Base of item is cardboard, so may not be very durable. I hoped to put the OXO wipes dispenser in one side (it fits) but I could see that it would weigh down that side and bend the cardboard more. Returned.	negative
product very weak! I weigh 230lbs. When I set on one of these cusions it immediatly goes flat so I tried 2 and then all 3. Finally it was somewhat comfortable. I purchased these to share with family but that won't happen...lol If I had paid any more for them I would return but I will just call it a learning experience.	negative
These things smell like shite every time I wear them; never had shoes do that. The wife is making me send them back as she says it is this cheap crap made in China by gooks.	negative
These are super good.	positive
So simple to install. Delivery of item was quick.	positive
"These are not versatile for anything, tried fitting a lid and took over a dozen times. I have a 6"" glass bowl and the kids were either too tiny or too big. They do not stick to glass bowls well either."	negative
DVD Disc is unplayable	negative
Easy to understand and use.	positive
Did not fit my 2012 Chevy malibu, useless need a size up	negative
Great product for the first 3 weeks - then .... the strap breaks. Gutted.	negative
I ordered the color of dress that was blues and I got a dress that has reds in it. Not happy	negative
I like how soft and velvety these are, the material feels nice. I’m 5’2” about 122 lbs and the small size was a bit baggy on me and a little long. I had to pull them pretty far up but under a dress they worked pretty well.	positive
nice looking and they tuck down in my shoes but they are a bit large.	positive
They don't send your stuff....it has been 4 months since my order was placed.	negative
Love this case. I have went thru at least 3 other cases but just wasn't what I wanted.	positive
Camera won't read them: totally useless, never worked	negative
In the past I’ve had nothing but luck with Christmas cacti. This one seemed healthy when I received it, but after having it for a little over a week it already has died (I think) and all of its leaves and everything has fallen off. I really wanted to like this, but I guess it’s just the luck of the draw with plants. You never know how well they’re going to do	negative
Similar to other mineral sunscreens I've used, but tends to separate in the bottle and comes out with some oily liquid despite shaking well. Otherwise works well, not overly thick and is easy enough to rub in on babies skin. Gave good coverage for a full day in the sun without reapplying.	positive
This was the perfect thing for our Friday night football games. Great combination of cozy while being water resistant. Didn't realize that it actually turns into a warm poncho till we took it out of the bag... This would also be a great idea for kids in band.	positive
"Nice heave 14"" cast iron round griddle. I have used it for pizza - preheat first either in oven or grill. And I have baked fruit tarts on it (on parchment) and used it on the stove top for pancakes and griddle items. You could leave it on one of your burners and use it several times during the day. Even cooking eggs/bacon. Handles for easy lifting."	positive
they sent the wrong color	negative
Huge gaps on the sides on my outer thighs. The material is very firm/molded so the parts on my outer thighs stick out and look ridiculous. Havent been able to wear. Found ones on amazon that look more like shorts. Those work great. I really wanted to like these too. **My body type is curvy, size 6 pants, wide hips, normal legs for size (not sure if this helps)	negative
The bristles are so spread out and it hurt my scalp. Don’t feel like it detangled better than any regular brush.	negative
The cord broke within two months, the sounds quality suffered. It got progressively worse until it completely stoppped working.	negative
Was easy to put on wall. Able to wash the chalk off with water and a paper towel!	positive
Beautiful mic. Works well. But why send the bright blue and red foam mic cover and blue grip piece for a black and gold microphone.? Goes from Classy looking to trashy real quick. Oh well. Here's hoping the batteries last. Would love for this to be rechargeable.	positive
The only thing that keep it from being five stars on everything is you have to hold the power button the whole time.	positive
Very warm and fits my huge head.	positive
Grossly disappointed in the quality and looks nothing like the advertised picture	negative
works as advertised, came 3 days earlier than expected.	positive
I loved these! They fit great and were actually flattering. I did wear a bra underneath them because they don't have any padding, but they had the same type of clasp of my bras so it was easy.	positive
These provided good compression in my calves but not through the foot and ankle so my ankles blew up after my 12 hour shift. Won’t be able to wear to work again.	negative
I love it! Great quality and weight.	positive
My mother wasn't able to use it to hold her paperback books.	negative
Movie was fine, but shipped without a case. Not specified in the selling description. Now I have a movie without a case in my library	negative
We had purchased a cheap box mattress (Zinus) from amazon and while it served its purpose of not being too 'limp' and hurting my hips, it was REALLY hard. I purchased this to help with comfort and its amazing! I have noticed that I get REALLY hot but guys the comfort is 5 star!	positive
If there’s a breeze this item is not the one to purchase. The breeze will cause them to fly off and you won’t have any coverage on your item.	positive
Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up.	positive
The socks were too short.	negative
I really want to love these bottles but the one thing that drives me crazy is that when you put the lid on over the nipple, liquid still leaks out if turned upside down. The lid doesn’t push hard enough against the nipple. Other than that, I like the bottles. Am I doing something wrong?	negative
I've had this for several months so far. I use it during the week for several hours at a time. I have it under my desk and it's perfect for keeping my work area warm.	positive
Using this for a while now to groom. It's great to use feels great in the hands and the battery life is okay. Sometimes I even forget to charge.	positive
Melted, when put in the candles	negative
My youngest daughter is just getting to the point where she can wear bows. I ordered these hoping they'd work for her, and they're AWESOME! The ribbon is really high quality and the alligator clips are perfectly wrapped to both stay in place and not pull her delicate hair. She loves being able to wear bows like her big sister. Each ribbon has two bows so you can wear pigtails! She's so excited and looks adorable in them. I love these bows; if you're on the fence, do it! You won't be sorry!	positive
The top has a bit of elastic backing that keep them up, and then you have to wrap them around and tie at the bottom, but they look great, just a little cheap, but that is fair for the price.	positive
Great product! Great to use extra at the first sign of coming with a cold. Very helpful!	positive
I typically get simple face wipes with cucumber, or similar products. I have both sensitive skin and dry skin. I found these wipes to be very astringent, and honestly they kind of burn me around my eyes/the most delicate skin. They were also drying. Would not buy them again. Pretty much scent free though.	negative
I'm very disappointed. The product is as advertised, but I paid an extra $3.99 to have a GUARANTEED next day delivery. It was not delivered until two days later. What good is paying for guaranteed delivery when it doesn't get delivered?	negative
This is a great idea but I was disappointed that it doesn't fit my Shark. I may duct tape it to the hose for spring cleaning but can't use it for everyday.	negative
Great quality! For reference I am 5'5 140lbs and bought a small. Love the detail on this shirt. Isn't see thru at all. Washes well (hang dried it). Definitely recommend.	positive
Not even worth 5 bucks. It’s super zoomed in and pixelated as far as design goes. It feels like dollar tree material and was not accurate on size to boot. Not sure if it’s worth the money to return but these are definitely trash.	negative
Do not go by the sizing chart on the box. If you have large hands order a size up. They are nice but they run small and can't be returned.	negative
Love the shirt but is a bit wide for the size. I wish it weren’t too wide.	positive
SO DISAPPOINTED IT CAME BROKEN....ITS A BEAUTIFUL MIRROR. IM AFRAID TO ORDER ANOTHER....	negative
I’m 6ft and 145lbs. I order the size 4 and they fit a little big but that the look I was going for. I could have fit into a size 2 just fine. I love these jean	positive
The glass is thinner than I would have liked, but it is very cute and is a great gift.	positive
Screen never turned on.. can't return because the return period passed. This screen was a present for someone .. very upset.	negative
planted these one week ago and three have already popped thru the surface. If a couple of more pop up I will definitely be 5 stars happy.	positive
Very well made. I like the product.	positive
Not happy at all. The bathroom actually smells worse than it did before.	negative
Like these ear plugs. quiets down my wife's snoring.	positive
I am a size 12 male and my wife could not get these on my foot. I will try once I am recovered from surgery.	positive
Beautiful collar! Great quality!	positive
My grandson loved watching the video series, and is now enjoying the books even more.	positive
Bought as a gift. Very happy with the purchase and they were happy with it as well.	positive
Great replacement flowers!! Better than the originals!	positive
Cute book, my five year old loves it!	positive
I love this polish but this is a complete rip off. It states that it is for 6 cans but you only receive one. Price $39.00. They do not except returns on the item so your stuck with it. Wish I had never ordered. Don't be duped like I was.	negative
Well written and great illustrations!	positive
Stopped smoking exactly 7 days ago.	positive
Have to work too hard to get it to tap on. Ended up rep,acing it with something else.	negative
This item Started failing about halfway through my project.	negative
I had high hopes for this product, but it simply doesn't condition hair well. I still have most of the bottle remaining, and have since moved to a better product.	negative
I ordered this product. It looked like the package was never sealed so when it got delivered, the package was completely empty 😡	negative
The material doesn’t look cheap, I liked the zipper, it works smoothly. Perfect for all my accesories while traveling, I can keep my charger from getting scratched when I am flying all the time. It is a great protective product.	positive
I like it but it was too heavy	positive
Looks good but depending on what you are doing, you may need to order more...	positive
"These are my new favorite pants for working out. I ordered the purple and they are a great color and fit great. I will definitely be ordering a few more pairs in other colors. The price is fantastic for the quality. They do hit lower on my leg then in the picture, but I'm 5'2"" so I expected that. The pockets are a great bonus."	positive
Bought them for my boss. He wears crazy socks and he loves them.	positive
I love this product. With the ability to change settings it allows my kitchen to stay lit once it starts to get dark and looks great too with the design. I was going to spend the extra cash to install lights under the cabinets but can not justify now. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!	positive
bought multiple of these, all work well. no issues at all.	positive
The first use of the product has broken.	negative
made for perfect decorations at our safari themed birthday party! everyone loved it got so many compliments and the foil balloons were SO BIG and BEAUTIFUL	positive
The shirt was ok but funky around the chest area. Kind of fits but a gap by the chest and arm pit where you can see the bra	negative
Kind of hard to blow up, the air hole is pretty wide so keeping the air in after removing the pump was difficult. Did not have a strong smell, but still would recommend letting it air out before use. Used on a 14 hour flight. Oh and would recommend a small blanket for the bottom of the face hole, it was slightly irritating on the chin area.	positive
I tend to like plain rosewater. My skin might not like the glycerin, but someone else might still enjoy this product. I got dryness and splitting after use.	negative
Loved the characters and the dialogue....the plot twists and turns keep the reader fully engaged from beginning to end....hard to put down!	positive
Don’t buy it! The fit is horrible!	negative
For the price, it's great! You may want to get some LokTite for added hold on some of the bolts, just to be safe. I've got a 65Inch pro Samsung 4k tv mounted and it looks and works great. Instructions are a little confusing but not horribly so. The over the TV shelf mount works great and you can easily mount a surge protector to that.	positive
Hi this is a great product I used to cover some fondant letters.	positive
Too many cherries and red dye whatever.	negative
Smells strongly of chemicals. Glitter flakes off. Very, very stiff -- I returned.	negative
i wear medium so i order medium but wayyyyy to big so i just decided to give it away n order small size instead but unfortunately it looks like an extra large just waaaayyy too big	negative
Perfectly packaged and very cute, simple and elegant. Bought these for my bridal shower.	positive
Handles are much to long making scraping in tight places impossible	positive
Sunglasses were very nice, until I went to the beach. The sea water that splashed on my glasses, left an ugly shadow on both lenses.	negative
nice small unit- worked plug and play with the tv-	positive
"Would give it zero stars if possible. I am not sure what's ""improved"" about it - it is virtually useless as an olive oil sprayer. Also, the button is very shallow, which means it requires multiple pumps to get an adequate amount of spray dispensed. Very uncomfortable to use for that reason - hand gets tired quickly. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY if you are looking for an oil sprayer. Might be better with a thinner liquid like vinegar, but I wouldn't risk wasting money on it."	negative
Truly awful feeling pillow cases. Returned immediately. No amount of washing would ever make them feel anything other than a tarp! They did seem durable, so if you don’t need comfort then this would be great.	negative
Good reference book to refer to as needed.	positive
Cheaper than the other similar products and comes with a nice case to keep them in. Have not tried on screws that were rusted in but did work on some that were in plastic appliances.	positive
Best slim wallet I have ever purchased. Extremely durable.	positive
The product is great! Good quality! Though... the seller send me the pair of fines ! one fin small and the other XS	negative
I want to avoid deodorant containing aluminum, and I’ve tried several. This is the only one I’ve found that works and doesn’t irritate my skin. I’ve only used it in the winter months, so I will have to see how it holds up in warmer weather.	positive
Had a small one of these but couldn't find it so order the pair. These work very well for me. The velour is on the front and back so I can go in either direction as needed.	positive
worse thing i bought ever in my life	negative
These bars were mailed by post office. As it is hot everyone of my bars were melted!!!!! They are not fit to eat!!!! They should have mailed these bars in a ice pack!!!!! I will not order again!!! So I lost my money and bars!!! What a rip off!!!!!	negative
I didn't like it , but it was the affordable for me option stick to the original if you can afford 100.00 Plus. I could have DIY'd this and it would have been better more to my expectations easier to handle ...	negative
I have heard it too many times, but something in this book and it’s author made it make sense and it turned the light bulb on brighter than I could have imagined. I hope everyone reads this and has the same reaction!	positive

My hummingbird love it ,it's like a.hummingbird freeway around my house.	positive
Didn't last a whole year before it just died. Would recommend for emergency use only. Otherwise, don't bother.	negative
During assembly it seems like it was made as cheap as possible. Easy assembly 1 person but you need tools. Drill and rubber mallet. The stickers make it look better but I hope they don’t get ripped off. It came missing the braces for the floor. I think step 2 sends you missing parts for free though. The floor is a great anti fatigue mat. Kid loves it he’s 2. It takes up more space than I realized. You have to have room to walk around it.	positive

Absolutely cannot get lotion out of bottle... despite storing it upside down! I will have to throw out.f	negative
I’ve only wore them once and I’m on my feet most of the day. They felt broke in the first time wearing them and my feet felt good all day. The sole seemed a bit firm but not bad. I’ve had one other pair of Merrill’s and loved them. Happy so far.	positive
COFEE IS BETTER, ICE IS CLEANER, WORKS GREAT	positive
I chose a four star rating because everything can be improved... I really like the book because it gives you an idea of how Mr. Buffett invested. It also shows that you can invest the same way and hopefully one day be as successful...	positive
Its deserved some more if I wish I could make that. So helpful,life changing materials as easy guide.	positive
I was very disappointed. I don’t think it had any pineapple taste at all.	negative
I ordered this and when I opened the first box it was broken. Amazon processed a return, told me to keep the broken one, and then sent out another one- no big deal. Second one arrived, again broken, and had to receive refund. If you order be cautious- staff will easily break in shipping.	negative
Product was add the ad stated. Came in timely manner. Only bad thing was it smells horrible. I washed it twice,still smelled bad. Or it in washer for third time and let it soak overnight,then rash through wash again. Still has slight smell. If not for the smell would have given 5 stars.	negative
"I've had the US made bottle opener for a few years and then decided to purchase the BBQ set as well. It's frustrating to see ""Made in China"" on the spatula blade. Does it still flip burgers? Sure. But I could have paid $3 for a made in China burger flippin' spatula."	negative
Junk. Every time the phone falls a short distance the protector falls off. The last time it broke from a 1.5 ft fall.	negative
One has broken already.	negative
It works well and very easy to use, however it leaks charge when you take the charging canister off. So you have to keep it on the entire time you’re using the product.	positive
Very fun to play with several ways to increase points as well as building puzzles and playing other games in conjunction with it. Love it!	positive
It seems to be comfortable had I ordered a larger size. Other then being to tight very comfortable.	positive
I don't have anything negative to say about this case. For the money, it's fine. It's a bit harder than my other cases and I did think it was going to come with a screen protector. The protector was blue? So there's that. It didn't work. But if you are looking for a decent case to protect your phone, this is it.	positive
A little tricky to put on the first time or two, luckily I had help. The straps under the arms are easily removable as well if you’re not a fan, a definite plus. Has that amazing leather smell even after a lot of wear.	positive
Over the last few years I have just about switches all my casual no show socks over to Polo. I wear a size 15 shoe and it’s difficult to find socks that are the right size. These fit perfect.... the only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is depending on which shoes I wear ever so often the back will slide down to my heel. It’s not often nor is it with every pair.	positive
The key fob looks right and everything looks right, but when you put the sleeve on your key and try to close the fob, it won't close all the way The key works. Kind of tacky. I should have just bought the cheaper ones.	negative
Worst table ever and a wast of money! No e if my parts match and the screws are in the wrong side of the damn table!	negative
Not very well made. The voltage controller will not sustain 24/7 used the camera will burn out after a few days of use. Don't use more than 5 or 6 volts and even then its life expectancy will be short.	negative
Got this for my husband, thought it would be a great gift that would last. I was wrong. The letters rubbed off within a few weeks. Not worth it.	negative
Literally what the headline says. It's super cute and perfect for my room. I just wish it was a little bigger. It really helps carrying my stuff up and down the stairs; better than the basic square baskets. It also allows me extra room in my closet and as I redo my bedroom it fits perfectly! I'm really glad I made this purchase.	positive
it is was too small in the arms and shoulders otherwise I loved the dress so I am bummed	negative
Tips came in all busted up Ordered twice same result Called company to get new tops Never got them Would not even return calls after I tried again and again	negative
I now get all of our local channels for free (12) and they all come in just as well as cable, etc. I'm not tech savvy but connecting the antenna was super easy. I did have to place the receiver in a window and having the 20 ft. cable enabled me to do that easily. I got rid of cable/Dish and now I either stream or just watch the local channels. I would buy this antenna again. The price was good as well.	positive
Came quickly and are working great! I thought I would have to trim them to fit in my fridges crisper drawers, but they fit with no trimming.	positive
Worked great. Lasts about 4 hours of pretty heavy use hanging drywall	positive
The item fit well and was received in a timely fashion.	positive

Worked for 2 weeks. Now there is only a purple patch on the mirror where ther used to be video. Would have liked to use it but cant. Wanted to send it back, but its to much of a hassel. Sorry, wont buy it again.	negative
returned it without any problems	negative
Great way to expand your photography and have fun doing so	positive
they functioned okay. they just fell apart off 2 separate keychains in under 4 months. now useless and turned into quite a hassle	negative
Does not charge, broke my controllers. I plugged them in overnight and now they won’t even turn on. I am now trying to charge them using the regular PS4 cord and they won’t even turn on. I need new controllers	negative
I love it it is amazing game to play but after you lose you watch 2 to 3 adds so I'm with you guys	positive
The packaging looks used, the purple highlighter writes like it’s been used, and the pens inside looks scratched like they were used. Not a fan.	negative
I ordered the 10 gram option and it was supposed to be delivered by Tuesday. It's Wednesday and the order is not indicating that it's even shipped! I obviously cancelled the order.	negative

I just love Pamela’s work. She truly knows how to get the reader invested in the story. She makes you in love with almost everyone you meet. She has a gift of story telling but also giving you a message. There really are good people in the world. At least we can hope!	positive
We haven't noticed a flavor, so kinda surprised by that factor question. 🤔 but my ex-military husband really liked these. They are sleek and presentable.	positive
Bought this for my 10 year old son’s birthday. It broke within one hour. It just stopped moving. To send it back Is at the customer’s expense, almost as much as the cost of the product. No thanks.	negative
It made my plain old key fob look classy and expensive. It looks very much like it is part of the key fob and not something I put on. Very happy with this one.	positive
One of my dog's may be allergic to an ingredient...to be determined. He is itching constantly, so will experiment with other foods.	positive
I gave this toy to my 8 month old labradoodle and went to the bathroom. By the time I was done, the feet were gone and she was working on pulling the ears off with her teeth. Not durable. I wouldn't recommend for a dog that does a lot of chewing.	negative
They fit well and do not leak. I don't use the ear plugs or nose plug, but keep them in case I change my mind. Very nice!	positive
This grinder isn't very easy to clean. Took it apart for cleaning and noticed that the grinders are misaligned: unable to set different coarseness. The corns are loaded through a plastic side door that isn't particularly secure and could open and spill. Do not recommend.	negative
Purchased this bag as a gift - it was on an Amazon baby registry. Bag started ripping after 3 uses and now the strap is totally broken after a few short months of normal use. Edited to add: the seller is sending me a replacement bag at no extra charge and have been great to work with. Hopefully the second bag is much better!	positive
We purchased this for our young daughter as she absolutely loves it! The animals prints are very cute and the set itself seems very well-constructed. The only drawback is that the cardboard material which makes up the carrying case is not particularly sturdy and does not seem likely to last being played with.	positive
Really appreciate the basic packaging. After the cord on my MacBook Pro failed, I ordered one from apple, but it was the wrong one. This one though, works like a charm!	positive
The embroidered parts looks good, the trip looks sloppy.	positive
Really cheap, not even sure if it will hold up to holding the sword at the Renaissance Festival this year.	negative

The pictures shows the scarf beautiful. Upon receiving the package i was happy with this scarf.And then decided to wash it and see if i could get fade. Washing worked and i then tried it on my little girl.She wears so cute. It is exactly what i was looking for.Thanks	positive
Very nice slippers. They fit well, and are nice and warm, with good quality materials.	positive
Looks a little cheesy, a little smaller than I thought it’d be	positive
I used for 2 weeks and the bluetooth connection no longer works. Poor quality.	negative
Very loose. Returned item as it was very baggy as expected, but too baggy to be worn as anything other than ren fair attire with corset and shelf bra? Also very see through, even white under garment would be extremely visible. Went with different color and thicker material as more multi purpose.	positive
They look like they're more expensive. The only downside is that they're a little bit heavier than I thought they'd be.	positive
I've worn this about half a dozen times and the stitching is staring to come out one of the braces.	negative
Very nice looking case for the iPhone x! Have clear cut outs for charging port, speakers, headphone jack, camera and also the apple logo! Nice feel	positive
"The minimum waist size for this item is 40"". Even with twisting the waist belt, it slides right off. This is not suitable for swimming or water parks unless your waist measurement is 40 inches or larger. Also, the black bag is transparent, so it's not suitable for carrying credit cards or other personal information."	negative
Awful Too expensive for a piece of paper	negative
Not yet tried if it is working but it seems good quality. I need to set it up and wait to see.	positive
Live in a hands free city, used this to back up my usual ear bud when driving. Sound is great, folks hear me great but it is not the most comfortable in my ear. Quality product with good sound, though.	positive
Well written story about life in India and what some people will do for power.	positive
I was disappointed when I received this blouse. It does not come in the pretty color it shows in the photo but a bright neon yellow.	negative

I bought this kids camera for my son. It is easy to use. The picture has cute frame. My son likes it very much. This is a great gift for children.	positive
The clip on my gopro hero 3+ case broke so I ordered this for a replacement. I'm glad I can get replacement parts instead of having to buy a whole new case. Fits perfect and so far works great.	positive
Excellent image. Would be 5 stars but included the wrong sized nut.	positive
Very poor quality of magnets and items doesn't stick or remain firm.	negative
Good Sci-Fi - wouldn't recommend to young readers	positive
Beautiful inexpensive phone case	positive
These are nothing but jump rings with a bead ball. Once you open the ring, you lose the round shape along with the alignment to the ball. After multiple attempts just to get it through my piercing, I couldn't get it to align and close again. I didn't bother trying the second one so you can see the difference in before and after opening. I'm returning them because they are worthless as earrings now.	negative
This is the second set of these I've had..and the motor has quit in one of them each time. Guess I will have to send these back too. So disappointed. Edited to add: I am going to change this to a 4 star as the seller has contacted me with an offer of a refund and replacement product. This kind of offer goes a long way with me and hopefully the new set works well.	positive
Unit was substandard. Motor weak and failed within 3 months Bad value	negative
This machine will turn off by itself at random.	negative
Good motors for a kids projects.	positive
These are my favorite pair of shoes as far as how they look. However, I have other Adidas shoes in men's size 8.5, ordered a size 9 in these, as suggested in other reviews, and they are still very narrow compared to my other Adidas shoes. I stretched them and that helped, but I probably should've ordered a 9.5.	positive
The clothes are short.	negative
Too thin not sturdy enough. The size is exactly what I wanted but the material is ridiculously thin. This should be noted in description so as not to disappoint consumer.	negative
This unit was to be a direct fit, it was not and no wiring diagram so I could make it fit. The company was no help at all. I sent it back and got a EONON which I would recommend to everyone!! P.S. Amazon was great!! It wasn't there fault it was the company.	negative
Good product. Thank you.	positive
It loses calibration after a couple times of opening & closing the blinds. I’ve had it for about 2 weeks & have been recalibrating all 3 of them every other day. It’s nice to have them on schedule mode but they’re always uneven & it’s annoying to calibrate again & again.	negative
Put this in the printer and it showed to be empty. Tried to print and it screwed up the alignment. Returned it and purchased same product at Walmart and worked perfectly. This is the second time I've bought ink from Amazon and both times it was junk.	negative
The product arrived in good shape, but there were several items missing. We were missing a couple of parts, all of the hardware, as well as the instructions. Had to return the whole item.	negative
Did not fit my 07 Silverado. Lugs are not long enough to thread onto the lugs on the truck.	negative

For chilling, napping, or wear like a headband while working or cooking. Great not to have a headset shoved in your ear. Sounds great!	positive
this is a comfortable shoe	positive
Awesome holster for my LCP...fits like a glove and stays in place in my waist band	positive
Loved this flashlight for walks at night and for general use around the house. However the lanyard broke off after about a week and now a year later the memory function on the light broke and it barely functions anymore. I tried charging the light and the green light never came on after at least 18 hrs, and it should only take 5.5 hrs for a charge. Despite the metal casing and the rough durable look, this is a cheap light and I would not recommend.	positive
Philips bright white backup light does not fit in Mercedes 2002 CLK 430 backup light. The 1156 terminal base is correct but the bulb does not fit in the lens.	negative
I really have not used it long enough to know whether I like it or dislike it but we will see at the end of 44 days but I will be ordering it again!	positive
Top sheet was small and the fabric was not as soft as I expected.	negative
Even though they fit as expected once started wearing the shoe does stretch! if wear for a long period of time start to get a blister on little toe. I do love them and glad I ordered. BREAK IN at home before you wear them out for work or evening. Easy to clean.	positive
Woohoo! Ranger One in action. Love the direction this new series is taking. Mix in a few new characters, a somewhat flawed AI and justice is served. Pepsi anyone?	positive
I ordered a medium for my small beagle and it was so small, it didn’t even close.	negative
The thickness of the case does a great job of protecting the phone, but the thick hard rubber button covers were difficult for me to feel and operate. I like the kick stand back and the way it protects the phone. But if you are a heavy user, I can't recommend it.	negative
I like the size of the popped kernals, fluffy and flavorful. When I pop it very few kernals fail to pop. I bought it for my personal use and loved it so much I ordered a 6 lb. bag for my son and daughter-in-law. They love it too!	positive
I had difficulty cutting with exacto knife. Edge too jagged. Had to discard part of roll.	positive
Super cute and I loved this case for the 4 days I used it before the ring broke off already. Super disappointed.	negative
Works pretty well for us	positive
The battery life is amazing, this thing works for multiple days without needing a charge, and you can even use it while it is charging. However, the left earbud is not working after less than a week of use - and get this - it stopped working while I was sitting in my chair not touching it. I heard what sounded like an electrical short through it, and then it stopped working completely. Very shoddy - definitely not working $50, I wouldn't pay $10 for something that doesn't work for an entire week.	negative
This is a cute addition for our kitchen remodel. We had gray and off white tones and this matches great on the walls. It would be perfect for any room in the house especially a living room or nursery. Rustic and shabby chic; I really enjoyed it. Of course, Amazon delivery was quick and easy. To spruce up a space, go for it.	positive
Doesn’t look like the photo. I’m 5’3 165 curvy muscular build ...it’s a little tight....ordered a large ....I should have gone up a size. Or I guess I can lose 10 lbs .... Either way. Not worth sending it back. I can make it work and dress it up.	negative
I ordered two of these and I only received one package.	negative
Really high wasted, fits bigger then expected.	negative
As soon as they got wet the paint or covering came off. breaks easily too. All the fins are already gone.	negative
Used for my son first bday it looks perfect	positive
Over price... Wal-Mart half of the price 2 days free shipping.	negative
I am pretty disappointed in the quality of this set. I installed yesterday and there are already spots of the matte black chipped off the set. In addition, the deadbolt is super stiff and doesn't track smoothly. Very poorly made.	negative
These arrived with some kind of black oil/grease all over them. It washes right off your hands but I've never received landscape pins previously that had such an obvious coating of black on them. Other then that they're fine.	negative
It is nice looking but cheaply made. One of the nails on the closing strap that attaches it to the chest came out after opening and closing it just a few times.	negative
"I bought this to pick up fresh fruits and vegetable at our co-op. It is study and holds a lot. The handles are strong, as it gets pretty heavy at times. I have used it for a variety of other tasks also. It may not be as pretty as some of the ""book party"" totes, but it is good and sturdy and works great for me."	positive
Finally found the right filter for my Samsung fridge! Works like a champ.	positive
This is a great shower head for the price. We mounted it on a hose (not included) and use it to clean the shower. Also the wife uses it for rinsing out her long hair. We use a fixed round shower head for showering.	positive
Love this case! I have gotten so many compliments on the case. I will say that it catches finger print easily because of the metallic. Also it is prone to scratches but just be extra careful with it. I will say that you do have to press down a lil more than normal with this case. My favorite color is blue and the shade of blue is the nicest I have seen. I like that it covers the entire phone. Very easy to put on.	positive
Well...needless to say they are taking some getting used to. The toe box being bigger is great. However still trying to determine if the heel not having the padding like other shoes is good. Just a matter of time.	positive
These are very cute but the elastic on the back is flimsy and way too loose. It took some time to tighten it so it wouldn't slip off the light fixture. I expect it to break before the end of the season with the snow and wind.	positive
What a great product, works like it is advertised and was shipped and delivered on time. No 5 star because the battery that came with it was empty. Definitely a must buy.	positive
I got this book because i had mentioned to a coworker I wanted something spooky to read. A few coworkers told me this was the book for me. Sadly, I did not enjoy it... The beginning was the best part as it droned on... I finished the book (not enthusiastically) but it is good if you have no UFO or alien beliefs. But set aside some time to decipher the ramblings through most of the book... sorry guys :/	negative
I got this to put on the vertical side of tall headboard.. its the only option i have. So when its attatched it sticks directly out from the wall/bed 90 degrees. To extend the pole it twists.. as a result of the way ive attatched it wont stay put in this position. I consider myself on the weaker side of average, i can open most food jars.. really had to muscle this thing to bend it into form. Does not fit my needs.	negative

Carlos seemed to enjoy it... I can't wait to show him off in it.. So funny... Carlos is 11 pounds. Large fit him perfectly. (He's got those thick thighs) I like him front facing..I can make sure he is comfy and I can see people's reactions. He has been on my scooter in his carrier to ride to a park... Had his paws on handlebars like he was driving. He loved it.	positive
Arrived quickly, very sturdy, husband had no trouble assembling it, and it looks so beautiful in the bedroom. Fits a lot of cloth , in style. Great choice, would highly recommend this to anyone.	positive
The broom was sent w/o all the parts could not put it together and NO product insert or instructions	negative

Very well manufactured and easy to put together.	positive
Ordered this product and the adhesive was damaged. I got a return item and that was damaged too the exact way. very unhappy with this product! It wont even stick to my phone	negative
Easy to use. My processor is Heartland and this worked perfectly	positive
It is a wonderful outfit. Love the design and material. Only thing is the bottom tie is too big and the top tie us a little too small. Other than that it's great	positive
Great for our garland! Used it as white cloud garland for our rainbow backdrop! Perfect! I would recommend buying two bags always better to have extra than missing balloons. I loved the size. I did add a couple of 12” white balloons cause I need more!	positive
Buyers BE AWARE! I received this product in a open teared box and the expiration date is in a few weeks!!! In addition, this product CAN NOT be returned. Don’t waste your $$$	negative
"Great product, I was anxious to get my hands on a set. I do ""Re-purpose"" hobby crafts, upholstery, painting and general handy man stuff. An impact wrench is overkill for most of that, but a good drill with a set of relatively inexpensive sockets and a set of impact grade socket adapters and you don't have to be a mechanic to do mechanical and craftsman chores around the shop or house!"	positive
I bought this to replace the OEM lock that came with my Yakima rack. It works as expected. With that said, it is at best a deterrent against the casual thief. It can be knocked or pried off with a hammer or crow bar.	positive
Box completely collapsed when they arrived. No sign of damage to the strut assembly. Install process was simple enough, but alot of heavy lifting is involved. Vehicle needed alignment after install.	positive
I lose hair like it’s my job and my plumbing is not a fan. I have not had one issue with clogged drains since I bought this.	positive
The pink color was different from the picture. didn't like it.	negative
After a few uses I still noticed no difference. This product did not work for me. I just bought a purple shampoo from the brand Philip B and after one use noticed a huge difference. I wouldn't waste the money on this.	negative
I put two of these up and both fell down within a few days. I put them up with the command tape it comes with, them it sit for 24 hours without any weight as per the instructions and both fell down before the week was out. thankfully my my cameras didn’t break but it did crack the shell. these are a great idea in theory but they need a better way to mount them to the wall. command tape just isn’t enough. really disappointed that I wasted $25 between the two sets I bought.	negative
An interesting, easy read. Beautifully written.	positive
Very comfortable but doesnt like to stay on the bed even with a mattress protector and fitted sheets. I have had to readjust the mattress several times and now have to find a solution to it slowly coming off the bed with each time I get up.	positive
I really enjoy using this strainer. Its' flexibility makes it work on any size pot or pan I want to usse it with.	positive
My daughter LOVES this set, so that is why I’m giving it two stars. Unfortunately, the necklace is in over 50 pieces across my family room. Still missing a few beads. Brutal.	negative

I purchased this charger Dec 30 2017. worked good for2 months. Now plugged in not charging. I dont see any warranty information.	negative
These are completely useless as the hole in the backing is too small for the post of an earring. What a waste of money.	negative
The adhesive is much stickier and more secure than I thought it would be! But even though it is sticky, it doesn’t hurt to remove. Just make sure to go slow. This is a godsend for certain dresses when I don’t want straps to show. I worn it comfortable for a whole day with and off the shoulder dress and had no complaints. The material is also soft and seem well made.	positive

It's not worth the price nor it's accurate!!	negative
Mounts seem to be a good decent quality, but mounting threads strip out before they are secure enough not to rotate(even with the proper rubber insert, and 2 sided adhesive foam tape provided). I would suggest a mounting hardware design change with bolts/nuts instead of relying on short Allen key machine screws threaded into a soft medium.	negative
Sometimes it works great	negative
Wonderful. I had to put some baby powder on it take our the shine. It's looked too shiny. But after I put some baby power on it it it fabulous	positive

The power strip is sitting on my shelf. I was disappointed to learn that the outlets are not individually controlled - the entire strip is turned on or off.	negative
Big hit with teenagers at Christmas.	positive
This remote is certainly easier to use than a game controller for watching videos. However, the button placement is not optimal. It is very easy to hit the wrong button because they are so close together. On the plus side, it works seamlessly with the ps4.	positive
The main motor doesn’t even work. Not worth to buy at all!	negative
Found Amazon to have the best-valued price for the DA29-00020B water filter I needed for my refrigerator. The exact replacement part is always the best buy.	positive

Amazing product. Looks amazing on my Mini. And great quality. Best purchase ever!	positive
I like these boots because I have wide calf and they fit well. The only thing I don't like about them is they feel very cheap however, I'm keeping them and will probably look for a nicer pair.	positive
I would give this 5 stars but it’s very long. Had to tie in a knot to prevent from dragging on the ground. Still really cute though! Super soft and has pockets!! 😍 I’m 5’ and 115lbs I ordered a small	positive
Sent as a gift. She loved it	positive
Fits great but the material used for the inside is already coming apart so I know I will not b wearing these too many more times. This was not a good purchase and shoe was very poorly made	negative
Till this day I have not received my backpack nor does anyone from the company respond to my emails.	negative
Very comfortable for what it is. My son really doesn’t like stuff on his face but seeing he like to go under water it does just the job. Doesn’t seem to fog up like most do. Doesn’t leave huge red marks on or around the face and doesn’t fill up with water.	positive
These are baby toys, actually. We thought they were the squishies that all the kids are so crazy about right now, but they're not. They're actually plastic and kind of hard. Sort of like a dog toy.	negative
More like no stars. The sunglasses didn't sit flat. Sent them back. They were cute but work	negative
Delicious on meats, poultry, seafood, gumbo and just about any dish!	positive
Says fits all 900 does not work on my 2015	negative
The skirts zipper is broke....	negative
Should have gotten a larger size. It is warm.	positive
The image shows four bells. The title of the item does not indicate less than 4. The actual quantity of two is not clearly indicated except buried in the item description. The amount paid ($7) is far too high a price for the actual amount of product (2).	negative
There was fast shipping but I didn’t like the shirt at all. I’m 5’7”, 130 pounds. I got a medium and it just hung on me. It has a weird neckline that was choking me but then flared out. It does have nice material and is a pretty pattern.	negative
Love the backpack good for the price I recommend it from for women and medium men I’m very happy.	positive
I would purchase again for family if I needed to. Nice qualiy	positive
This tape is way too thin to work with.	negative
The main reason I bought these is because they are supposed to be scented, but they don't smell at all. The barrels on them are enormous too.	negative
cheaply made, worth about $3 at best	negative
Trash do not get this item it came and it did not even work	negative
Tom is always a good read but his books just go on and one and on......... Plausible story line especially in light of today's news.	positive
Boots are nice quality. Run a little wide for me. My feet slop around in them a little. The color is more burgundy than brown. Overall nice boot for the cost.	positive
top cloth layer of insole started separating after only one day of use. these insoles are replaceing 6 year old timberland insoles that have not seperated in any way. i dont think these are timberland insoles. probably china knockoffs. bought a pair of felco pruners that were proven to be knockoffs. had to reorder them from felco to get the real deal. i think amazon is slipping. to big to manage??????????????	negative
Great quality. Almost looks like real thing from far :) there is no Gucci logo. That's what gives it away :) Over all amazing size bag. Comes with two straps, leather and material stripped one. Took close up picture so you can see the quality of it. It's gooood. Both can be worn as cross body or as shoulder bag. I really like it honestly!!	positive
Most annoying “watch” ever. I can’t bare that stupid Asian accent	negative
Not the best. Connects to the internet via the Ethernet. Does not provide enough power for an external hard drive through the USB ports.	negative
This book is marvelous to peruse and I think this book is the best book of this theme and I truly value this book.	positive
Did it's job, removed breakaway screws from a Chinese ATV carb with no problem.	positive
There's five minutes gone that I'll never get back.	negative
It was not what I expected. I need lots of soothing and anti friz. This does not have it.	negative
It didn't put a lot of dust in the air and was easy to clean up. It was pretty effective in battling fleas.	positive
foam is not sturdy and despite only minimal use has begun cracking.	negative
It was poorly made and thin material cost 10 cents to make and to much for costumers would not recommend it	negative
I am using these bags as well as their smaller bags for compost and they are holding up much better than an other biodegradable bags that I have tried. They are great!	positive
This camera works well and their customer service is phenomenal. Nightvision and regular vision quality are amazing. I would have gave it 5 stars, but the App to view the camera feed occasionally freezes and at times the camera will start spinning around when trying to adjust.	positive
I had to give 1 star 'cause didn't let me write a review without choosing at least one. Watch didn't work properly, maybe was something from factory, maybe not.	negative
THIS IS THE MOST UNRELIABLE PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. WORKED ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN ......... BUYERS BEWARE .....	negative
I love this. I bought it for work.	positive
Very goopy, flakes off, not smudge proof, and bottle broke so that the rubber stopper doesn't get off excess mascara. Unusable now.	negative
No assembly was nice. Made in America 👍🏻 Arrived in open box, one bent stake which I managed to straighten, no packing slip (probably due to completely open box) Perfect addition to the garden. Would purchase again.	positive
So cute, my child loves it!	positive
Fit perfectly. The area between the seat and console was constantly a mess. I couldn't keep it clean. This catches every crumb, coin, and paper.	positive
I just finished reading this book and it was awesome! I fell in love with the characters and I couldn't wait to see what happened next from chapter to chapter.	positive
Doesn't work at all!!! Waste of your money.	negative
This hose lasted me 4 months. Less than half the time as the other 2 I have tried. The nozzle is stiff and hard to turn.	negative
I did not receive the book that I ordered!! I am very dissatisfied!!! Plus my item arrived late !!	negative
i really havent read enough of it	negative
2nd set purchased and they work like a charm. For those who don't long charging cords, these come in handy and clutter free.	positive
Very easy to install on my Ipad Air 2. Quality is great as is usual for Otterbox and it arrived on time and packaging was in good condition.	positive
I've always liked Plantronics devices and this one is no different.	positive
This takes forever to charge my phone. I gave it away.	negative
Arrived in good shape. I don't like the little metal strips to hold in the cheap cardboard backing but I made it work. I should note that the plexiglass is highly reflective making it difficult to see the whole photo in a brightly lit room.	positive
Pickle-nuts will like this crunchy treat. Not a Brit but I wish the US had these.	positive
My grandson loved it.	positive
Disgusting, like drinking soap. Just bring your butter coffee to work in a thermos.	negative
I should have known if the promise is too good to be true, it's probably not. This was a total waste of $30. I have a Christmas tree with a section of lights out and this DoD not help. Do not waste your money.	negative
Good design, looks. Phone will easily fit. However, it takes maybe 20% more time to charge than the standard Samsung Fast Charger.	positive
Trying to eat healthier so we tried these and they tasted like packing material. Definitely won’t buy them again.	negative
These are the best product I've tried for keeping glasses from slipping down the nose on hot, humid outside days. I found them to be very comfortable too.	positive
Did not care for the effect of the very next day felt kind of drowsy all day long have since then stopped taking them	negative
Did not get the handles with the order.	negative
I liked how soft it was .. I have no dislike at the moment but I will be getting it redone and I’m going to see the results afterwards	positive
Very disappointed in the quality. They warped badly after the first use. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is they do fit the grill.	negative
I love this tea but I received the wrong product. I received stomach ease instead	negative
The product sucks me on great!!! The product doesn’t make my booty look flat either!!! I will ofer more!!! Just wish the straps would tighten more. Other than that I love it! If you are not use to wearing shape wear or thongs order up a size!	positive
Bought this because my cat is extremely smelly when he used the toilet, this kept my place from smelling like a shelter! Love this litter box!! Highly recommend! Easy to clean, big enough for more than one cat, and I love how it keeps the smells inside, as long as you clean it regularly!	positive
Such great truth and wisdom to instill value in your sons!	positive
Well made. Good heft to it.	positive
Yet ANOTHER great album!!!	positive
Did not fit the series 1000 Norelco razor	negative
Love this, well made. Adults can even sit in the chairs I ordered	positive
A very good book with lots of action and suspense.probably will continue with the test of the series. Quick read.	positive
The light these gave off was good and I really like the look of them. Pulled them out of the ground the other day and noticed that the tabs on about half to 3/4 of the lights had broken off for the stakes that put them in the ground. Might try to glue them back together, because I do like the lights.	negative
Just now getting around to putting this sensor on my Tahoe 7 months later and confirmed that while it will fit it is the incorrect sensor for my vehicle and will not program.	negative
The quality is really good. Its non stick with a sturdy build.	positive
I was also sent the wrong item. I received the rattle instead. I'll be keeping it because it's cute, but I'd still like to know how I can get the stuffed hedgehog??	negative
Any breeze at all causes it to swing all over. It free floats from the top causing it to be constantly moving. I had to replace a rivet with a bolt on the top piece. I wouldn't recommend this umbrella if you have any sort of breeze. Also the necessary umbrella base is huge. I realize it has to be. This is my first offset and my last. Price is fair. I have another regular umbrella I bought from them and it is awesome.	negative
This is not a strong product. Has fallen off 2 times now! 2nd day of being up!	negative
I love this tea. Tastes very good.	positive
I bought this for the lemon scent bags thinking it would mask the scent of the dog's waste. It does not do that at all. I was disappointed and I could have gotten the same type of biodegradable bag cheaper. Won't repurchase.	negative
Great battery pack for outdoor. Last long and very durable.	positive
Good product, I recommend having a professional install it though. The material is thin and very easy to mess up. I had to order a second one and I am getting it done by a shop.	positive
I am very pleased with my purchase. The quality is great. It is a perfect learning tool as well as decorative.	positive
Easy to place and leaves no spots or annoying little bubbles. I was super excited about it until I actually tried to use my phone with the protector on. You have to press so hard for it to even register that you are touching the screen. I took it off after an hour because I got tired of having to push down so hard just to send a text.	negative
Not a good read. A lot of words that really don't add up; and the author is a bit too wordy-- goes off subject a bit too much for me.	negative
I like the size but it definitely does not do the job as a regular size ironing board does. Will make do as I can no longer handle the regular size.	positive
I've had this for a few months now, still working on the initial charge, and it works well.	positive
We hoped this would help cut the knots out of our dogs fur. It does not work as well for that application but it makes for a good letter opener.	positive
I really love this case but it does not fit the phone properly. The phone doesn’t seem to fit snug in the case and I am afraid it will crack if it falls	negative
I was pulled over 4X in 30 days for having my tag lights out. Every time I looked, they were on but dim. I installed this and fixed the issue.	positive
This apparently constitutes a book in this century of ours. The non-existent lord help us.	negative
Material was very nice.	positive
Great books with good story lines. I love a good romance novel these were perfect! Not too long either, that is nice.	positive
This product is not for human size, this is good for pet! Too small! Such a waste of money! Do not buy this product!!!	negative
Just received this stud finder and put it to use immediately. To me the most important function was deep scan. I have sheet rock over plaster in some areas and this finder worked extremely well in locating studs and live AC. It was simple to set up and use, instructions were clear. I cannot speak for durability since I have only just begun to use it. But it is far superior to others I have used at the same price level in the past.	positive
Fabric is hot....wear in colder weather	positive
I did not like this at all. runny and oily	negative
They work well but the front headlight pieces can be difficult to align when reassembling after changing the batteries. Someone stole my first set and I broke the headlight in my second while trying to un-jam it after inserting the battery holder wrong. Also, if you remove the lights while the bike is locked outside to prevent theft, the taillight turns on very easily if bumped in your bag.	positive
After assessment I like it but not love it because one piece came broken. Also the directions are in black & white with pictures not that easy to see. Also when I opened the box everything inside looked like it was all just thrown in there, I thought maybe it was used even tho I didn’t order a used one. Anyways don’t feel like going through a return process because it’s for my nieces birthday & it won’t come back on time.	negative
These are great, perfect size for salad dressing for my husband's lunch. Will definitely buy these again when I run out. Buy 'em!	positive
Cooking love using it as my lid.	positive
In theory these would be cute and work well. I could only wear them a few times. They shed all over. The material must be cheap. I couldn’t wear lip gloss or even chapstick because all day I’d be picking threads and pieces of these gloves off my lips.	negative
These work great! I like the way they wrap compared to others I have used. The thumb hole were to small so I had to cut slits on two side to get them to fit, but this wasn't a problem. I also going to order a second pair.	positive
Cell phone case. Shipped quickly, item is as pictured and easily fits phone. Happy all around.	positive
What a disappointment! How this was not discovered when packed is tough to see. So exicted to get this piece of furniture for my wife. It arrived with the door on one side fully attached and the other door wrapped separately with no means of attaching it. The piece is very heavy and had a huge hassle repacking and getting it returned. Never again.	negative
This is maybe just too big for my tub. It absorbs the water in the tub which makes it heavy and it slides down into the tub. It does stick to the tub but it slides. Has to be wrung out after using of course, but its a lot of area to squeeze. I DO love the little black sponge that comes with it.	positive
I expected better suction.	negative
Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.	positive
These are super delicate and the frame is simply thin wire. They look AWESOME but be careful when storing!	positive
This popsocket is NOT holo! It's a picture of something holo printed on plain glossy paper. My daughter was very disappointed, and we waited extra long for this to be delivered (we expected that part based on the delivery date stated) just because it was supposed to be holo.	negative
the birds are beautiful but the only thing is to find a branch or some way to hang them with the curve on it to make them look straight.	negative
Great read very interesting topic. Surprise ending was a little disappointing in my opinion. As usual, the author researched sleep disorders thoroughly	positive
About 20% was not Lego Technic pieces, but just regular bricks. A couple of pieces were damaged, and a couple of pieces were not even Lego brand. Lots of specialized pieces, I was hoping for more beams and pegs. I will get use out of maybe 30%, not worth it.	negative
This is a very nice, fun play set for the kids. Our grand kids love it. Lots of things to play with and things to do with it. We haven't had sand in it yet but maybe some day. Seems to be very sturdy and well built.	positive
This kept my interest from beginning to end! I enjoyed it immensely! Kept me guessing how it would all turn out.	positive
Not name brand and colors are not bright	negative
All of the characters paint was messed up, my child asked my happened to them. She will still play with them but not happy about the quality of the characters paint.	negative
Didn't bother taking on trip since it would expire in 9 months and wouldn't serve me into next season.	negative
It was much smaller than I thought	negative
It says it has a .5mm raised edge to protect the screen. Looking at the side view of the phone, the phone is definitely taller & will not protect the screen. My son loved the shark design but I had to return it.	negative
Sorry I have to give it even one star. Not what I was expecting. I need to read the reviews first. It's weird, sick and demented. Waste. Of. Time.	negative
I really like the water pressure on this shower head. It is amazing. But the product is made with cheap plastic. Hopefully it holds up overtime. Overall this is a great product and I would recommend.	positive
This product actually works very well and holds up all day. The photos you see with the condensation inside the package is because it is a CREAM kit, and will have moisture. After opening, I haven’t seen any additional moisture. I apply this with a powder and liquid foundation, although would work better with a liquid.	positive
The speaker is nice looking, small and light. It looks exactly as the photo shows. The sound is ok. Definitely not Bose quality or even close to it. But for $18 the sound quality matches the price. I’m using this speaker for my bedroom, so it’s fine. I wouldn’t use this as a speaker for a large area like a living room.	positive
Wonderful, understated, witty film. A real treat and a huge family favorite!	positive
I never received this item	negative
Didn't last long before it broke. Used it twice and boing the wires came popping out.	negative
Why don't they come with lids so we can send to daycare?	negative
Cute. Not as bright as shown.	positive
Faded, ugly, waste of money.	negative
Great game but the low energy/having to buy energy for moves dims this gaming experience. This game has Great graphics and interesting plot and execution but the constant energy low after a few moves killed this for me and really turned me off.	negative
Not what I was looking for	negative
Gave new life to an old Toshiba Satellite!	positive
great costume. Mask has held up to abuse many months past Halloween.	positive
Does not consistently work. Also, gets really warm while being used.	negative
Ear fob cords too short	negative
After use i had tiny bumps on my face like a rash. I gave it a couple days and tried it again just to make sure that the product had caused it and the same thing happened again. Switching to a more natural product.	negative
Didnt fit very snugged to the phone, Loose and flimsy. Had to buy another case for my phone.	negative
Item was never delivered at mailbox as stated... Even went to the post office two separate times and nothing left... Robbery	negative
Horrible quality. Started coming apart just minutes after it was delivered.	negative
Made my crows feet, forehead lines and eye puffiness disappear in seconds. It's like a miracle in a bottle!	positive
A little pricey compared to party city, especially because they fill the ballon for free, however they quality is good and durability was great	positive
Cheap and started to fray right away. Not a canvas bag.	negative
Well I had HIGH expectations for this sock, but it was a Huge let down. There is NO support for the heel, which is why I purchased it, and then with no support no relief from the heel pain. Now it did bring comfort to me ankles but my ankles wasn’t the issue.	negative
good products! thanks	positive
Got this for my daughter for our vacation. It held up well...no frizziness, minimal tangling. The color and quality was amazing. Only had to use a little less than 5 packs. There is a nice amount of hair included.. **Update**Purchased again in an other color combination. The hair is gorgeous!! Thank you	positive
Not what the reviews led me to believe	negative
This swaddle doesn't quite feel the same as the other double sided swaddles I've bought directly from Posh Peanut. I'm not sure on the authenticity of this product. But all in all it feels nice and I like the weight of it. It did not come with the bow I'm a little disappointed with that.	negative
Does not fit, pieces of crap...don’t buy	negative
They are great quality and a great color variety. I don’t need any other bows that we’ve previously purchased because there is a color for everything in this set!	positive
Love these blankets! My husband and I decided to try one out, and after a few days decided to buy a second one so that we could each have our own! They are extremely comfortable, keep you cool (yet warm), and look great!	positive
Daughter is a stuffed bear freak. Loved the outfit, but shorts were a little snug.	positive
Crappy, wish I can have negative rating option	negative
Works most of the time, does become disconnected from hub from time to time. Love being able to have Alexa turn on my fan.	positive
This is a fun game, but be ready to do some thinking the questions cover a lot of topics.	positive
I don't know how it works, because I didn't get to use it. The box was wet on my porch, and inside the bottle of stability was cracked around the bottom edge and had leaked out. Very tired of getting wasted/damaged products from poor shipping practices by Amazon! Amazon should be refunding these things, but they don't seem to care.	negative
Would not recommend as it peels off in one day.	negative
the tube are to soft they bend	negative
So far I don't feel better but I bought a second bottle. If I still have no energy with second month I will have to reevaluate my review	negative
Good reading cross section! Already knew a couple of the authors... Had trouble finishing only one. Science fiction, fantasy and adventure are my favorites. Try it!!	positive
It got a hole down the seam on Day 2.	negative
They stuck to my couch about one week then pealed right off!	negative
Tiny containers of play doh and cheap plastic toys.	negative
A step above in quality to other adapters in the 10-20 USD range.	positive
We wanted the bigger one, but obviously we order the smaller, but it works in our summer cottage.	positive
This screen protector does not cover the whole screen of a galaxy J7 period!	negative
Gave gift to friend, found scratches	negative
They are really small. Would be great for a baby.	positive
The phone couldn't connect to the charger anymore, had to toss the cable.	negative
Great little brush for my Aussie. I wish the bristles on the soft side were a little stiffer but they work great for his face.	positive
Based on the information on Amazon's web site, these filters look like they are OEM, but when the filters show up, they look like cheap knock offs. They do not have the same characteristics as do the Bissell OEM filters.	negative
From the moment I got it, it didn’t work. I had to return it and ask for a refund. Their customer service was great though. They refunded me immediately.	negative
These take me back to being a kid. Great arts and craft supplies for small children. These would also be pretty great to cut borders for scrapbooking.	positive
We needed a light for our piano that would give an elegant look. This light does the job! Plenty of light without being overpowering. For the purpose, it’s perfect.	positive
It's smooth and great to have the ability to have an upper body workout with Cardio. The rowing is smooth and quieter than most rowers.	positive
The bottles themselves are great, however, the actual sprayers leak from the top. Very disappointed as I tried several thinking it was just one that was having this issue, only to discover each one started to leak after anywhere from one use to a day of use.	negative
With lens attached the phone will not focus on any object from down here to the moon. The macro lens works OK so there's that.	negative
Ordered these as a gift for my mom and they’re pretty awful. They stink like burnt rubber, they don’t break in at all and hurt the ankles, and they’re super ugly.	negative
One of the stabilizer feet/flaps snapped off during first use. Oh well	negative
So far so good. Very reasonable price and I’m happy to have a band with a buckle rather than the original stupid clasp thing that wore out quickly and kept detaching. I’m a big guy and would’ve preferred a slightly longer band but it seems to be staying on.... otherwise would give 5 stars.	positive
AmazonFresh packages this in a produce bag and it’s always soaking wet when it arrives. If you don’t immediately use it or take it out of the bag and wrap it in paper towels it will wilt/rot in a day. It also doesn’t require such a heavy dose of ice packs or dry ice for a few hours...	negative
I am very glad I purchased this WIFI extender it really boost the signal in my basement. The reason I gave 4 stars was my router drops signal here and there. So at the moment I unplug the extender until I use my game room in the basement. But the product works very well. Would love to get a second one for upstairs.	positive
Brilliant female main character. Meet-cute with hot but abrasive future boss (don't worry, he has a couple valid reasons for the attitude). Guardian-angel type in the form of Grandma Iris. TOO SWEET!	positive
Took almost a week to ship the ETA dates are not accurate at all, they didn't let me know it was going to be late until it was too late to cancel	negative
This is a novelty book to keep with the Harry Potter series on your bookshelf. It is referenced in the series and makes a nice addition to the collection. My kids have commented how cool the presentation of this book is, from cover to pages.	positive
I love it. I got the red color and it's definitely really really bright and kinda shiny and tangles easily but it's cute and fluffy and fits my alternative look. I definitely get a lot of weird looks its a statement piece especially when your brown skin and have dark lipstick on!! Although i will retire this wig just because it isn't something I'd wear everywhere... Like a funeral or something formal but it's definitely fun to be on the wild side for a bit.	positive
Colors were beautiful and just what I was looking for but I was disappointed in the size of the package.	positive
dropped the bottle accidentally and big dents on it and scraped the yellow color too.	negative
This is definitely a great sound system! I would say it’s an upgrade from the one they had before! It’s a nice and sleek design that looks very modern and nice. The remote is nice and simple to use and connecting it is super simple. The sound is very crisp and clean the bass is good, but I wish it was a little stronger. Other than that it’s a great system that performs very well. Any other questions, feel free to just ask me :)	positive
This product looked super cute for my son's room. I put it up one night only to find it in a ball on the floor the next morning. Followed the instructions exactly. Got a replacement put it up and now this one keeps peeling off. Super disappointed in this product. I have other decals on the wall so this is an isolated issue with this particular product.	negative
Plastic on the bottom near the wheel cracked after only one trip on the plane. Unusable now! So disappointed.	negative
I bought this last year for a costume and loved it. when this one arrived it was packed messy and the hair was messy and did not lay right	negative
My only complaints about this tent is it had a weird smell to it for the first couple of days sure that's typical with any tent & the zipper is loud & sometimes catchy. All the poles & corner pieces are metal not plastic. I put electrical tape at each connection helped with the rattling & the squeaking.	positive
it was made of cheep plastic , fragile, and i use it to make EMPANADAS , IT ONLY CAME IN ONE SMALL SIZE , SHUD COME IN MEDIUM AND LARGE ..	negative
I didn't know what to expect for just under $10 but I really like this band! I was sweating under the silicon band that came with the Apple Watch. This band breathes and the magnet is VERY strong!	positive
Gun ad in the back pages of the book. I DON'T APPROVE! What the heck? Amazon is not allowing me to include the photo... :-( Requested and received a full refund.	negative
They do their job. There's nothing wrong with them. What else can you say about a ball?	positive
Very disappointed, falls apart too easily. Might work if the ends are glued on. I haven't bothered with trying that yet, just took them out of my car & put them on the shelf for now.	negative
I ordered XL in Black but a 2XL was sent. In the process of returning the item and waiting for the right size to be shipped.	negative
Directions were gibberish and it’s not very good for feet ther than baby feet wobbles a bit when you step up on it while on the commode	positive
The product box was torn and there was no charging cord. How can I use it if there is no way to charge it.	negative
Made of foam. Not plastic. Feels cheap	negative
Ring became loose after a week. I don’t even use the ring much. Case overall is ok fits iPhone X well. If you don’t mind the ring hanging there every time you use the phone, this would be the ok option.	negative
Fits a lil snug but it looks great.	positive
I was pleased to get two matching pans with one purchase. These pans offering consistently great cakes.	positive
this watch looks ok so far, but the battery can only last 4 to 5hrs after charge so that means that I have to recharge it 2 or three time during the same day. that is the only downside of it	negative
Unfortunately this item only fits the large BMW decal. It will not fit the decal on the tires or the rear decal.	negative
"I just got it, and the depth is not 3.75"" as stated. It's more like 2.5"". If you're gonna lie about your product, don't make it about something as easy to verify as dimensions."	negative
Does the job & way cheaper than Acura	positive
The case was small. 100s barley fit. It felt funny. Within a day the sequins came off	negative
We bought this wallet for my wife who was in desperate need of a new one. She was very specific with her need for space. This was perfect for her! Enough space for all her cards and business cards but compact enough to fit in a smaller purse. The quality is amazing and will hopefully withstand the years for abuse she will give it.	positive
Framed out and durable. It survived the birthday party and now we just have to find a home for it in our home.	positive
Great product - just what I expected.	positive
Did the job...would def. recommend	positive
Runs small. Couldn't fit it so I returned it	negative
Huge, my favorite brush	positive
Felt very soft but was 2-3 sizes smaller then it said	negative
I did not get the item	negative
The club is excellent. Amazon’s order handling was terrible. Can’t be trusted to deliver expensive items consistently. Customer service on follow up was mostly helpless	negative
The smell is horrific once in the tank.	negative
Very disappointed with these plates. Three of them have already chipped after a month - very easily - simply putting them in the sink.	negative
The lotion works great. I ordered the bundle that was to include lip balm but it was not in the box. I reported it and sent a whole other bundle with lotion, cream, and lip balm. Now I have to figure out a way to get to a place that will ship back the extra stuff the sent or I will get billed again. I wish they just sent the lip balm I advised that had been missing from the original order instead the whole that I would need to return part of.	negative
Gross taste... wish I could return. Chocolate is much better.	negative
I have not been able to make it worl	negative
I have tried multiple different flavours and they have all tasted great and been easy to eat. The price is a little high but you get what you pay for. Some of the more popular brands that you can find at the grocery store or gas station might be cheaper but they are often hard and almost feel as if you're trying to eat leather or cardboard.	positive
This is different than when previously bought. This time it has a perfume scent. It is suppose to be unscented. I gave away all the bottles that I bought to friends who don't have a problem with scent. Did they get the batch mixed up with the scented ones? I love the original unscented cream and soap. Soap is wonderful. No scent.	negative
I've only used once but plan to use multiple times next week and will update my review with pictures. But I did enjoy the first time use. Put them in the refrigerator and it was refreshing and relieving for my under eye.	positive
If I ever saw a pure piece of Junk, this Fitbit Surge has to take the prize...	negative
Bad quality, don't buy!	negative
Only works sometimes. I recommend buy the individual bigger glue dots.	negative
I ordered these pillow cases to use to try and help with my bedhead hair. They are soft and fit my standard sized pillows great. They keep surprisingly cool most of the night and while my hair doesn't look like Rachel's from friends in the morning, I do think it has helped keep the frizz down a bit.	positive
I've been cut/pinched skin several times as I don't have the finger strength to push the wire in enough to get the bottle out. While I like the concept it's too painful for me to use.	negative
Holy muddiness, Batman! These earbuds, while they stay in and don't seem to be affected by sweat, do not sound very good. All the frequencies are there, but there's a significant boost in the low mid range. You may not notice it on rap or EDM material, but on rock, it doesn't sound very good.	negative
All batteries that were sent heated up my phone to the point it shut off.	negative
will not fully charge---- no better than the old you have	negative
Again. You get what you pay for it. Looked and worked fine for few weeks then started looking warn.	negative
I am a nanny and I bought these bubbles for summer time fun with the kiddos. They worked great the very first time we used them, but that was it. The handle falls off constantly, and it is impossible to get the ring out of the inflatable bubble tray. Its extremely frustrating for the kids, and unfortunately we are just giving up and throwing it away. Better luck next time!	negative
This product is very nice. Very easy to use. Comes out very pretty. I use it for nail art. Gonna have to order more!!!	positive
These don’t work for poop situations. What I bought them for. I would go a size up also. Measured and my dog should have been a large, large is a tad small.	negative
A waste of my money ... I bought these for my children as part of a Christmas gift . More than half were defective . I was very disappointed as my kids love these things . It said they were the original Rocket Copter but the were a cheap knock off . So do some home work before you buy .	negative
its great. blocks the sun very well	positive
They're good glasses it does the job the only issue that I had is that it has a blue glare on the lenses other than that they're good.	positive
I’m not sure how people use these. I was drooling uncontrollably and it caused the whitening stuff to foam. I had to literally hold my mouth over the sink and gave up after five minutes. I wish I could return the kit but I waited too long to try it.	negative
Nice product. Not leather; you are paying for the brand but overall it looks great!	positive
I took them for a few months. My nails, hair, skin, no change.	negative
One worked,. When I used the first one up and tried to use the second one no spray comes out. I would like a refund.	negative
I purchased 5 different skinny syrups and not one is worth keeping. The smell of the syrups alone is a turn off but the flavors absolutely not palatable.	negative
"Maybe I missed it, but these are covers not ""filled in"" pillows. I'm still happy with the product."	positive
I am impressed with the design, however, my mirror failed to turn on. I'm going to return it and order another one and hope the next one is fully functional.	negative
Roll Bars on newer Jeeps, we own a 2014 Rubicon and Sport, are too thin for this cup holder...Cheap product quality.	negative
The suit i received was a return, when i took it out of the bag it was inside out and the sticker from the bottom was missing. Unsure if i am going to keep this suit as it fits a bit tighter than i was expecting.	negative
Stopped working after a month.	negative
Optics are very small, crude and not easy to use at reasonable distances to focus. Smallest, most powerful (supposedly) lens not useful unless you might be an elf or creature of similar size.	negative
I dislike the product only because I order one size an they sent me another !! Other then that I have no bad say so about it	negative
I bought this to sharpen my Wustof Ikon knife set, but it did not work. In fact it seem to strip the edge off my knives and make them worse than ever.	negative
The machine itself is great. I actually thought it was going to be a lot larger, but it isn't- which is fine. fits perfectly on my nightstand by my bed. However, the app that goes with this to manage the zenergy is useless. It doesn't work. I had to completely re-start my phone, disconnect and re-connect blue tooth several times to get to reconnect to the machine. I love the machine the integration with the app is a nightmare. And after reading other reviews here and in the app store, it's not just me.	negative
Set up instructions are easy to understand and set up. Have border collie with thick fur so long prongs are key. Like it so far!	positive
This thing is a crock. It barely worked and it broke after 2 weeks of use! Don’t waste your money I’m returning it.	negative
Wasn’t as I thought it would be so I returned it	negative
Works great for my medical supplies I'm using it for.... Its not good to roll around on carpet because the wheels are too small... The wheels need to be just a tad bit bigger...	positive
This battery seems to work well, keeps the remote charged for about a week	positive
I loved everything about the kneepads except, I cannot lengthen the velcro straps to fit around my calf	positive
Fits perfectly, really nice looking.	positive
0 stars. Product never arrived and seller will not respond back. Glad I am only out 5.00.	negative
Pairing and stuff was ok, the button is horribly big, it's like a pinky finger on my neck, also it's not in the middle like in the picture. Sound quality : terrible	negative
Handy buttery case for my s10. Gives me an additional day of battery life.	positive
I live in a 55+ community, and I cook a lot for other residents (esp. chicken soup). These are a perfect size (remember, you don't have to fill them to the top), freeze well, and i clean them in the dishwasher(I hand wash the lids,because they sometimes curl in the dishwasher.	positive
Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.	positive
Only used it once and so far it seems to be working fine.	positive
Great product! My dogs love them	positive
Exactly what I wanted. The case was delivered within expected time. It looks great on the phone and others have asked where I bought it.	positive
Better than $15.00 decals i bought!!!	positive
You will be disappointed.	negative
this item is not original nor working with my samsung phone. i tried to return but i had to the shipping fee which is unfair at all.	negative
Perfect DPI which you can change and the colors also are nice. Cool features such as weights and an app which you can download to change DPI and Color.	positive
These were a novelty I bought on a whim, they DO NOT keep your drinks cold. They look cool but unfortunately that is all they do.	negative
I didnt like that their battery life is so short. They break extremely easy. Also you can pair them both to your phone but you can only listen to one head phone at a time.	negative
Ordered two. Neither work.	negative
Tastes maybe more of a caramel, but it certainly has the toasted marshmallow scent to it.	positive
This shirt is terrible quality!	negative
Good clock with very large display. Odd thing happens once in a while the display will start to blink like the clock lost power. Not sure why.	positive
It's a fairly okay lens at the price point. Not a pro lens, but more like an average to below average build quality, but above average image quality. I ended up sticking with the 24-70 f/2.8 II L lens, which is way more expensive and way heavier, however my photography demanded it.	positive
If you enjoy movies that seem interesting at first but have no real story, zero explanation and no depth, while watching the main characters slowly run to their death due to their out-of-this-world stupidity, then go right ahead this movie is for you. Glad I didn't have to pay for the 3/4 I watched.	negative
Better than the Dirt Devil, but wish it was stronger.	positive
I hope you love the ones you by from this company and that it flatters your face without trying them on even once because they do not offer any returns. They look nice but they look awful on the shape of my face. But I guess I’m stuck with a pair of sunglasses I can’t wear.	negative
After getting my screen setup, it last five minutes and then lost connection. I made sure the wires weren’t loose and yet it still goes in and out of connection.	negative
This knife doesn't disappoint. Such a good value, I use this knife for just about any veggies and it stays super sharp.	positive
not as bright as expected, more on the amber side vs white	positive
This pen is not very durable. I have owned two in the last about six months and both broke at the cap. After the first one broke soon after I started using it I thought perhaps it was just a fluke so I bought another one. That one broke in the same place. There is nothing unusual about how I use or store the pen (in fact I keep it in an elastic band with my tablet).	negative
Seems to be holding up great and are very soft.	positive
really nice cool colour, but does not last long	positive
So this works for a short time. Our cats play with it and it falls apart because its all separate pieces. Get the orange one that is solid it will not break.	negative
These diapers were disappointing, on par with generic poorly made store brands. I’ve tried lots of different diapers and these were not worth the value-added claims or the premium price. I honestly think these were a marketing gimmick. Easy to leak, not a lot of absorbency and they fell apart quickly. Often didn’t even hold up through a 1.5 hour nap.	negative
Product runs small and is uncomfortable . Based on the tags on mine and shown by others, I’m also worried whether these are real or fake. Would appreciate some assurance from Amazon	negative
I like this product very much. They are very well made. I will use them for pants.	positive
Balanced and clear throughout frequency range. Slightly muted sub-bass but mid-to-high bass has full rich excursion. Overall a great value for your dollar for most genres. I do miss the flat cables that came with my previous IEMs; the non-balanced cable tangles easily.	positive
Very nice watch , I guess it will be larger	positive
These are really great...a very good bale making/wire designing tool. Very well made, too.	positive
the product is great. so sorry to say there must be a small puncture at bottom of bottle because inside of wrapper of bottle was all wet. I did not want to go thru time consuming process of returning this item. will transfer contents to another spray bottle. also, my daughter wanted to use the product as soon as it arrived. she is very happy with it, especially the coconut scent.	positive
The tips, once again, were completely wrong for my Satisfyer Pro 2. I advise not purchasing this product until the manufacturer provides assurances that they have changed the tips to fit the Satisfyer Pro	negative
Love the mat! Excellent look and feel! We can tell it is so much better than other mats!	positive
I have purchased 6 of these and I am happy with each of them. I look forward to doing business again. Thank you. :)	positive
This computer is for my son for homeschool. It meets all of his needs and is wonderful. Love the touch screen option	positive
This is the worst product ever tastes like plastic very disappointing	negative
I hate to give bad reviews, but they gave me the wrong cord to charge the battery packs :/	negative
It is durable, but doesnt sustain ice as said. Same day I put ice, it melted. Water stays cool, but ice melts quickly.	negative
Got my package today and upon opening it I decided to test the light and it didn't turn on. Took out the batteries and bought additional ones and still didn't work. Really wished I could've tested the product to give a better review but unfortunately I can't.	negative
Very cute! Little difficult to work the belt loop for attaching to bag but I know it won't fall off!	positive
We received the bed last night and the chemical smell is unbelievably strong. I took it apart and put it outside to air out. As of this morning the smell has not improved. I can't stand to be next to it, so there is no way I am going to put our dog in it. I will be returning it and looking for another option.	negative
Not much flavor as far as I can tell. Doesn’t impart much flavor I should say, which could be good for some.	positive
It works and fits great. The best perk for me is that its light and doesn't make me overheat while working outside.	positive
One bulb died already with only one week of use	negative
Unfortunately the book was labeled “new” but all 4 corners were damaged - like it had been dropped on all four corners. The cover was also damaged. I would have preferred to pay a “used” price for this book. Otherwise the instruction inside the book on drawing heads and hands is excellent. The book mostly focuses on heads, so if you’re looking more for hand instruction I might recommending trying another book. The book covers a lot on proportions and different expressions.	negative
It's a good, standard Figma figure. The only issue can be while posing Zelda, the dress can get in the way.	positive
Nice stroller but kinda cheaply made with the zipper. Dont think it will last long.	positive
Cheap quality won’t stay on . Had to return them.	negative
The perfect size. Very well constructed. I would definitely purchase again!!	positive
I put my daughters hearing aides into the plastic sleeves. She wore the head band for about an hour and then asked for it to be removed. When I removed her hearing aides I noticed the plastic sleeve holding the hearing aide was torn. The plastic isn’t durable enough for children. They give you an extra sleeve but no way to put it on without ruining the headband.	negative
Not good quality for the money you spend.	negative
It's a lovely case but the one I got didn't line up properly. I am unable to use my headphones because the port is partially blocked :( I was very disappointed!	negative
I originally ordered this machine and it only worked for about a day. I reached out to them and they went ahead and sent out another machine which has now been working for a couple of days just as it should. They handled the situation properly and the machine puts out a decent amount of fragrance.	positive
After I adjusted this belt to fit it loosened within minutes. I tried reversing the clasp and found it did the same thing. There is also a problem with the clasp, it is hard to secure and will come undone often.	negative
My 3 Maltese love Whimzees. They get so excited when they hear me get the bag.	positive
Very nice and has a classy look to it. I really enjoy looking at it daily. Great purchase!!!!!!	positive
A little leakage is not very good	negative
Not a durable product. Stopped charging altogether	negative
I sent it back. Poorly made	negative
The first few times it came off extremely easy when interacted with water but the third time I had to take it off to replace my sensor and it left me with skin irritation and sensitivity. I loved the idea of it but in the end ouch. If a new product comes out I would still love to try it, but for right now I just hope the rash doesn’t stay for long.	negative
Great condition and got it before xmas. Kids loved it!	positive
This seems like a great bag! I haven’t given it too much mileage yet, but I love how it is payed out and organized. The pockets are large but stay slim. You can tel the material is a little on the cheaper side, but it looks really nice.	positive
Small returned couldn’t fit my foot inside very tight	negative
These are great!! They are all funny!! Will definitely be used!	positive
A great bargain. It’s already proven it’s durability . Accidentally it was knocked to the deck and no problem whatsoever.	positive
very flimsy for garden use.	negative
I love them something always different to send my jewelry in my business	positive
These worked for about 7 weeks then the sound was not clear. Also, when talking on the phone using these, the person on the other side said that there was a lot of crackling and could not hear me. I recommend spending a little more then wasting money on these.	negative
Strings are long! A little snug, but fit ok.	positive
Main wrap is not elastic enough for comfort. It does not expand or the sewn down parts prevent expansion allowing for comfortable breathing.	negative
Item arrived on time and when plugged in worked. I would buy from seller again.	positive
it looks cheap in person	negative
Phone is not attached in the wallet the phone falls out of the wallet when the phone fell out of the wallet it cracked the screen I am very very upset now I've got a phone that the screen is cracked and it's a new phone this is not worth the money I spent on it	negative
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, VERY CHEAP BUILT AND WILL DIE SOON	negative
I really like this band, it's fit and the clasp is easy to use. I was able to reduce the size of the links very easily with the kit that comes with the band. My only problem is how the color came off almost as soon as I started wearing it. I like this band and don't want to wear a plastic one.	positive
Love it, I bought two for the front and back of my Chevy hhr. Looks super cute and the paint on the flowers is still holding up even after a year in all seasons	positive
Really?! You couldn't spare 5 cents to give 1 extra piece. Now I'm stuck with a wobbly drawer and have super glue on my hands. And no, I did not over tighten it. Product might be 5 stars for all I know, but this is so ridiculous I had to stop installing just to make this point clear: INCLUDE EXTRA PARTS!! I'd be willing to change this review if customer service makes an effort to correct this.	negative
The shirt was too tight and see through. I ordered a large which is my normal size and way too tight. The sleeves were super cute.	negative
I am not happy with this product they fell apart in less then a year, warranty was only good for six months. Unfortunately I trashed the old ones	negative
The necklace is very beautiful, charming, delicate and unique. I bought this for my sister for her birthday. It also comes with the description of the cancer sign what is interesting.	positive
These bags clearly have a scent to them, which burns my nasal passages & makes me cough. My guess is that trash bag companies may be adding chemical pesticides to their bags to deter insects & that could be laced w/ a scent to mask the chemical smell. Perhaps the manufacturer would care to respond to my comment.	negative
Don't remove the plastic packaging until you are familiar with all the parts and how they connect. Once I did that, the process was fairly straight forward and no tools were required. Took me about an hour but for someone who does stuff like that regularly, I am sure it would assembly more easily.	positive
Good case so far that is very slim to the phone. I like that there is not a very bulky case around the phone to hide the beauty of the iPhone, but you can tell there is protection. I have not dropped the phone yet to test and hope not to lol. Aces so far.	positive
Works great for what I bought it for but came scratches with a piece of the edge gone.	positive
Like that its simple to put together and has various tips for different spouting. Dont like that it takes FULL sun to work.	positive
Its very pretty and waterproof but I didn't have it for long it ripped.	negative
I tested positive for ovulation for three days in a row?????? I thought woman only ovulate 1day ???	positive
Good quality. I will buy again.	positive
it protects the screen. no interference with touch function, I did not notice at least. manufacturer tried and make installation as easy as possible, still challenging for first timer to avoid bubbles. maybe second screen will stick better.	positive
Terrible fit. The color didn’t look anything like the photo and it didn’t look anything like the photo in the cut of the dress. I was very disappointed!!	negative
I use this for my treasure chest at work after the kids get done with therapy. Nice variety of farm animals. Oddly I got it for the horses (because a client loves horses) but all of the horses are an odd orange color.	positive
This book is a rip off of a New York Times bestseller that was published last year. It is repetitive.	negative
this arrived with one package and one panel. It is confusing after reading the question/answers as the seller states each panel is 3 feet wide. Returning as I need 4 so will buy from another seller.	negative
Easy to assemble and looks nice.	positive
These fit perfect, were easy to install and a great price...	positive
Exactly what I needed to keep receipts in order	positive
Super cute! Great for bride to be!	positive
As shown. Arrived very quickly.	positive
Works perfect came sooner than expected.	positive
Had the TV for a month and my dog chewed up the remote. Bought this as a replacement but it is not an exact match as it does not have the Ambient Mode button so you either have to use the SmartThings remote app on your phone or turn the TV on and go to Ambient Mode through the dashboard. Other than that, works fine. Easy to pair with TV.	positive
I had a couple of issues when I first got the kit. The vest was not sewn quite right and one of the blinking lights did not work. They were immediately responsive and quickly shipped a new complete kit. Customer service was GREAT and I will give the products as it stands a solid 4.	positive
Easy to install. Battery power great at first. Lasted days with normal usage. 4 months later, the battery doesn't last as long. Has to be recharged every other day or so. But still a HUGE improvement over the original battery! For the price - I would buy again!	positive
High quality gown for Barbie or Fashion Royalty dolls. This is beautifully detailed and looks great.	positive
Great price for tdi full synthetic oil	positive
My daughter doesn’t like it but, it’s made well and works.	positive
Very sexy and fits well	positive
I use this when I fly to watch my downloaded movies. It works great and the patter is super cute.	positive
These are comfy and fit fairly well. I'm not in love with the stiff texture; I imagined they would feel more like the super soft laser cut undies you can get from VS.	positive
Love this game because it requires strategic thinking in best move given the cards you have	positive
I have used other volumizing powders in the past after reading these reviews I was really pumped to try it because I have very thin fine hair that is cut into an A-line bob that could use a little extra volume Unfortunately this product is not for me it feels like glue not powder so it makes it possible for you to work with your hair very disappointing money down the drain!	negative
I ordered a small in yellow and the dress is way too big for me so I will be returning. The color is a bright sun yellow as compared to the muted yellow they advertise in all of their photos.	negative
I really like this product I got first time in june when the pack only has 6 in it,now it comes with 7 and the price is great I reordered it now so I could share it with my son. I got him ,I got him a Pur filter for Christmas.	positive
These are working out great for my vehicle. Big improvment.	positive
It came with a hole in it and is a bit misshapen	negative
False advertising Picture showed plants not seeds	negative
"For the price point I'm keeping this and will try to figure out how to clean up the white smears all around it. Just got it today, these photos are of the item straight from the box to the Jeep. Very easy to put on, 31"" fits perfect on my wheel."	positive
You can hear the caller fairly well and media as well. However the caller on the other end cannot hear me unless I talk reaally loud, ( borderline yelling ) and they say I am cutting in an out. Good for listening to media, but not ready for prime time with phone calls.	negative
Delivered late. Product broken bad bad experience. No recommended	negative
The side stretch bunched from the top all the way through, looked as if I had a kangaroo pouch.	negative
Not much to it for adults, but it is great for children!	negative
This book provided a great overview of meal prep. I liked that there were several different options for meals per week that you could choose from. While I haven't tried many of the recipes yet, they all look and sound delicious. It's a great guide for someone who wants to learn how to meal prep, with easy to follow directions, suggestions and recipes.	positive
It's just a cheap cord it works what I need it for	positive
Sent back. Size issues and it what expected	negative
The premise of the story is ridiculous. Out of morbid curiosity I finished the book. To be honest I skipped parts. I already felt it had wasted time I would never get back.	negative
It's a beautiful keepsake box. I really love it! Shuts tight, received it nicely packaged, and it's not too bulky but still made with sturdy wood. The details are amazing as well.	positive
This is the second tube we’ve purchased. Relieves muscle aches very well for my wife; not so much for me. A bit expensive, but for us It works better than many other similar products.	positive
I got these headphones and I absolutely LOVE them! I like how it's very sturdy and I cannot hear anything but my music!	positive
Works pretty good for me. Will order more.	positive
The product arrived as schedule but upon unwrapping I noticed the letters were on the opposite side for placement making it impossible to apply to the wall. Therefore the art is useless	negative
I sprayed this all over the house and even straight on our animals, didn’t seem to make a difference	negative
These arrived beautifully packaged and I cannot wait to use them in my next bath! Each and every one smells so good and underneath the colorful paper they are wrapped in another layer of plastic. They would be a great gift for someone or even yourself.	positive
Cheap Looking. Guess you get what you pay for...I'd return it but not worth what it would cost to do so. Tossing it.	negative
Good case for the price.	positive
it rain out of liquid after 4 applications..	negative
For an old kitchen sink fit and worked great	positive
I liked the way it started as it grabbed me and I did not want to put it down. It was somewhat shrouded in mystery! The writer set the stage for unraveling the story!	positive
I like that this was easily trimmed to my personalized length. It's a bit thinner than I prefer though, I wish it was a little wider. Also the little loop that should hold the excess after buckling isn't attached. So I hung up the belt, didn't notice it fell off and now my cats have stolen and stashed it. For the most part I like the belt though. I really like I can make it smaller as I lose weight without having to buy a new belt	positive
I bought this for my son who is the quarterback and after only two uses a broke in half! Not a great product for your loved ones who you’re trying to keep safe!	negative
I love these Leggings! They fit and feel great!	positive
My daughter loves it. The sound quality is pretty good for the price.	positive
Haven't installed the cat yet, but they are very nice quality. I also thought I would only receive one for that price, but when I opened the well packaged box, there sat two high quality catalytic converters. Highly impressed this far, and I'm sure that won't change even after install.	positive
We received our replacement pot yesterday and it was broken like the first shipment. The glass cover was smashed. You need to protect the cover better and check each pot before shipping out.	negative
"The premise had a lot of potential, and it was really good...up until the reveal. Then she was just like ""lolz, it's okay you're a man-whore"". Totally lost me after that."	negative
If you buy this, immediately cut off the straps (see photo) that are designed to go between the seat and back. Our husky got under the cover and got his head stuck in the strap and started choking. They are too small and a danger to the dog. I cut them off.	negative
Perfect Banner , shipped quickly . Very happy with Seller and Item. Thanks	positive
I ordered this for pictures and quickly realized the colors are way darker than the stock photo. My daughters have mustard yellow dresses and what looks yellow is bright orange in person.	negative
It didn't cover the whole screen....not even close	negative
Did nothing for night glare. Waste of money.	negative
overpriced pain in the rear end, YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL WRAP THE CORD AROUND A TREE	negative
I Love the colors and shape of this bag. The fasteners are cumbersome though. the velcro fastener is too short and pops open. the side latches are stiff and loosen.	negative
Works out good, easy to put together. The only thing is that the track system for the top draw that locks was missing.	positive
It’s fine and it works well with my new iPad mini BUT it just looks dated. I’m keeping it, and it is a great value for the price, but it’s not super cute.	positive
Scammers used an Amazon number. Don't buy gift cards online! Cannot trust it	negative
Great character. Houses our mini lop rabbit. Would only recommend for single small animal	positive
I ordered two. Received one that didn't work. The data/specs printed on unit can not be read. Don't buy from this vender	negative
It took me a second to get used to it. I was replacing an old timer that I knew by heart. I really like the large display	positive
I'm a side sleeper and this definitely was not for me. I have to sleep with my shoulders on it to feel properly supported. I ended buying another pillow because this one didn't do the job	negative
good quality, solid built, but hard to use.	positive
Came on time easy to use would buy again	positive
Fake terrible product	negative
I ordered this item and i never received it. In tracking the item its shows its shipped but thats it. i am planning on canceling order	negative
2 of the cables arrived not working. I am so frustrated ordering cables from amazon now. This is my 4th batch in 2 weeks where they die immediately. Shitty.	negative
Didn't come on time as all my Amazon Prime orders do when they say they will.	negative
Not made for zero gravity chairs at all.	negative
Worked for like a month , and it just stopped working as I did no damage to it	negative
I got as far as trying to open the product. The net was completely dead stuck in the zipper. Returned and did not reorder. I can imagine that this would happen again when trying to close the zipper of the round case, the net could easily get destroyed if forcing the zipper open.	negative
Loved how strong all the women are in this book. It's not just the main characters who show courage. Even little tiny Carly can protect herself. And I loved the end when you find out about Brin the sword.	positive
This has not been installed yet. But I was happy to find one exactly like the one being replaced, which is almost 20 years old. Hoping to encounter no installation issues! (Waiting on a relative to help with the install).	positive
This is the start of a terrific series! Awesome book!	positive
This book is a good book, short read book and it was very interesting as well, It is actually great for me to read a book that inspires feminism. I found it is really helpful book. I enjoy reading this book.	positive
Curdled and chunky in water. Smells/tastes like baby formula.	negative
Perfect and a great deal!!	positive
In just about an year this MW simply stopped working. Nothing happens when we connect it. From the other similar reviews it looks like this is a frequent problem with this product. Amazon needs to remove this item from their website.	negative
The speaker sounds great, but my only complaint is the controlling of the volume. It requires a hold down of the button, and if you let it go it will either skip or start over what you were listening to.	negative
Unfortunately, I am unable to use the rack as the top section is unbalanced and items slide off when placed in the top section. Rack leans forward when items are placed on top section. Does not set level.	negative
Not the best. Hair fly’s everywhere. Takes even longer then when using other tools. Buys more pressure on your hand. After a couple of minutes it’s hard to hold.Not worth the money.	negative
So, I know this forum is not meant for me to review the book. Good thing as I am only 1/5 of the way through but I am enjoying the story. That being said, ordering was easy and the book got to my doorstep fairly quickly. I will say that the print is a little on the small side and it's not easy to see even with my 'cheater' glasses. So, for those with older eyes, perhaps there is an edition of this book with larger print.	positive
I, like most people, bought into all the hype surrounding Days Gone. However, it shares little in regards to The Last of Us. You play a tool of a character, with a weak storyline. The controls are laggy and sloppy, for everything from shooting to riding the bike. This title was the biggest letdown I’ve had on play station yet! If your too curios buy the disc, so you can sell it and get some of your money back.	negative
Good value but definitely not sturdy enough for anything you're going to be using daily.	positive
I bought this as a gift for my son's friend, it is so nice and I am gonna buy one for my son too!	positive
Not sure why this happened. The screen went black with one sliver of light in the middle. Since there was no way to fix this problem, I had no other choice but to return the item. Amazon sent another one out in 2 days since it was within the first 30 day of purchase. I hope this was just a one time problem.	negative
Excellent crochet pattern book from a top professional.	positive
Battery just work less than a day and the touch is sensible a lot	negative
The item i received is defective. I really hope the replacement that Belkin is sending me works.	negative
product is fine - it is being used for after surgery	positive
If you like headaches this bonnet is your friend	negative
Seems to be good quality.	positive
The wheel looks great and feels great. Mines was not bent at all. I am deducting 1 star for the fact that the sticking is kinda off on one side of the wheel, not a huge deal but it can upset ppl who want a nice look...stitching should be even and clean.	positive
The kindle kept telling me it was connected to low power charger. I am updating my review because based on my review, the seller sent two new cables. Incidentally, I am not certain if was the cables, but evidence that my kindle battery was giving up the ghost.	negative
In the past, I Always used tempered glass screen protectors, this was actually easier to install and won’t break or shatter like glass. Good product	positive
Not sturdy markers sign won't go away easily	negative
I’ve only been taking this for about 2 weeks now but it does seem to do what it says and works better then other products I’ve tried	positive
I like the way Mr. Good writes. I've always wanted to grow a couple of the evil tobacco plants, I don't smoke or chew, but I like the smell and look forward to making some tobacco based insecticide. Fun read, wish it was longer.	positive
The switch for the driver's door window in my 2009 Accord broke. The window was down, of course. This unit enabled me to raise the window, but it broke some of the door locking functions. For example, pushing the remote unlock button once is supposed to unlock only the driver's door. With this unit, it unlocks ALL of the doors. And, locking the driver's door from inside is supposed to lock all doors. That also stopped working. I'm returning it, and getting the genuine Honda part.	negative
Over all these are a sturdy option for wireless earbuds, however the sound quality is not great. Very little bass. There are probably better options for the price.	negative
I really like the design on the cover. It took a minute to figure out how to prop up a tablet and doesn't do as well as I had hoped it would for this use. I still really like it and the materials seems like it'll be durable.	positive
Seem good at first, but this Toner does not print well and has started leaking and affecting my color printing. When toner is warm, color pages print out faded. Prints lines even after gently rocking toner side to side. If I could get a refund on this, I would. Never buying remanufactured 3rd party toner again	negative
I used this awesome dresser as custom built in drawers in my bedroom to closet conversion project. It's solid wood, paintable and no one would ever know it's a dresser the way I built it in! I love this quality piece of furniture.	positive
Is even more beautiful in person, the colors are gorgeous and it’s pretty well made.	positive
Nice quality outfit. XL is really what a XXL or XXXL would be.	positive
Great bandages had surgery on my nose. These covered fantastic could even shower. On the third day I changed the bandage because it felt better to have a new one on. The bandage could have lasted another couple of days. I hope I never need this again but if I do I certainly won’t have any problems ordering again. Will recommend to friends. By the way these were the same bandages the doctor used.	positive
Supplies power to lights as expected.	positive
These were really baggy in the thigh area. I'm returning them	negative
It is comfortable...	positive
I thought my old one (same exact model) of 12 years was broken. Turned out to be my trailer wiring. So I returned the one I bought and am still using my old one. You can't get a better recommendation than that.	positive
I thought they would’ve fixed this by know but Speck doesn’t seem to care that their products are defective. 4th one that breaks after less than 2 months of usage.	negative
The rear female connector were too far back under the rear back rest to connect the male into it . It cost me about $20 to buy parts to extend the connectors.	negative
Bland case. It fits tight around new Mac air which is about the only nice feature. Otherwise pretty bland product.	negative
Very happy with the product. The bowls have good thickness and great color	positive
WE opened the game up on Christmas Day and there was no bloody game. TO add insult to injury, my son accidentally took the case to school with him and we only just got it back and wouldn't you know we missed Amazon's deadline to get a return. Really shabby.	negative
I bought this for my grandmother, she had a cheap harness for her dog. This one is sturdy and gives us a great hold on him. He was about to slip out of his other one. I love the handle on it as well. It gives us control when trying to keep him near. Also, with this harness I am able to tether him to the away so he doesn't jump around the car. I would highly recommend this harness.	positive
Standard small tank heater. Works well out of box. Probably good up to 20-30 gallons	positive
I'm a big fan of Skechers and have several pairs of this brand. This sandal however, broke after just over two weeks. Going back. Want my money back!	negative
Toe seam proves uncomfortable after a few miles.	negative
This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth.	negative
LOOOOVE! If you own a cricut and want to engrave metal this is the product you need! It's so simple to install and use	positive
I use this light to cure alumilite uv. Clear and it works great. And it is sturdy built.. I will probably buy another..	positive
Can't put much force behind it or it slips	negative
Very easy to read. Points made sense. Only person you can control is you. I plan to re-read ,exercises are worth doing.	positive
This fan was great when we received it. It worked perfectly in our small conference room. However, two months later, it started making a terrible sound and stopped blowing air. It started to smell like it was burning. Conveniently, the return window closed a month before it broke... only had one month to return it! I would not recommend this product!!	negative
5 foot 10, 145 pounds. I ordered a small, I love it, looks just like the pics. Its definitely a tunic, not a dress for someone my height anyway. Sleeves a too short though so I took off a star for that.	positive
I bought this for my son ‘s birthday but it’s too small for him and the window to return/exchange is closed.	negative
My husband loves the shirts I like them because they do not shrink after washing hold it shape also thanks	positive
They look and feel very cheap.	negative
I paid for a new book and recieved a torn book.	negative
The cable that came with it was defective. Took hours to figure out why it wouldn't connect to computer	negative
Fun toy but hang onto those balls as if your life depends on it.	negative
Beautiful addition to our back porch.	positive
Motor and servos seem fine, but like others my ESC smoked out on takeoff.	negative
Love the beanie, although it does tend to slip off the little one’s head easily.	positive
They work as they advertise	positive
Doesn’t have a solid back. The sole is huge. Not very stable. Ok for walking around the house, but that is about it.	negative
After putting it on the duvet and sleep several nights. I was immediately happy with the purchase! Personally, it's the perfect weight and softness. I'm comfortable. Not too hot, very light (depending on duvet and it’s real soft feathers can see through the light). I don’t think duvet can be washed so I covered with duvet cover.	positive
I really like it I use it everyday it's very convenient for me I have diapers and clothes for my kids just so you did just to Grab & Go	positive
Great fabric. Stitching falls apart after a few washes.	negative
You know what a power bank should do, and this one does it very well. Very simple, but very useful. It is a lot of extra energy for your devices. I've been using it for a couple of days, and it lasts so much! I don't have to charge it every day. It storages a lot of energy. I love the fact that I'm able to charge two devices at the same time. This feature works fantastic.	positive
This drone is fantastic.We love this drone. It’s a good size.It was fairly easy to fly.You can pair it to your phone and then watch live video footage as you fly it. The picture quality and video quality are excellent. Really pleased with it.	positive
It’s orange my Fav color but the function is terrible. I drink ice tea that I squeeze some lemon into. If any pulp gets into the mix it plugs the straw almost immediately. The way the straw pivots back when you drink it gets stuck in that spot. I wanted to love it but it’s a NO go for me.	negative
Product is made small. Ordered 2XX and they are too small in waist even with elastic. Also unable to return as they come from China.	negative
Bought this airbed to replace another that leaked constantly. Was thrilled that even with 2 people on it, this bed did not need air for 3 nights. I am happy to pay extra for an airbed that will hold air and that is comfortable for my guests. Also has a remote to add air, which is a plus, but I'm happy my guests didn't need to use it. I will happily recommend this bed.	positive
the indestructible frame has already snapped / broken and the lenses are easily scratched	negative
This mouth rinse is good for whitening teeth. It could have more of a minty experience, but it is good as is. The rinse foams in the mouth, do not swallow it. I think rinsing with water afterwards is a good idea too.	positive
Died in less than a week	negative
Didn’t work with pro	negative
Did not even have the pool but a year and it’s so rotted around the frame that it just broke! Not worth it! And they had to replace it once before bc they sent me the wrong parts	negative
Feel like I wasted my money.	negative
Perfect gift for our grandchildren as my husband drives for UPS	positive
For a to go bag. Works really good!	positive
These are small not medium. Not as described do not order from here.	negative
This is not the same old story. You can't guess what happens next. A great quick read. Don't judge the story by the cover	positive
After the first use they became difficult to fluidly eject medication, which is not useful when administering medication to infants.	negative
It will not fit a 1 1/4 house as it said in the description when I ordered it. Great scam.	negative
Great shoe. Third pair I've owned over the past 3 years. Well worth the money.	positive
Tried several times to use this and it keeps getting stuck. I thought it was me, but again and again it continues to knot up, not even an inch in.	negative
JUNK!! 3 months old, rarely used (pool guy uses his own) and already torn in 3 or 4 spots. Wish I could give 0 stars and 5 red X's.	negative
Would not support my size kept having to readjust	negative
I was sent a pair that was broken, asked for an exchange. They wanted me to cut my wires before sending me new ones, I had to convince them that driving st night without headlight 's is illegal. I finally got my replacement bulbs and they were used! They have rust on them and electrical lube. Filing a complaint with Amazon.	negative
I don’t believe the hype. Feel no benefits after taking these . Let’s see how this money back guarantee works ??	negative
I love these brushes. They are the most heavy or super luxurious but they get the job done and especially for the price !! I do love these they are super soft !	positive
A bit heavy but works well.	positive
Wasn’t what I was thinking. You can hardly see the name.	negative
Material felt strange and stiff, not comfortable.	negative
Its cute but kind of hurts to remove from ur hair	positive
It has a whole in the shorts area	negative
good quality, price was right.	positive
I love the concept and all the bright sparkly swirly colors This brand offers. But for me personally it was too clunky I'm used to more flexibility in the soul	positive
The horses are Breyer, so you know the models are going to be nice. I am a huge fan of Cloud and have seen all the documentaries. The markings on the horses match the real horses perfectly. The low rating is because the Breyer box came completely destroyed. Smashed. The shipping box was fine and it had packing material so it appears to have been like this before shipping. The horses inside aren't broken but this was extremely disappointing. I'm just glad I didn't buy this to give as a gift.	negative
Picks up signal from other apartments.	negative
Great quality inserts for an A5 travelers notebook. I have used my fountain pens and markers with no bleed through. Very highly recommend it for those who have a wide or an A5 travelers notebook.	positive
completely ineffective.	negative
Though I-Phone 8 Plus fit, the quality of the material was not good nor what I expected. The strap color is different shade of pink and overall was not satisfied with the wallet case.	negative
I bought this based on the referral of a social media guru but honestly it’s a little watery for me and I typically add some of my vitamin C serum just to make it a little thicker and prevent that white pasty look. I wouldn’t recommend	negative
Stopped working after a week turns itself off without heating. We’ll see what breville customer service says on Monday	negative
Great stuff. Not cheap but better than soda.	positive
Not terribly happy with this bees wax. It feels diluted, and is MUCH more translucent that what the pictures showed. There is still the smell of real bees wax, but it is VERY diluted. The flexibility is there, but I'm hesitant to use it for the things that I've traditionally used real bees wax for in the past. I do NOT recommend this. Might be okay for candles, but it is definitely NOT 100% real.	negative
Love these jeans. Fit great and very comfortable.	positive
Item arrived damaged with dents.	negative
I never got it! Waiting for 2 months now!	negative
Very heavy duty webbing.	positive
I am not happy with my order because twice now the wrong product was shipped. I kept the first wrong one and reordered. Then got the wrong order AGAIN! I am ordering Hazelnut Coffee and keep getting Medium Roast coffee.	negative
Popped off after a few days. There's only a thin strip of glue around the rim so it doesn't stay on for long.	negative
knockoff Otterbox. The home button is hard to press for a 5S. outer shell is great, the hard plastic shell is cheap and flimsy.	negative
I had mistakenly ordered the Logitec case for my iPad Pro, but it didn't fit. It was about 150.00. This feels and functions just as well for a fraction of the cost. My first keyboard had damage to the space right key on the lower right corner of the keyboard. I messaged the seller and they sent me a new keyboard next day. I love this product and my iPad feels totally safe and secure locked within.	positive
These are good! Very flavorful. Quite small but better than the ones ive had in restaurants.	positive
Nice looking but did not fit my iPhone 8plus	negative
Just not pleased it wobbles in plastic handle. Feels cheap yet steel if good and sharpens very well.	positive
one of the cleanest and decent taste proteins out there..	positive
Awesome Buzz! Grandson loved it!	positive
I wish they made it bit thicker the steel beams.	positive
I'm writing this with the Cooper touchpad. It took a little while to setup but I finally got it to connect by entering 0000 on both the keyboard and in windows 10 prompt. It is nice to have the built in mouse. The case is quite nice and looks like it will hold up for a long time.	positive
The camera is a great narrator - always showing you what you are meant to see, and keeping hidden what should remain hidden. It creates a mesmerizing watching experience, which backs up and sells a somewhat silly premise.	positive
It's not comfortable at all the heel hurt my foot I can't wear it all day	negative
These earrings are very very cute and super light weight. However, the post are SOOO sharp. I have an infant who loves grabbing at my ears so I can’t wear these as often as I’d like. He would definitely hurt himself	positive
The handle in one of them came broken.	negative
Was cake and difficult to remove from hair... I threw it out!!	negative
Felt a little sticky after application.	positive
only drawback is that the front and back patters don't meet up, but that's a minor gripe. For the price it's pretty cool.	positive
A convenient and compact wine rack that fits into a fairly standard condo kitchen closet	positive

Cute ring as accessory	positive
so many tools all in a small easy to use product. very fast service. thank You	positive
Worked about 30 seconds,, then blowed fuse, won't work at all	negative
I have bought 3 copies as gifts. The recipes are absolutely delicious and very inexpensive. Perfect gift for those who are on a tight budget, but enjoy cooking tasty food.	positive
Been using this for months, no issues. I felt like i was taking a chance after reading some of the reviews but it’s been great. Expensive in my opinion but still dont regret buying at all. Would recommend to a anyone looking for a good ultrawide.	positive
"The zipper is on a relatively loose ""track"" so it frequently unzipped during wear."	negative
Great fit, comfortable and pretty colors	positive
I'm rating this for the customer service, do not get me wrong the holster is great. When you and others try and ask for a left handed holster and get ridiculous replies or no replies from the company it's upsetting. I will not be buying any of these products again.	negative
This hitch is a fast and easy install however this hitch seems like it is designed for a lighter trailer than mine. I drove 600 miles with it and the whole trip the hitch flexes pushing the truck forward and backward the whole trip very irritating.	negative
I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It has a nice, light scent and went on smoothly. After a day of using it, my arms started itching. At first I thought it might be a bug bite. The next day I woke up with an angry red rash everywhere I had applied this sunscreen. It took several days for the rash to clear up.	negative
FYI, the stardust white has a confetti print on it. I thought it was just white :(	positive
These are our go-to burp cloths. They seem to actually absorb spit-up and not get completely soaked/soiled in the process. Also a very good size for burping. Not too small nor too large.	positive
First of all, I really like the beanie! Wore it twice, washed it, and the stitching has already came apart :( I washed it with two tshirts, so it wasnt the laundry that caused it. Sad, because I really like this beanie and have another one in orange! Now I am scared to wash it for fear it will get ruined. :(	negative
The over all construction of this light is light weight. The biggest problem was when it first came on it would cycle on and off for about 10 minutes.	negative
Not rose gold very disappointed	negative
Haven’t been able to use it yet, came out of the package badly warped (won’t stay flat on the counter)	negative
My knew best friend!	positive
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks!	positive
Very nice sandal, great construction, comfortable	positive
Words cannot describe my wife’s satisfaction with this gift, I am a wonderful man.	positive
It doesn’t work. I returned it.	negative
I bought this thinking it would last at least a couple years. Not even 6 months use and totally gone. Busted 3 -4 feet from the nozzle. Very disappointed in this product	negative
I really like this case! I actually bought two! Very nice & durable feels like it will protect my phone! Also comes with a screen protector so pretty cool!	positive
My two dogs will no longer eat their food since I mixed this product in it. The product smells awful too. No returns allowed either. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy this, your wallet and dogs will thank you.	negative
I've enjoyed the planner, it is customizable for dates and times but otherwise you follow a pretty structured system, which is helpful. The questions in the beginning felt a bit repetitive, but to their credit they got me thinking. The weekly and daily goal review is a great motivator.	positive
This works but doesn't spray hard enough for me. So don't use.	negative
Started using this when my son was having difficulty waking many times through the night. Definitely lessened the wake ups and he loves the flavor	positive
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I never received the product and was still charged.	negative
Very comfortable easy to put on easy to adjust and stays in place no more sliding glasses.	positive
"A great substitute for Grecian Formula. Considerably less expensive, more liquid in each bottle, and as easy (and effective) to use as the ""old"" Grecian Formula. I am definitely ""hooked"". Have been using it for the past month and the results are exactly what I found years ago with Grecian Formula. It is a great product."	positive
I do not like them, tried them two times and won't use them again. the material is scratchy, not comfortable. It is hot wearing them. I could see them for outdoor cold weather use and over other sleeves. Or maybe in a cooler.	negative
Better than original.	positive
Never received my product but my money was taken	negative
Got a great deal on this but didn't come with the signal booster and works just as good as my old school rabbit ears.	negative
Cheaper than Walmart thank you	positive
I bought this for my gf who vegetarian and has low iron levels. We have only made teas with it so far and thats worked out fine. The first time we used it, the fish rusted up a little but that came out easy by scrubbing lime juice over it.	positive
It's not bulky. You can fit mason jars in the other compartment side. The handle makes it perfect to sit out on the table for a buffet style dinner. I'm considering getting another one for my bedroom to organize my vanity.	positive
I am not sure why this is called an autobiography. What it does offer is a brief commentary by the artist for each painting. But the book is large enough for good-size reproductions and they seem to be of good quality. There are all in color and there are enough paintings included to have a sufficient overview of his best work. It is great to have a fine sampling of Wyeth without the bulk of a heavy, coffee-table sized volume.	positive
I’d give it 0 stars if I could. Arrived well past expected date - by WEEKS- too late for my daughter’s birthday. Popped almost immediately. Save yourself the hassle - don’t waste your money.	negative
Not totally self repairing.	positive
This charger worked fine for about a week (I used it about 3 times in the car for short trips). After using it for about 3 times, it just completely stopped working. I was so disappointed, since I really need one of these to charge my phone in the car. I would not recommend this, as it only lasted for about 3 charges and stopped working.	negative
My husband has large arms. So bands are a bit snug	positive
I wanted a 4k camcorder and was quite excited when this camcorder arrived. Very soon, I turned it on and I found that it had the same video quality as the digital camera I own a decade ago. Very disappointed. Its video quality is absolutely not 4k or even not HD. The camcorder itself feels very cheap. Do not waste your time and money to buy it and return it later.	negative
Don't know what this is for... Bought it for mistake i guess	negative
Love it, go and buy now	positive
Map format is meager and poorly laid out. Backlight intensity range limited.	negative
"I like it. I love the thumb holes. The sleeves stay down & keep my hands very warm. The only thing I didn't like was the length. The longest point comes 2 or 3 inches below my knee. I am 5'4"" and I could wear this as a dress."	positive
our shih tzu used the toy for 1 hour and we almost lost it after that - the sound this thing made was beyond annoying! Wish I could turn off sound and leave vibrations for our dog to continue to play with it. We ended up taking the speaker/vibration out and she loved it... for a week. She's 9 lbs and tore the threading and fur off pretty quickly.	negative
Found this product missleading. Thought it was framed. It was not clear that the product was just a flat poster.	negative
comfortable and elegant	positive
Another good product	positive
It provides a good view of the blind spot, just perfect for me.	positive
Does get very hot. Takes a really long time to even get warm. So because it doesn’t get hot, the curls don’t stay in :(	negative
Very happy with my new air fryer. I had wanted one of these for years and finally got the chance to find this really good one, here on Amazon. I can cook up French fries, make mozzarella sticks, I can even dehydrate meat for my husband and all kinds of other recipes simple and easy. It came with a recipe book and all the parts that I needed to have a really good air frying experience. It cleans up nice too. Very satisfied with my purchase.	positive
Then poles were great, they came with no damage, and they were the correct length. Only issue was that the ending poles were not specified, they were not correct, couldn’t fit the poles around the tent peice.	positive
It wasn't the same size as pictured. They are not sticking to wall they started falling off the next day. Dont buy!	negative
Nice case but here’s the down side. I’ve only had it a few weeks and all four corners are getting very dirty on the pale pink rubberized part on the front. I bought one for my daughter also and she has the same issue.	negative
Good value compared to other products.	positive
Cheap, doesn't even make you sweat it's like a tight gym shirt!!	negative
Absolutely Beautiful	positive
Product was 100% what I expected.	positive
This products sucks made me bleed and leaves it very patchy and super irritated. Would not recommend this! It does leave your skin soft though and the irritation is gone by the next day but definitely not worth the pain	negative
beautiful scenery and appreciated learning more about parks. I love the challenges.	positive
Very cute ans perfect for baby shower foods.	positive
My dog destroyed this toy in 3 days of non heavy use he is a 60 lbs dog.	negative
Nice. Runs a bit smaller than I thought. All in all great jacket for price!	positive
Got these in today and the suction cups are so deformed that they will not attach anywhere on my windows. Also the big one is huge. I did not realize it was for the front or rear window. The pictures on the ad are deceiving. It shows one of the smaller shades. I went to return it and it's going to cost me seven dollars to return them when it was a $12 item which is absurd!!!! Not a Happy Momma!!	negative
Wrong product sent from warehouse. Size of a post it note. Would not recommend.	negative
It loses shape quickly. I regret buying this.	negative
This will do the trick bit is not easily adjustable. My 2 kids are need to be able to adjust a stool without unscrewing and moving bolts. It's also not the best quality. We returned it.	negative
Performed as expected, will buy again.	positive
A very nice calendar	positive
This thing is great. Living at the beach and having this that takes up little storage space, is easy and comfy to use. Super simple. Love it. Even used it in the back yard!	positive
I could not receive a single channel with this, I live in town and cant get one channel	negative
I ordered 2 pair. One for me and one for my best friend. We put them on at the same time. Right away I was uncomfortable and felt like my legs had no air. An hour after putting them on I got a hole in the crotch area. 2 hours later my friend got a hole in the same are. Save your money.	negative
Best chocolate product that can be enjoyed on the keto diet. Satisfies my chocolate cravings and doesn’t inhibit weight loss.	positive
Was not happy....screen had scratches on the corner and also did not fully stick to my nav unit. Returning to seller.	negative
Since we are using them on Christmas Eve, I wish they had a decorative design.	positive
Didnt work with my phone and they would answer so i could get a refund	negative
Ordered these to replace one that went out not long after use, but they are good esc just had one faulty one in previous order.	positive
The instructions were printed so small I could barely read them with a magnifying glass. The screen has a black background with blue directions that I could not read. Nice size though that I liked. but it's useless if I can't operate it. Why can't someone make simple recorder that just records, plays and deletes. No frills.	negative
Sturdy, sleek design, a lower profile.. Very nice.	positive
Handsome looking case. Seems durable and well made. All the cut-outs are in the right places. Price was right	positive
I used this to replace an air filled mattress on my sleeper sofa that leaked. The new mattress fit inside the old cover and was used by my son when he was here for a visit. He is 6' tall and over 200 pounds and found the mattress very acceptable for a sleeper sofa mattress.	positive
please remove from my order history! if you were paid for this from my PRIME Account....i want a refund!	negative
Smells wonderful!! Lasts for hours.	positive
It was great about the polarization, I have a wider temple( my fault I did not check the measurements prior to ordering)	positive
I was impressed with how quickly it got here, but it smells terrible! It smells like alcohol mixed with perfume.	negative
They were a gift and the group gave a wow, great presentation and wonderful product	positive
Great quality so far. makes delicious whipped cream!	positive
Bought these a few times and never last more than a few months	negative
Extremely cheap and flimsy! Plastic cracked as soon as I took it out of box. Looks like a cheap kids party prop, not good for a theater room!	negative
Fits my 9ft tree perfectly. Bag is very good quality.	positive
Received as described	positive
Items were not delivered. US Postal said boxes too heavy. Why do you use USPS? Why do they accept your shipments?	negative
Came broken with half of the product spilled out. Padding seemed adequate but somehow it still came broken almost as if it was originally shipped that way.	negative
Very slim. Very well constructed. Good leather. I've only been using it for a week or so, but so far so good.	positive
Poignantly beautiful.	positive
My son asked for this shirt for Christmas, but the letters faded the first time I washed it, and I washed it on cold water!	negative
I love the color and how cold it keeps me drink. The included removable handle is great! BUT I’ve only had it a month and a half and look what happened after one time in the dishwasher. (Says it is dishwasher safe) I usually hand wash it but left it in the sink and my teenager was loading the dishwasher so in it went! I’m past the return date so stuck with it.	negative
The individual packaging packets is huge compared to a tiny bag of tea inside. I don't feel I got big enough single serving.	negative
The item did not work,. Used it the way the instructions said but did not help with the mosquitos or gnats.	negative
My 5lb picky Yorkie will eat it, so what more can I say.	positive
Easy to use and cleaning is easy as well.	positive
It works and looks great. :)	positive
I wish it were a bit larger.	positive
Very uncomfortable, inconvenient to put on, way overpriced for a piece of plastic. I had to buy a different type of cup. I wish I could return it.	negative
The CD was in good condition and the soundtrack was the correct one, plays well, but the came in broken which is disappointing.	negative
The flash on this thing DOES NOT work. Very frustrating. This was a gift. I don't like giving broken gifts. Please get back to me on this	negative
The rifle case was good quality and the company was easy to work with	positive
Has loose red threads coming out of the stitching, not safe for baby!	negative
This toy definately has got everything I need. It has sucking, vibration, no need for battery ( which also annoying, because they are not cheap). I like magnetic charging, it so easy and convenient. Vibration power is adjustable. Works great for mr. Thank you!	positive
Love the tumbler but the hot lid cracked within a week.. from? Hot tea? I have no idea. I would have given 5 stars except that. But it keeps things hot and cold and the lid doesn’t leak....yet.	positive
I want to love this product because it’s natural and I had high hopes but unfortunately it does not stay on very long and it will run and smudge with any sort of humidity or sweat. Definitely a no-no for summer! I hope they’ll figure out a better solution because I really do appreciate their aspiration for this product!	negative
Great material; thick but stretchy. The length is great if your short; there’s not a bunch of leftover fabric at your ankles. The waist is high and thick. The only issue is that the fabric is a little see through when it gets stretched.	positive
This thing is AMAZING! I can't wait til we can really use it once we move into our house with a movie room!	positive
Two male pins were misaligned to fit with female body. One was loose. Able to get it to work, to save the hassle of returning it, though time will see how well made this product is and how long it will last..	negative
Waited and waited while kept getting notices from Amazon for these to come. Finally after saying they would be here last nite I got a notice saying they were sent back due to damage. I have received others from same company that are fine so will try again. Things happen.	negative
Seems to work well. Now my slide on shoes smell much better.	positive
Didn’t read closely I was looking for the hardcover set	negative
I like having a variety of fidgets for my students. This set has a nice variety for them to choose from. The quality of these products is good and makes me feel like they will last awhile. Not like some of the cheaper made things out there.	positive
Beautiful rug. Very soft.	positive
Quality balls, good price	positive
Very very small.. thought they were bigger. Would not have ordered them if I knew they were matchbox size.	negative
Good product. Heavy duty. Rather large on desk top.	positive
The shampoo is too clarifying. Not as good at regular micellar water.	negative
Exactly what I was looking for. Holds all my bottles perfectly without banging around	positive
you cannot put anything large in it. put small plants or vines.	negative
This was the worst order I have ever purchased with Amazon. I bought it for my grandson as I am his care giver for his parents to work. The motor never worked properly. It finally died a few days after the purchase. I am not trying to sound like a negative ole lady, but I am being honest that this was a terrible product. My family has had better luck with theirs than I.	negative
Everything perfect. Just fits a bit snug, my daughter is 3 1/2 and I honestly think one more month and it wouldn't fit. I ordered a 3/4, thinking I should of ordered a 4/5. But other than that, it's perfect.	positive
Not great choice for rv little too cheap	positive
I have followed the instructions on how to make the milk foamy but it is lackluster at best. Not worth the purchase	negative
Love this! I cut 4 zucchinis in to slices in just seconds.... Can't wait to try it on other veggies.	positive
This item came cracked.	negative
Bear was alittle too big. The description of product didn't have size of cutters.	negative
When I first got the utensils I was happy with them. However, within less than a month some of them started to break.	negative
Mine just arrived today. It would be perfect, except it is missing a piece of the zipper in the inside. Very important, as zipper problems are very annoying and time consuming, as anyone knows. Disappointed.	negative
I was happy with this unit for nine months, which is how long it lasted. Until it failed, it offered nice performance with a well-designed remote for an excellent price. Now I know why it was so cheap.	negative
These are pricey but the pup loves them. I even sometimes spread a little canned food inside after he eats out the salmon. I mainly use them on Bridge days when my naughty schnoodle boy needs a diversion. Highly recommended if you need a doggie pacifier.	positive
These are really pretty and light weight. The color is very pretty. The packs included are more than enough. I was able to complete a regular size head with a little over 3 packs, it gives it a more natural look. The twists are really small. If you use all 8 packs the head might look like a wet mop and very unnatural. This will be better if it has suggested installation techniques. But overall is worth it.	positive
It is a quality product that is easy to use.	positive
This mat is excellent! I've been practicing for 30 years but hubby is new to yoga and I wanted him to get a strong start. He loves his new mat!	positive
Had these batteries for a while but they have never lasted very long at all. They come in handy as good backups but I expect they will die after an hour or so	negative
Just the same as sold in Office Depot only half the price for EXACT same package.	positive
This is a very clean and nice tripod its light weight and easy to set up in just seconds. Great for those instant shots. For a small tripod it extends out pretty tall and looks good with the red tone.	positive
The batteries last forever! Great for a smaller space. Great sound. I purchased two, so I can put one in the living room, and one in the kitchen.	positive
Don't waste your money. If I wasn't giving this to my daughter for Christmas I would absolutely return it. I ordered the owlette doll which was double the price of other pj mask dolls. It's tiny and not even close to worth what I paid. Extremely disappointed.	negative
"My knife cut through the ""leather"" right away. And it's not even a very sharp knife. I guess it's only $12 down the drain... and I'm still going to use it after I duct-tape patch it up so i dont cut myself. But definitely would like some sort of replacement if this was just a defective item. It certainly looks really cool and I like the design. But in reality what I recieved failed immediately out the box."	negative
Poor quality does not sharpen pencils very well!	negative
I used this along with the Biotin shampoo and my hair did not feel soft after each shower.	negative
It was the best purchase ever. Complete with everything ready for installation. No more buying water!!	positive
Nice, warm, just what I needed for texting!!	negative
Came broken. Shipping was so fast and packaging looks great! So I was surprised to open the box and right away spot the broken product. Total bummer as my daughter was really looking forward to using this for her rabbits.	negative
OMG. I couldn't get enough of this book. I just loved it. She's a new author to me but she sure won't be now. Can't wait for the next book. So well written & so hot. Thanks.	positive
I bought this in July. I had our apartment manager install to replace the basic shower head that was there. By October the face of this showerhead started falling off, but it was easy enough to snap back on. It is now December and the showerhead came apart completely and is not functional	negative
I thought these would be bigger and float. They do not. They sink like a rock.	negative
Very stiff. It wasn’t comfortable as I was deadlifting. Do not recommend.	negative
These bath bombs are so nice! they feel great & the scents are fantastic!!! Its like a little vacation away from the world, if only for a few minutes!! I will be getting these for my sisters for Christmas. I love them!	positive
Less than a month of use,running 6 hours a day and it has crapped out. Edit: After much running around and dealing with Intex support the replacement has arrived and seems to be working. The problem the support person said was that I used an extension cord and had burned up the motor on the pump. Thing is the motor would run fine for 2 minutes then shut off.	negative
unable to change the colors after 6 months. not recommended. I am happy to update my review after I contact the customer support to see what my options are. Edit: contacted ustellar for replacement. They gladly approved and told me they would ship me 2 new units in 15 days. After 30 days of no sign of shipment I contacted them and they told me these are out of stock. Still trying to figure out a solution. I will update this review again. So far terrible experience.	negative
Worked great the first few times I have used it. My little guy is 8 weeks old now and both pumps have holes in the bottom like it’s splitting at the seam. It now doesn’t hold any milk. I’ve only used them a total of 10 times..	negative
Isn’t picking up from about 125 ft.	negative
The item came in a box that was much too large with no packing material so the box was pretty beat up. Thankfully none of the wood pieces were broken. Per the instructions in the box there were supposed to be a number of additional pieces (screws, a handle, pieces to attach the shelves with) but only the wood pieces were in the box. How are we supposed to assemble it if pieces are missing?	negative
I excepted better quality for the price. I kept it but I do not recommend it.	negative
Didnt realize it was a silicone, i ordered the blue one and when i got it its a lighter color. The plastic seems thin/very breakable. And the phone stand doesnt work on mine. I will say the extra clip they give you feels more sturdy. Would not buy again because i was looking for a more durable phone case.	negative
I thought the one I ordered was water proof? Did something go wrong or what? This item says nothing about being water proof.	negative
Fast and easy to use	positive
Very hard to remove the key	negative
Arrived broken. Not happy.	negative
The price is very favorable and the quality is good.i like it	positive
It was easy to replace the OEM unit with this display. It would be a 5 star review if the display were a little brighter. Much better than a mostly dead OEM unit but it is not easily readable when the sun is out. Distracting.	positive
The set is perfect. I like it contains 4 items and it’s very convenient in use	positive
The reception is weak, cannot get many channels.	negative
These have plenty of room for your pillows	positive
Easy to install & are nice quality too for the price.	positive
I received a iPad instead of the Mac Book	negative
This does the job as far as tightening you up. The problem is the thing part. It’s too thick making it uncomfortable and impossible to wear for more than an hour	negative
They are cute and all but they are always falling off. Other than that they serve their purpose because my kids like to drag the chair across a tile floor to make as much noise as they can. Purpose served .	positive
They wouldn't work on any cabinet in my house.	negative
This is an excellent drone. I bought it as a gift to my 20 year old son and he loves it. He is really happy with it, and tells everybody to buy this drone.	positive
They where great but after the 5 charge it stop holding charge	negative
Very hard to keep synced to my device and the left earbud failed after the second day.	negative
It is very affordable and comfortable couch. Problem is that there is tear at the bottom corner which I did not notice at first	negative
Excellent products I’m pleased with this order it came as described. I have been using it for more than a week with less care and they still look like I just got it. I’ll be buying this for an upcoming house warming.	positive
Easy to use for forehead or tympanic thermometer. Have only used once so I can't comment on durability as of yet, but I'm pleased with performance so far.	positive
I usually am borderline between medium and large but when the reviews said to order a size up, I got the XL just in case. I couldn’t even pull the skirt up over my thighs... I had to give the skirt to my mom who is usually maybe a size 4 at the most. The inside of the skirt said XL size 8 and it fits her well. I gave it two stars because it’s still cute.	negative
I rented this out of curiosity because we’ve all heard the story. The actress from the sitcom mom plays her mother I think.. too many F bombs but otherwise entertaining.	positive
So disappointed in this movie! It had incredible potential. Just awful.	negative
Just that the colors it shows are not accurately depicted once in person. Had to send back	negative
My daughter lost her capo so we opted to to get her this one. Unfortunately it does not work as well as the last one. It is a bit bulkier and does not sit as snuggly on the neck and strings as I think it should. Although it does work, maybe it just doesn’t fit all ukuleles. Either way, I don’t recommend this product.	negative
The wedge height was good. You are able too sleep on your back or side. Only thing that would be better is if it would fold down and be more compact for traveling.	positive
Poor quality, or I got a lemon. The white bungee strap snapped when I tried to install it. Still works without the strap since the skirt itself has elastic in it to hold it up, just not as tight around the mattress.	negative
Very disappointed in these watering spikes, particularly since I searched and searched for what I thought would be the best product. Out of 12, only one worked at all.	negative
It was fine up until now. Now it will only charge if the phone is sitting horizontally. Poor execution	negative
I liked this product at first. About halfway through the first season the main pressure screw cracked an was left unable to be used as intended. Cheap plastic on what was obviously a key part that was going to be needing to be durable. I despise when manufacturers just dont care.	negative
I've read the manual, watched YouTube videos, and still i can't seem to get the alarm part to sound. Everything else works fine except this and the voice control part. Very dissatisfied :(	negative
Didn’t last very long	negative
great product works as advertised	positive
I was looking for something lighter and more durable and this product does just that. The rope that is included was helpful when carry the boxes downstairs so they don't fall. Also the top part handle is adjustable so you can make it shorter or longer when carrying more stuff.	positive
Was diffidently not for a 42mm Apple Watch these screen protector was too small !	negative
I felt a difference in my skin within one week! I mistakenly ordered a different brand on month two, and I can feel the difference. Definitely sticking with this company.	positive
The best snack ever...hope it keeps the waist line down	positive
Very pretty and it's the perfect size for a cake!	positive
Fell apart after one use! Used two out of the three Called manufacturer	negative
Nicely done indie. Loads of good acting and the storyline is great as well. Do as they suggest, and watch in the dark. It enhances the effect.	positive
I am underwhelmed. Despite pre-heating the carafe with hot water the best I get for warm coffee is 1-2 hrs....AT BEST And still need to put in the microwave. The lid and handle are plastic which came as a surprise. I have some time to make a decision to return but that is most likely the move I will make.	negative
After about 4 weeks it stopped frothing although it does heat the milk. I am unable to return to amazon.com so had to reorder another brand. Don't waste your money. No refunds!!	negative
Arrived leaky... and tasted horrible	negative
Great for length and volume, dries out quickly!	positive
The snake looks good but the size is probably too much for most of the ears. It presses against the ear so it is not comfortable. Can't bear wearing it for a while.	negative
Great boat for the price. If you are looking to try out a boat, I'd give this one a try. It does favor one side a lot, but you can trim it to make up for it. I didn't find it to be that fast on windy days on a lake, but may be it's faster on a calmer day.	positive
Dissappointed in the quality	negative
"Purchased this product thinking the quality would be great but it constantly jams despite the ""no-jam"" claim in the title. I don't staple every day but staple often and the hassle is very inconvenient. Double staples are constantly released and causes jams. The only great thing is that this came with a staple remover which helps un-jam the staples!"	negative
This hand held massager is so nice. Love all the attachments great battery life and like all the different attachments holds a great charge used for some muscle pain and went away great massager	positive
Very very pretty. My husband bought it for me for Christmas. Did not come with any oil though.	positive
Not organic as described	negative
Where was this item delivered? I never received it!	negative
I think the description is misleading. It states 70 count (pack of 3), but only 1 bottle came. Not the good deal I thought it was.	negative
Very cute phone case but it doesn’t fit my phone correctly on the bottom. It’s like the case is warped weird and doesn’t protect the bottom corners. Wouldn’t buy again.	negative
Love this product great paranormal suspense book with amazing depth. Love the characters, the storyline highs and lows how it always keeps you wanting to know what's coming next! I would've given a full five stars if had been a series book that that went on to tell the story of other characters in more books as I want to know them however what I did get was an unexpected gripping can't be put down story!	positive
It does exactly what I wanted like a deep tissue massage... Very happy 5 Stars....	positive
Received this as a Christmas gift , BUT just opened it to use today. There are no attachments to connect to the float. I could not use it. Very disappointing as the other folks in my family who received the gift loved it. Would appreciate the attatchments mailed to me, or the machine replaced.	negative
Looks good but like every other third break light I’ve put on will need sealed around it but that’s to be expected	positive
Updated review: I reordered this item, received a good one. Cat enjoyed it, did gain weight. This product does cause diarrhea. Weigh the risks with your vet. Maybe try adding pumpkin for fiber? YMMV. Item arrived without a lid and leaking all over the other items in my shipment. Having been unsealed and in the heat for at least two days, it's unusable and unsafe to feed my cat.	positive
Received my order quickly! Good deal on this order! Always glad to save money. Thanks again for your great service!	positive
Bought it for 2016 Ford Explorer..Very high quality seat covers. Didn't rip during installation. Had to adjust certain spots and cut holes for headrest. Took a lot of time (1.5 hrs) to install but overall it was worth it. Quality feels like it should last awhile.	positive
It really works! My plants love it . Buy it	positive
A nice wallet but I'm disappointed in the color. It's pictured as light brown -- a color that seems new and different -- but instead it's dark brown.	positive
tricked my kid into ordering	negative
They play good for the price. Easy to install.	positive
I didn't, like that the white is very dingy .	negative
better for women than man	positive
Great book for new Core Leaders, like me.	positive
Love this opener. So much easier to use that a regular wine opener. I would recommend this item.	positive
On my first trip with these and they are already starting to come apart. I wanted to try these instead of the plastic vacuum bags that I normally use because I don't like my clothes smelling like plastic. So far not good. Will update when I get off of my month long backpack trip.	negative
Good quality product and Awesome price!	positive
Had to contact the mfg for confirmation of correct part, online information inadequate and product instruction poor.	positive
I will start with saying that the functionality of this product work very well. But, functionality means nothing if the camera itself can't stay together. I live in a very warm area in California, and one 100 degree day the viewing screen literally melted apart, along with the internal components swelling. This product is made to be inside a vehicle, and it should be made to withstand the environments that go with it.	negative
While it was interesting to learn about nutrition, this book had a lot of contradictory information in it that didn't match up to other medical texts I've studied. Just be careful and always use more than one resource, especially when it comes to diabetes and hypertension care.	negative
This kit is extremely cheap, and components have broken during initial uses. The tire chuck broke during the first use and just leaks air. The air hose is cheap plastic and not what was expected.	negative
It's very light weight and sets my bars to the perfect length for down hill, very sturdy feel to it and fits perfectly to my bike, great product.	positive
Not a fan of this bag. There are much better bags out there. Does not seal well if you only have one pizza in it.	negative
Good quality and well made, however I ordered a size 10-12 and received a 5xl. Quite disappointed because I could not return it having had it brought to my vacation island. Sigh	negative
Good quality and fit. Not overly bulky but has Durability enough for an 8 yr old boy. I would purchase again,especially if it was at a reduced special price like the one I purchased. WHAT A DEAL!	positive
absolutely does not work.	negative
Great addition to my kit!	positive
My friend said this was the best eye glass cleaner. I loved that it has it's own case and is light to carry. But I don't see that it cleans my glasses so well. I bought one for my husband and he felt the same way. Too bad, good idea.	negative
Assumed because I bought a set of 24 I would get 24. Put the box on my work bench till next oil change and come to find out only had 16 in the box. Open and check your order when you get it.	negative
I use this every night and sleep so much better without ambient night light from all the electronics in the bedroom and the street lights. Best part is, there's no velcro to scratch my bald head.	positive
Full of good information. Much of it is common sense and some training methods that are tried and true. It's hard to follow ALL of the tips for training and not feel as if you are doing nothing else but puppy training and sleeping. However I did find the book helpful and I return to it often for a refresher.	positive
I find it helps to regulate me. I don't have much pain so i really can't say	positive
Not the best. I prefer the liquid from Trader Joes. It still works for my tea, but true to the powders, they do have an after taste.	positive
It is very heavy duty. I read a lot of reviews and finally chose the company's products. The color of this product is very bright. It can be written on it. I used this prize wheel in my class. My students like it very much. This product attracted their attention completely. I think I will recommend this product to other teachers who need it.	positive
Basically a kitchen slicing knife, for the money can't go wrong.	positive
Wish side pads were better. They hurt after a while.	positive
I just wished it had a small stand than it would have gotten 5 stars	positive
These are great! They even curl. I have had them for 2 months on and they hold on pretty well. They look natural. They curl well with the curling iron. When I go to the hair salon the hair stylist ask me where I bought it as they look just like my hair and hold style well. I took them off once. They were easy to take off and re tape.	positive
The picture was very deceiving. This necklace did not wrap around my neck at all. Very disappointed. I guess the old saying is true you get what you pay for.	negative
It did not fit my cell phone.	negative
Even with fresh, good batteries, the lid only works for a day. The power cord is really a requirement, which is probably why it costs about $20. The manufacturer should just be honest and include the power cord in the cost of the trash can.	negative
Very disappointed in this product. I thought it would be great because you could adjust the firmness by they amount of air you put in. I was wrong. The seams left me with cuts and scratches on my legs. Not good when your trying to recover from surgery. I returned it and ordered a standard leg pillow.	negative
Bought 2, both leak from the same spot, dead center where there appears to be a defect in the mold! Little hole the size of a toothpick in each dish. Couldn't see it at first, filled them then came home to a big puddle several hrs later! Checked the 2nd one and sure enough sane hole, same spot. Don't buy!	negative
I like the thin material, which means no heavy stuff in there, but I was surprised at how it leaks at the seams. So it’s a handy set of bags, but they won’t keep your stuff dry.	negative
It has worked great for my kids and their lap tops, I would buy again.	positive
most comfortable shoes I've had in a decade! love it!!!!	positive
Great material, nice size, fits my MacBook Air and my iPad	positive
Product delivered promptly. Excellent product, Always had troubles with chargers but this one is the perfect length and also very durable unlike many i've previously brought! Highly recommended product. Works great with ipads and iphones, Strong and sturdy. Good quality for the price. Very good quality cable extra long length.	positive
Bought a six pack of this hot sauce because it is a favorite in our house, but it is hard to find in stores. When it arrived, the bottles were shattered because there was ZERO packing material. I can’t fathom why someone would just throw glass bottles in a box and not expect them to break in transit. Amazon was wonderful and issued a full refund immediately, but the product is now sold out.	negative
Long gauntlet. Well made. Nice materials. Fit well. Not stiff. Comfortable to wear. Great color -adds a little panache while pruning. Definitely, would recommend these gloves!	positive
Simple interface, great price, does the job.	positive
This torch lighter did not want to work when it arrived after many attempts of adding fuel and adjusting the flame control it started to work as it should. about 3 months later the flame control no longer worked and it is at maximum all the time. Turning the adjustment for the flame control does nothing. It is a very inexpensive torch lighter. I would not recommend it to others.	negative
I Really Like This Alot & Would Recommend To Anyone Who Is In Need Of A Sleep Aid!!!!!	positive
I'm a 36 DD and purchased a Large/XL. I can't usually wear these types of bras but I'm glad I bought this one. It's comfortable fits well and looks really cute under my cut out t-shirts.	positive
Great quality, difficult to order size. Ran large	positive
Works better than a lot of the cheap versions you can purchase in stores for the same price. Plastic and metal used are of good quality. Was delivered about 2 or 3 weeks after I ordered but it was delivered.	positive
As pictured, but very large on a slim face. I also don't care too much for the straight design. They don't wrap around the face- not even a little. But, I did keep them bc they are still really cute.	positive
Failed after 2 months	negative
I like the Protective housing but I believe it should have a gasket around the two connecting parts.	positive
A great purchase. It only took minutes to complete the installation. It’s small enough to use in any room you prefer. You can slow walk or run with the many different programs. A perfect way to exercise for me as a senior.	positive
Might want to buy a size smaller than your shoe. There's just a little room at the toe.	positive
This wash I tape was not useable because it was more like string than tape.	negative
I tried to file a claim over the phone. I had already emailed the docs but but the representative told me to email in different documentation again. Afterwards, it was radio silence. The coverage was the same as if I'd paid for the replacement parts myself. They made it as difficult as possible to file a claim. I got an email this morning stating that these crooks lost a class action and I am eligible for a full refund when the case is concluded. Don't fall for this scam!	negative
Works fine customer satisfied.	positive
They hang just barely over the feet of 2 arm chairs and the couch. All 3 don't move at all even if one of our kids is jumping on the couch.	positive
I want to buy a black tracker for my husband and this one got my attention. It can track heart beats, steps, calories burned, miles walked. The wrist band is soft and comfortable. The watch is easy to set up and use, display is bright and clear, it is a good buy!	positive
Great, but has a short range.	positive
Good product. Needs more internal (padded) space for mouthpiece storage. Not big enough.	positive
The light is no where near bright enough to be considered a penlight. I tried both lights with fresh batteries, and they both were not great. I am returning them.	negative
Great! Works as stated.	positive
Cute but pretty small. Definitely used as a decoration. I had to buy a real mat to use.	positive
We ordered two of these. One of them didn’t work so we requested a replacement. The replacement arrived in a timely manner but it didn’t work either.	negative
Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy	positive
I’m a 38D 200 Pounds and 5’6 and it fits perfectly, just the end of the sleeves were lose. But, I’m sure with times washing it , it’ll shrink. Delivery was prompt.	positive
This package was not delivered	negative
Love this overall, looks great, easy to install, and great value. Only thing I wish I could tweak a hair is to make the neck just a bit longer so that the shower head could position more like a rain head.	positive
took my dog 20 minutes to destroy this ball.	negative
It glitches already and I haven't had it a whole day yet, might return. Bought as replacement phone but really wish I read through reviews before hand. This phone is not what it says in the description, phone lags, camera sucks, maps freeze and lose location. Spend your money elsewhere.	negative
I like the look of this bottle, but it leaks no matter what I do. I have changed filter as required intervals I have checked little air flapper inside and clean daily. Water just keeps oozing out of the straw and all over my desk and paperwork. Design is flawed	negative
This set of staples doesn't work in the mini stapler that I bought on Amazon.....Jams every time!	negative
Changed my review to 5 stars. I had a problem, turned out to be my printer. Coincidence that it happened right when I changed spools. Jeez.	positive
One of the shams came defective. Quality control did not worked here. Either replace or refund.	negative
A little finicky at times and depending on case, but I've learned to charge phone sitting on its side rather than upright and seems to be working fine. When you lay phone on it, you'll notice the led will be bright, then dim and flash slowly 3 times then go out. This lets you know it is charing. If led stays on or flashes bright it isn't charging. I like it!	positive
I have had these gloves for about a month. I was concerned about ordering online but the measurement was pretty accurate. They fit well and do not hold moisture which prevents smelling. Great purchase for the price.	positive
It was very slow moving & I quit reading about halfway through.	negative
The shells are nice. I only received 4, but I paid for 5.	negative
This is a great book about Ketogenic diet.It gives me a lot of information on how to lose weight. Easy to follow recipes.I like this book.	positive
"Nice but not tall enough. I am 5'4"" and this still was a few inches too low for my neck. Even when placed on the tray in front. Because of that, my neck hurt bending down into the resting hole. Ended up shifting all ten hours of my flight. It didn't feel as if it helped much. Will be searching for a better option."	negative
Not packaged in external box. Product came damaged. No option to return	negative
They were just as I expected. Very good price.	positive
POS! Used it twice and now the network cable tester always shows cable fail. Probe shows conductors 4 and 5 bad. The scanner shows only conductor 5 is bad. Tried two known to be good cables. It only cost $20.00 but it should work longer than two uses. At $20.00 it's not worth the trouble to return it. In the garbage it goes!	negative
"I had this in my car for five weeks and now all it does is light up. Started having problems right away with it skipping stations while driving so I started using Pandora through the blue tooth. Yesterday I get in my car I get a message"" amp error"" and it now only lights up. Should of purchased the warranty package."	negative
it worked great for 2 months then the display kept blinking completely out - then it went out for good until my power went out in my house . when it came back on half of the numbers were only lit. now they are out of stock of course.	negative
Sweet love story but very short. Would have liked to learn more about the characters and the story arc developed more	positive
Great little kit. Great price and value	positive
Me: buys biometric safe on Amazon Also Me: pulls out key and papers from box Me Again: places keys and paperwork in safe so I won’t lose it Me: Closes lid on un-programmed safe and turns it into a paperweight	positive
These were listed as size regular. When I open them they were size regular to large. Way too big for me. I tried to return them and there is a no return policy for these items. Money wasted.	negative
worked for a week and then just stopped	negative
Works well for what it is	positive
Burns popcorn every time regardless of settings or amount popped (and yes, I used brand new Orville Redenbacher's gourmet popcorn). The burnt smell will not wash out of the bowl or lid. Leaves a lot of unpopped kernels. The air popper works much better, does larger batches, and only cost $5 more!	negative
I really love this shampoo and conditioner combo. I never thought a dual product would make my hair as clean and smooth as separate products do, but this totally lives up. It really cuts down my shower time and makes packing for travel easier. I have super thin, color treated hair and it works great. Keep in mind: It does not lather up as much as other products, but it's definitely still getting the job done. I highly recommend it!	positive
I bought this for my large-sized InstantPot. It doesn't fit with the handles. That was easily remedied with pliers and breaking them off. Done carefully enough there was no resulting damage to the basket. After that it fits nicely and works well for a variety of uses. Good quality.	positive
My 5 year old girl loves these. Toes of shoe get scuffed pretty easily.	negative
I was expecting an intelligent discussion on important topics which are not answered. Instead O got a long list of questions from sophomore bull sessions without any discussion. Buy at your peril.	negative
I bought it thinking it would charge my Google Pixel (which requires a USB-C to charge). Though this product has a USB-C, it is only used as an input for charging itself. Therefore, I needed to buy a USB-C to USB cable just to slowly charge my Google Pixel. This product probably can charge my phone one and a half times. It charges fast though--however--with a USB-C cable charge.	positive
Great Product, especially for the price! I have been wearing my silver band for 2 weeks now and it really makes my bracelet look 10 x nicer! Best upgrade for the Flex 2 rubber bracelet bands that you can buy.	positive
Not the fault of the sender I just didn’t like the candy bar	positive
Don’t use a spoon to stir in the pot or it will break. I’m convinced that these pots are designed to be broken and replaced. These decanters are the money makers for the company otherwise they would be made differently.	negative
got on time great movie, movie the case was cracked	positive
Pretty but came with no instructions. I figured it out.	positive
Item received, Thank you very much!	positive
If you never expect to wash it , it would be fine . Washed it once and its all bunched up inside and stitching is coming apart . I thought it would definitely be better quality . would not recommend .	negative
My daughter absolutely loves this; she doesn’t like for me to turn on her over head light in the morning; this amount of light seems to work perfect	positive
They are good quality balls and we found these to be pretty resonance in comparison to so many other sites.	positive
horrible...sent it back. couldn't put it together it was so flimsy and cheap	negative
I like the sewing box very much. It has everything a person needs for sewing purposes. It is adorable.	positive

Flexible cover for key fob. Yet it stays shiny and stands out among the rest of my keys.	positive
Great and simple game my daughter enjoys it.	positive
I purchased this Nespresso for my boyfriend for Christmas since he loved the one he has in his office. After 2 months, we kept coming home to water all over the counter. We have checked the alignment and the plugs - this machine just leaks. Not impressed.	negative
Didn't fit and bought a bigger size too. Gave it to my wife. She loves it. I'll keep shopping.	negative
Don’t want to be negative so I’ll just say that it did not work for me...	negative
"I was excited to give these socks as a present but when they came, they were WAY too big for a ""one size fits all"" deal. There needs to be some basic size options."	negative
Had it for 6 months and it stopped working, I had to call customer service and get it replaced. Other than that it works great.	negative
Didnt finish the first task	negative
Glass is a fraction too wide. Very minimal but enough to make it not stick on one side. After about 2 months of babying the phone the glass had a break across the entire screen. Glass is shatterproof so why? Not worth the price.	negative
I loved my icecream maker - until it started malfunctioning after only a few uses! It soon broken and I have yet to be able to get it replaced!	negative
The pepper grinder fell apart on its first use.	negative
Impressive quality and built. Easy to set up but it was too big to be in cabin for my puppy 🐶 so I am using this as travel kennel.	positive
We needed these for hole signs at a golf tournament. these were perfect! Shipped fast and help up	positive
Bought this in July, 2017. It worked well and I love keeping the sun out before it gets through the windshield. My only problem with this item is that the sunshine deteriorated the silver fabric, causing it to flake off in particles which get all over the interior of my vehicle, on my clothing etc. whenever I put it away. I'm going to try a different brand.	negative
given as a gift. well received	positive
its been just two months and there is already a hole in the mattress. Never had a good sleep. I dont recommend it at all.	negative
First fitness tracker and totally worth the money.I am too surprised with the look and feel.It is comfortable and fits perfectly for any size.It comes with a instructions manual and easy to follow steps.	positive
pretty low quality, save your monies!	negative
Very nice, great quality, I gave as a gift! He loved it!	positive
Super cute and they look just like the picture. The size is nice too.	positive
These were very hard and no favor. I tried them and after 2 bites I just threw the rest in the trash.	negative
Seeds arrived in 1 month. Never germinated after multiple attempts, lame sauce 👎🏼	negative
She likes to hang out on it, sleep, scratch it a bit too. We didn't even use the catnip. Good purchase.	positive
Good details about the Alamo . Some good information about the Alamo. But lacking information in other battles for Texas independence .	positive
I really enjoy this brand of Flaxseed Oil because I can really feel the difference when I take it in a way that distinguishes it from other brands. I love how wholesome it is. It's always packaged and shipped with care and arrived on time, which is always great because I couldn't wait to try it. I am in every way thoroughly pleased with the quality of this product and NatureWise in general.	positive
Not at all what they advertise. They show the full handle and they only send half a handle. First pic is what they advertise and what was received is the second. Will reach out to seller but looks like everyone is getting the half bar.	negative
In my training program, resistance bands are often used not only for exercise, but also as part of the warm-up and relaxation stages, as well as for stretching and active work.	positive
I received a previously opened package that was missing the Allen Wrench and the two set screws.	negative
Works great. At least I hope they do, beware other drivers lol	positive
Great lights. Box came crushed and 3 bulbs were broken.	positive
Paper thin and worthless	negative
This was the only place I could find this color of hat. My husbands golf's and it really keeps him warm. He loves it.	positive
Very nice quality paddle!	positive
These bunion relief sleeves are a great product if you suffer from toe pain. They easily slip right over your feet. The gel pad really helps to cushion the toe area. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend	positive
My grandson loved this gift	positive
I bought more of this commercial grade mesh to keep my dogs from barking by the fence. It was annoying enough to have them bark at the dogs; but one night it turned out to be a skunk. Hopefully this mesh will keep some of the spray from getting on my dogs if the skunk returns.	positive
I was hoping to love this because functionally and the size is just what I needed. However, it's not very stable and is pretty wobbly. Also, there is nothing to secure the drawer, it easily plops out when you pull it out, spilling contents everywhere. Pretty disappointed, especially considering the price point.	negative
Its junk the letters wont stick i had to throw it in the trash not a good product at all i give it -10 stars dont buy it	negative
2 cats in the house, this litter lasts a long time if you clean the box everyday. There is no fake perfume smell in the litter and it controls orders very well.	positive
This is very very small. Really not even big enough to play with. Photo of item is very misleading.	negative
Super cute, quality suit! The top on the red is cut very narrow so you get some side boob action and I wish I had went a size down!	positive
Completely stopped working!!!! Which is a complete waste of money! And I could not return it because it basically stopped working after the end of the return date! Do not buy!!	negative
These layered necklaces are really in fashion now so I've been wanting to purchase. Finally got it and happy I did. Very cute for every day or even a night out	positive
I purchased these a few months back for listening to music while I cycle indoors, replacing a pair of bluetooth wireless earbuds from Soundpeats that lasted 18 months before they finally died. Unfortunately that model is no longer made so I tired the Oontz. They worked for about 20 minutes the first time I used them, despite being fully charged. I charged them again, and the same result - the battery lasted about 20 minutes. Now they won't hold a charge at all and the battery indicator will not turn on while charging.	negative
Good investment for any phone today	positive
Very very loosely was the movie attached to these stories. The movies had better ideas. But these stories were fairly entertaining and keeps one thinking as to what is going to happen next.	positive
Have not received item and now its too late and my son wont have them for prom.	negative
Great way to lower the proof and open up your Bourbon. Price is a little steep but I would buy again.	positive
The ear pieces dont stay in the right spot and it slides down on his forehead all the time.	negative
Bought these for my husband last Christmas. He loves them and wears them religiously. Very comfortable.	positive
The author makes interesting points/theories but then tells a long-winded story (based on real life events) that intentionally omits certain facts to make the story sound better and fit the proposed theory. I have actually read similar stories that interpreted the facts to reach different points/theories. I felt like there were some credibility issues with this book. Also, I read/listened to the book because i was hoping i could learn some concrete tools that i could use to replace my bad habits with goods habits. I did not find those tools in this book.	negative
Roomy backpack, good price. Sturdy	positive
Don't buy, doesnt' work	negative
I bought this for one thing - chicken wings. As it turns out, it cuts the bone/joint just fine - however...it will not cut thru the skin, hence it's worthless to me. I returned to my tried and true kitchen shears and consider this a lesson learned. If you plan to cut anything with skin, keep looking.	negative
Had they shown up on the date as shown , well they might have made some one happy. Order cancelled with after-purchase late notice of the deliver date change.	negative
I used this band to run while I was pregnant. It's great quality and held everything in. Just be sure not to wear it too tight.	positive
I ordered this brush a few months back. It was a great bursh at first and did a good job of blending my liquid foundation. However, after about 3 months of use the bristles on the brush began to loosen up and would fall out when applying my makeup. What started off as a wonderful brush ended up only lasting 3 months.	negative
Can't even get this to load. Tried 4 times so far. Glitch in the app?	negative
My 6 mos old mini aussie puppy is a quasi power chewer so I like a thick bully stick- these fit the bill without being over-priced or smelly. Will def reorder. PS- I've tried a few brands now and this is a great buy.	positive
They sound good and the battery life lasts a lot longer then what I expected	positive
Purchased this to finish the install of CAT5E network in my home. The first network tester worked once, then failed when just checking commercial cables. Was sent a replacement and started using that network tester to identify cable runs. Quality components at that price point.	positive
This was my first Dean Koontz book and I really enjoyed the writing style. I loved the suspense. I will read more of him now.	positive
The bat looked good upon purchase but my grandson used it in a baseball game and it bend/ dented on the first hit. Not a good buy. Had to use a team mate bat til his mom purchased another one.	negative
This was for my son's Speedo Goggles. They have a strap that has stopped working for him. These worked great and now his goggles stay on his face. He also has an additional strap that he can use later.	positive
My husband hated this case because it was not easy to take out of his pants pocket. He took it off and threw it away.	negative
It’s crazy how far this thing stick out. We can’t find a single place to put this where it doesn’t look ridiculous with how far away from the wal the towel is.	negative
It is fine, I wish the color had been alittle different green to have better matched the toilet	positive
This KRUPS electric kettle performs just as advertised, the best one we've had.	positive
It stopped charging and then over heated for the entire day and still wouldn’t charge	negative
These guys will keep harassing you until you write a review.	negative
I got the blue one.Very cool in the dark. Lights go fast when its charging and then slows down when its charged. Wish it was longer tho- would buy more if it was.	positive
nozzle is hard to open and close. could have a better design pattern.	negative
The case is actually worth the money, you won’t regret getting it	positive
This is our third cot that we have purchased. They are great for our grand kids to sleep on. They are sturdy and have held up nicely, although I need to replace one. They are not made to be jumped on, which is clearly said in instructions. Not a manufacturer fault...grand kid fault!	positive
I loved that they fit they were perfect.	positive
It would be better if it didn't turn so often on my dog's leash. Other than that, it gives off a nice bright light. I now use a safety pin and pin it higher up on my leash so that's easy to see.	positive
I am writing this review to warn people that it isn't very secure as i lost the entire band on the third day of wearing it. I did follow directions so that wasn't the problem but rather it must have caught on something without my notice. You also can't see through it which is a bit annoying when i did have it. It needs a snap not just velcro	negative
Should fit a little tighter	positive
Very comfortable. Wide headband. Wide range of adjustability. The only problem I had with them is my glasses are quite large and get stuck inside. I must take off both the goggles and my glasses and then pry my glasses out of the goggles. I have this issue with most of the goggles I have used so it's just something I have gotten used to. Fast delivery and well packaged. I will order again.	positive
Jewels were not all there when I recieved.	negative
Broke after a few uses. Emailed DoTERRA, havent heard back	negative
Cute bows, but definitely not what I expected! Two bows that my daughter wanted didn’t come inside so two missing bows and the alligator clips used are cheap! We didn’t use the bows at all a waste of money I missed the return window so now we are stuck with bows that won’t be used 👎🏽	negative
Item arrived tangled and defective. I couldn’t get pass the untangling, so I will be returning this product unfortunately.	negative
It's a very bad product. After finally using morrocan oil repair shampoo and conditioner , I'm very unhappy with the outcome of these products it left my hair brittle and dry. Very disappointed.I just start using this product and just realize the return window is close already.. Do not buy this product I hear from three of my friends they all experienced same ..:((	negative
The shower head does not light up and I was looking forward to the lights.	negative
Not to bad! it’s very spacious and has a lot of pocket. However I don’t like how it opens all the way around and I wouldn’t over pack it to much because it’s not so durable. The price is right though lol	positive
I added a star because it is helping my itchy scalp, but it is very watery and since the seal was already broken before I even used it I suspect it was watered down from it's original form. Too pricey for what you get.	negative
Absolutely love this comforter. Super warm and not overly heavy. When I first got it in the mail and took it out of the box, it appears very thin and not fluffy at all. After laying it out on the bed for a few hours it fluffed up nicely and after sleeping with it, I woke up and it was even more fluffy. I'm sure it will be perfect for this winter.	positive
Ordered as a 1080P DVR as stated in description and what is shown in picture. Found that I was sent a 720p model.	negative
great at getting you pumped up. directions said one scoop and it was more than enough	positive
For some reason, these make a terrible noise on our new tile. The felt is thick, which I found rather promising. Unfortunately, it’s also very hard, so I’m thinking these were doing the opposite of protecting my floors. I would return them if I hadn’t already ruined them by sticking them on all of our chairs before having to pull them back off. During the removal process, I did find that the adhesive works better than most felt pads I’ve tried...I just wish the pads were softer and less like mini Brillo pads.	negative
I got them for driving & have been great for about a year now. Reduce glare & I can even see good at night with them on.	positive
thin so isn't good for wipe warmer but good	positive
Pages were not cut Properly. Bad quality for a 25th anniversary book. The content of the book is good.	positive
Disappointed... Started excellent then became trite ...expected more	negative
very light use, changed battery and no longer function	negative
The product is great, but all the coins shifted during shipment.	positive
This stuff doesn't float, it immediately starts to sink to the bottom. We've started using it to feed a small Koi we have out in our pond, but the goldfish in our fountain have to follow it all the way down.	negative
durable, light, fits in my golf bag.. works as advertised.	positive
Wow! These feathers are absolutely beautiful!! Very nicely packaged. Perfect for my VBS project!! I need to discover more feathers projects so I can order them again!! 😃	positive
It looked like a really good thermos and I was super excited but, it came damaged. Like, come on did I just get someone else's used stuff? Did people drink out of this already? I don't even want it now smh. So disappointed	negative
I do like it but I wish the clip was more Durable	positive
The prong or whatever that goes into the holes on the band feels like a cheap plastic that'll break easy, but otherwise i'm happy with it. Should be a nice addition to Pride.	positive
The outfit itself is adorable. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was that the top was a little loose. I bought this for my daughter’s photo shoot. I took the right measurements described on the sizing chart & got the correct size off the chart. Came out to the same size she’s already wearing but, unfortunately we are going to have to taylor the top a bit.	positive
The poles are made of extremely thin metal. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get them straight. Two of the pointy stakes snapped off in the ground. I’ve used them and they are dirty from being in the ground or I’d return them!	negative
Cheaply made with cardboard and lightweight craft wood. The knobs are a major hazard for little ones. Regret the purchase.	negative
Easy to use and install. Happy there is no annoying sound announcing a call has been received.	positive
I’m very happy with the results I’m getting from the serum. Fine lines are disappearing, skin looks brighter and more hydrated . You have to be consistent and use it daily, in order to see results. I would definitely purchase this again.	positive
Zipper broke after 4 months. This should not have happened. Amazon refused to help. I would like the vendor to replace product or provide a refund. Thank you.	negative
Ugg...Felt like a 1950s stereotype of rich southerners, but the characters were so cartoonish & unbelievable for current day and time. Maybe I hated it because I'm from the South, & it was like a driving miss daisy but with younger sexy characters.	negative
Looks exactly like the picture. Great for holding little things.	positive
Larger than expected. Does not fit in a small-medium handbag, but does fit in made medium-large handbags and backpacks.	positive
Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it’s a fun book!	positive
My daughter loves her fairy house kit! It has held up nicely in our garden.	positive
This thing does a mediocre job, at best, on pet hair, and for a final win, dies with less than a year of use. Complete waste.	negative
Just received but very impressed. Little tight, I'm sure it'll losen up after some time. Strong magnet. Nice look. Plenty of pockets. Color is nice. Just a real nice product.	positive
After 3 months of normal using, now it stops working. For $11 a better quality product is expected.	negative
Showed up looking like it fell off the truck...	negative
This compressor no good the ac clutch shorted and seized the compressor	negative
My daughter's result became dark green immediately! the reviews of this product pretty much convinced me that i was having a grandson. That's a boy right? Nope. Blood test shows she's having a girl! If you want something to pretend you know, then by all means, buy it. But this product is 50/50 to get it right. I would've been better off putting a gender on a little piece of paper, and pulling it from a hat. Total rip off. Don't waste your money!	negative
good bench for what ya pay. the hardware was tapped/ died pretty sloppy took a couple feeds to get the nuts and bolts to work well...but all in all this is a very nice light duty bench.	positive
Seems like sturdy construction and quality but tried on two cars and didn't fit on either dashboard (2009 BMW X5 and 2009 Nissan Murano)	negative
Work fine but numbers are difficult to read	negative
Definitely NOT compatible with iPhoneX. Money wasted! Return process seems deliberately complicated to deter any returns. Seller does not reply to emails.	negative
This product replaced the original motor. Time accuracy is spot on!	positive
It does not fit the sides on the phone and it isn't private either. It's really a huge waste of money.	negative
This pump has failed is there warranty on it?	negative
Very nice money well spent love it	positive
It took forever to get this product. Its not great quality fabric kind of rough for a baby.	negative
I thought it was the wrong size for my Nalgene wide-mouth, but it fits absolutely perfectly. This thing makes the Nalgene wide-mouth the best water bottle I've ever used. I like putting ice in my drinks but hate when the ice clogs the opening, but this prevents it. Also, the large hole on the rear wall is for the air to escape so you get a nice smooth flow of water.	positive
It was great for the first month, then it starts leaking. I don't know from where, but it's somewhere between the glass bottle and plastic.	negative
These screen protectors work well. They were the correct size and easy to install	positive
Not even close in size!	negative
This is the only kind of underwear that my husband will wear. The big stores carry regular Jockey boxers, but, not the tapered ones. Thank goodness I found them here!	positive
O.K. for the price. Not so sturdy. Was broken in the first 2 days.	positive
Exactly like the picture, great material and quality.	positive
I bought to take with me to Europe. The item description says it can work with hairdryers and that was the only reason I bought this item. Once I came to Europe specifically Estonia where electricity 220 V, it not only did not work but blew up my hairdryer. I just came back and trying to return these items and I can't, because the return window has passed, and being in Europe there was no way I could return it. Now I stuck with these useless pieces of crap and out of my money.	negative
So much fun. Kids love it. The toys could be single toys or play together. The music makes kids happy too.	positive
Never received item. Amazon refunded my purchase.	negative
Fast shipping, easy to install, good quality item. Highly recommended.	positive
Upon opening the box and taking it out, the cart was bent on the end and all scratched up when I pulled it from the box.	negative
I have bought these socks 3 times and each purchase the socks were different sizes. Two sets did go over the calf. The last and largest purchase were the shortest and do not go over the calf. I purchased these to wear with motorcycle boots. Not happy with the obvious multiple manufacturers making much different products under supposed same specs.	negative
great product great price	positive
This case is super cute	positive
I sized down and ordered the xs for my 7 year old, but the length of the dress is just excessive. The xs is supposed to be for a *child* age 4-6. But it’s 47” long! It is so long it fits me, an adult, just fine. I’ve never before purchased something so out of whack with standard sizes. A 47” dress claiming to fit 4-6 year olds is just ludicrous.	negative
I bought this because I needed a long strap during winter. The short straps kept slipping off the shoulder of my coat. I pack everything in my work bag including my lunch and travel mug. It's narrow and tall instead of wider at the base.	positive
Color just sits on top of my hair, didnt like it at all.	negative
This is not a cutting tool, it is a piece of cast steel that has been chromed to look like the actual tool. I would have been happier if they had just sent me a piece of candy and a note explaining what a fool I am for ordering this instead of wasting their time making such a poor quality reproduction. Took over a month to arrive as well.	negative
Particularly like the color! Very vibrant. Nice size; feels good in your hand and pours well. Great kettle	positive
love the series !! Hope there are more to come !	positive
Disappointed with this purchase! After 1yr I still have the dress havent worn it because it was too big	negative
These gloves are just like the ones in doctor offices or hospitals! They're just what I was looking for.	positive
Love these. They work so well. Easy to clean.	positive
Easy to install. Exactly what I was looking for you cool my large room.	positive
These are nice quality jeans. They fit just as expected. A little loose at the waist and I have to do some constant tugging, but I had read that in some reviews before purchasing. I would highly recommend these pants.	positive
Ordered 2. Both arrived damaged. Unfortunately I don't have access to a printer or the ability to have a label printed I am stuck with them. I intended them as a going away gift for a co worker and won't be able to get replacements in time.	negative
Great! Just as advertised	positive
Perfect fit and well built has not rattled at all with an adjustment keeps my kids safe	positive
Beautiful necklace, wonderful memory of our time in Maui!	positive
I bought the sea foam set first and loved them and turned right around and bought the blue. I washed them all once with no problems, they have a smell to them when they arrive, I suggest washing them before hanging them. I steamed them and they look great. They're very long and even though I could raise the rods I like the way they hang. They have weights to keep them in place and they have the look of linen without the fuss. Love, love, love them.	positive
I order it and was to small it's not a large more like a extra small very upset.	negative
All the reviews said they headlights leak and to silicone the seam on them to prevent moisture from getting in. I siliconed the seams and they still let water in and this is on a vehicle that is parked all of the time! Very dissapointed	negative
Doesn't stick to my door and ripped the paint off my wall.	positive
The material is cheap . Will never wear it	negative
Washed these sheets and it’s like they melted! Some parts were as if wax was dropped on them (the material melted on those spots). The spots were not there before washing but showed up after drying. We dry on the lowest setting and we have new washers and dryers as of 5 months ago. A little sad that we didn’t go with another brand.	negative
Fit as expected. Has adjustable strap for perfect fit.	positive
Another reviewer commented that there was a manufacturing defect in the toe of these boots that was a permanent crease. I never imagined this would be common but it was on both of the boots I ordered. They came in a shoe bag, not box, and they were very squashed. Also I ordered kids size 1 and they were huge. The ankle area was giant they were falling off both my kids feet. Returned both pair.	negative
Not screen protector or back of phone protector friendly. Also prevented me from using Google maps during to it interfering with the signal. On the plus side the case does look awesome.	negative
I had to return this one although it was pretty neat it was small for my daughters lunch as she stays longer at school than most children	positive
When people see this ashtray,they laugh out loud.. Great product..	positive
Installation was a breeze and it was half the price of home depot. Greta job!	positive
Not the most stylish but works well got intended purpose and has held up.	positive
Cheap, but works WELL!	positive
It was working well for a while, but then the headphones itself started to turn on google voice on it's own and it somehow pauses my music and controls my volume. Do yourselves a favor and move on, and don't by this headphone. Walk on by.	negative
Good product. Good customer service.	positive
Firstly, I do like the backdrop. But in the product overview, it says that there are 3 velcro mounting loops: One at the top (i.e. portrait) and two along one side (i.e. landscape). I only have the one at the top. Also, the muslin has started to wrinkle, but I guess (hope) this can be steamed out?	negative
"I love this watch, but it died less than 2 years after purchase. Seiko was willing to ""fix"" it for full price. I would not recommend any product the manufacturer does not stand behind."	negative
Towels fray somewhat easily in the washer and dryer, but they're pretty nice for the price.	positive
Sherpa part gets rough after washing on hand wash only	negative
I bought this in anticipation of eventually getting an iPhone 11, and it looks really good! The design is sleek and hip, and I like the raised edges a lot. The transparent back feels sturdy to fit a card holder on, and it also doesn't interfere with my wireless charger at all. Overall, pretty solid product that I expect will last a long time.	positive
My kids love this. It has fun learning things to do for all ages and skill levels. Very satisfied with the purchase.	positive
Great case. Would use again	positive
Damaged in package. Card was bent. Very disappointed in my purchase.	negative
It got very hot every time I used it. On the fifth day I had it the charger stopped working. It is totally dead now. I will be returning it.	negative
Worked great when I was engorged, once I was not filling up as much I had a hard time getting this to keep suction, did not work well staying on when I tried to use on my other side when breastfeeding, its a great concept but only ok in actual use, I never used it on its own, only when feeding	positive
Hardly registers, creates multiple windows errors on 10, takes forever to load and the transfer speed is the worst, my usb thumb drive for 2008 transfers faster than this POS. save yourself the money, DO NOT BUY. will be returning.	negative
Very nice and thick high quality towels.	positive
Liked everything, especially the history lessons contained in his stories.	positive
Too small , won’t buy again	negative
I wouldn’t bother ordering. Almost a week after promised delivery and it still isn’t here. I now have no gift for Father’s Day and have to go through the process of trying to get a refund.	negative
These yoga pants were very comfortable and fit as expected. They were a nice high rise and the material was very soft and silky.They had good flexibility and stretch. Really liked the fit.	positive
Longest lasting, quality Samsung batteries. Much better than any 6 Sony version.	positive
Enjoyable but challenging.	positive
I really like the flavor of these. They also worked great. I took several before a job interview and they really helped calm my nerves.	positive
The overall size fits the style I prefer. Some hats of this style have a larger external size than expected.	positive
I saw the reviews and took a gamble anyway since some people said it worked for them and was a genuine Samsung charger that has fast charging. I wanted another charger in the house. I just got it. Plugged it in to my S8+ and no fast charge. Tried my off-brand charger and the charger that came with my S8+ and those both worked just fine for fast charging. This charger is probably a genuine Samsung charger but it's not the one that can be used for S8+ fast charging. Complete waste of money!	negative
Came cracked and returned	negative
Just what I needed. No bending needles anymore.	positive
Says it was delivered today. I did not receive this product today.	negative
Not what I thought it would be. The buttons did not work and you have to purchase a memory card. Retuned the same day I received and was even charged to send it back since I live no where close to an amazon locker....	negative
The bags are kinda small and will tear when trying to pick up the doo, especially a soft doo.	positive
"Fits my Granite Ware Covered roaster perfectly & it was easy to clean. I would have liked it to have been a bit higher, like 1/4"" so that the item on the rack is higher out of the drippings/liquids."	positive
Orderd these tail light expecting at minimal to get the hardware no screws no bulbs no adapters for the bulbs found them at my local advance all in one kit same price very disappointed	negative
Works great for our Whirlpool fridge. The Every Drop filters are super expensive and this filter works just as well and you get 3 for the same price as a single every drop filter. Water tastes great.	positive
I love the materials and the color is so vibrant. The only problem was their sizing is too small, need to return the one I ordered and reorder a one-size extra. Hoping that the material is still the same as the one delivered.	positive
This tissue box is perfect! Matches my decor perfectly. Yes, the original Kleenex paper box does not fit but who cares. Open up the Kleenex box remove the tissues and put them directly in your new container. It's exactly what I wanted! Great wood and sturdy box, well crafted and painted. Colors are perfect!	positive
Fit well. Wiring diagram not included but written on small letters on the wires themselves ( wiah i saw that earlier:( ..? )on harness. Installation was fine, had to cut out back end of the old beetle radio slot to make new one fit. Overall happy with product!	positive
It definitely wasn't what I expected ,my childs head still tilts when falling asleep. But my child loves the cushiony fill.	negative
Didn’t like this frame a lot of the bedazzled has already fallen off in the pack.. very poor	negative
Good quality sound but very disappointed that the ear bud covers are not clear as advertised in the picture. They are a dark grey which I do not like at all.	negative
Cute idea but very poor execution. The flags were not in a pattern. They started out in one and lost it. I had two of same color and pattern side by side and it threw the whole thing. It was noticed by a few guests too even when I thought I’d be the only to notice. It looks appropriate in the picture but poor attention to detail on the one I purchased. Cute otherwise and nice quality	negative
Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.	positive
Battery never work Seller never responded	negative
Very pleased, great taste!!	positive
Display didn't work on remote	negative
I buy these fins all the time as I own a swim school. Sadly one pair came completely ripped down the side. Because I ordered them way in advance, I didn’t notice the rip until it was too late to return. I would love for the company to contact me	negative
I like Micheal Bennett ‘s character but this story was a little too soft	positive
They are nice pillowcases. They fit my pillows perfectly. They are supper soft.	positive
nice bag, but the smell it comes with is so strong and overwhelming no matter what i did the smell never went away. did not use it at all have it somewhere in the closet since i received it...	negative
I like it, but not exactly what fits our current needs!	positive
This is the third time, in my pocket and the part near the aux plug snapped and broke. If the hard shell was something stronger than plastic it would last forever. However, it's plastic and if it lasts more than a week your lucky. This is the only case I called find for my Vivo 8, so I am keeping the hard rubber inner she'll as that part does provide excellent protection for the phone. That is the only reason I give two stars.	negative
Very flattering on me. Ive been looking for dresses that are comfortable, casual, but can be dressed up. Im 5'7, 225 lbs and this dress hit right at my knee and hides my mommy tummy. I plan on buying more.	positive
Professional look, visible from the sidewalk its nice.	positive
Pretty disappointed when it arrived. The wig looked nothing like the picture and was pretty shiny.	negative
These are really cute and they did arrive early! I was expecting them to be a little bigger, but the oil and vinegar bottles do hold a decent amount. However, I’ve rated these only 2 stars because it does feel like they would break VERY easily. Also, some of the wording on the bottles were smudged and a couple of letters looked like they were chipped off or something. In my opinion, I think these would work better for decoration, but not exactly for practical cooking purposes.	negative
Arrived with one broken bottle, one bottle almost empty. They put the case in a mail basket to contain the leaking soda. I had to wash the sticky soda off 22 bottles. When I opened a bottle to drink, there was a rusty taste, had to rinse off the top of the bottle after opening to get rid of the rust taste!	negative
works great wood buy agin	negative
Very nice, but did have to unzip it and remove some stuffing as it was a bit to firm.	positive
Love the product really extends my lashes. You have to put on regular mascara first then this product makes your lashes look like they are false.	positive
These are drying and not at all what I expected. I didn't like any of the colors and even tried using with a top coat of clear gloss and didn't help. I threw them in the trash.	negative
Returned. Looked like a potato sack	negative
We have boughten this brand of ink multiple times and it has always worked for our printer!	positive
I was blinging out a pair of converse sneakers. This is nothing more than a stick with wax on the end and not long into the process the wax fell off and the wouldn't stick to the stick. I don't recommend this for that kind of project. I wasted my money.	negative
Beautiful box, would buy again !	positive
It is thin, very light and fun to use	positive
Easy to use. Sound is good.	positive
It fits with the bottle although it leaves a small gap where the top and the bottom meet. It’s also very easy for baby to move it around but it does give that extra help for babies to grip the bottle better.	positive
Can't tell different after use. Product is not that expensive compared with other brands, however I think you get what you paid for. this product is not that effective like other brands.	negative
Leather is nice and soft; buckles are sturdy	positive
You have to practically scrub your face to get the oil off. I should have bought the blue ones!	negative
This is beautiful! Looks cute on my daughter. None of the stones have fallen out and we play with it several times a week for the past couple of months.	positive
Did really like the color so I sent them back!	negative
Great Price. Great Quality!	positive
Not as described. Listed as very good condition. Old & creased.	negative
the magnet almost caused my phone to loose it's rom please be careful with this case around the razer phone 2	negative
Very nice bag. Fits my 17 inch lap top as stated in the description. Nice leather and good quality.	positive
Not delivered on time.	negative
This book makes me cry every single time I read it, much like Robert Munch's classic Love You Forever does. It is so, so beautiful with an empowering message for little girls everywhere. Buy it for your girls and your boys. Buy it because its a classic and it belongs on your bookshelf, Muslim or not.	positive
This is a very lightweight sharpener that is easy to use and fast. Very suitable for home use.	positive
Very thin material, does not work as intended.	negative
Terrible product. Used it occasionally. The heater element stopped working after only 4 months.	negative
The sleep game has been changed. Awesome weighted blanket.	positive
Good price and nice look. Good for gaming. Worth it!	positive
pass on these. Whenever my small dog urinates on these, the urine runs over the edges if she squats too close. Then I have to spend more time cleaning the floor or rug where these were placed. She weighs about 8 pounds, imagine what a larger dog would do! No...these are not good at all.	negative
Remote stop working right away. Very nice colors but not helpful if the remote doesn't work and you can't change the colors	negative
I would have been more impressed with the sound of just lighting 30.00 on fire and watching it burn. This is the biggest piece of junk on the planet. Please don't buy it. Save up a little more money and buy a reputable amp. If you're wondering, this amp is only as powerful as a stock head unit. Nothing more. Its no where near 200w worth of power, not even on its best day.	negative
Bought this to use in the car and it was great in theory but it's just a pain. This would be good for restaurant or airplane use but for use on the back of a car seat is cumbersome.	negative
Cant tell over the picture so i'll tell you right now. Ir is very very thin for it to be called a jacket. Imagine a hanes white undershirt, thats as close to as thin as it is.	negative
Nice strong smell of the candle	positive
I received my package with no pens!! I will not be buying from this seller again!!	negative
Does not have much sucking power. Got it for litter box area and it struggles. Need to clean filter often.	negative
The screw and the bolt cannot be bolted together as the inner threads of the bolt are damaged hence the camera cannot be fixed to the hand grip.	negative
Horrible! Tear right away and for sure not waterproof	negative
Leaks and I tried twice. You can’t point them downward or the water just streams out and one kept leaking from the trigger button.	negative
Arrived earlier than expected! Looks exactly the same as the picture; very vivid and the pattern is so pretty. Just what I wanted and probably the best $5 I've spent in a while. Would definitely recommend	positive
Trying to set it, after I was connected to the wifi, it said go back to the app. I was already in the app and no further instructions for the next step.	negative
The packaging was nice and the style is as pictured, but these are very overpriced for the quality. The fabric is thin. I wear a size 8.5-9 and they are somewhat small and uncomfortable. I also didn't notice when ordering but they don't come with the option for return, so I guess I'm stuck with socks I'll never use.	negative
Tiny. Disappointed for the price.	negative
After installing this my washing machine worked just fine. After 2 months it quit working again. It could be my machine but since it worked fine for a couple months I have to assume that it was the drain pump.	negative
DO NOT order from this company. They will continue to charge you. They charged me for a second shipping that I never ordered or received. The 12 people that rated this are probably friends of theirs. VERY disappointed to have to deal with another scam	negative
These were meant to be a gift for my father, but they did not come in their boxes, and instead were just packaged loose in bubble wrap. I’ve ordered these before and received them in their factory box, which has some nice little tips on how to drink your whiskey. The glasses are, however, genuine. Nothing was damaged. If you’re looking for a glass that really enhances the experience and allows you to fully appreciate your Whisk(e)y, this is it.	negative
I broke the first so I ordered the second one. The heating element burned half immediately after I placed in the tank.	negative
It’s great product and easy to use . I only use one piece in my belly, you will feel hot in just few minutes. This little piece works great. Price for this is very nice too!	positive
The product is good, but the bottle leaked in shipment.	positive
The door seems a little thin, but it is perfect for what I needed.	positive
I mean it'd be one thing to send the incorrect product, it's another to send a fake packaged as the correct product.	negative
These are NOT Peels by Smart Needle! They may look like it and they may call them Peels but trust me they are not! The material is different and with less than 24 hours use they will not return to their original shape to tightly hug a spool of thread. If you've used Peels by Smart Needle keep looking and buy the real thing. If you have not used Peels by Smart Needle before don't waste your time with these. Deceptive description! They are going back!	negative
Broke the first time my husband use it. He's 176 pounds!	negative
Came as a pair, these get lost frequently and worked perfectly as a drop-in replacement for the eyepiece I lost. Fits well and should be perfectly serviceable. Item shipped and arrived very quickly. Would recommend if you don't want to pay Canon prices.	positive
The lid did not work like I thought it would. It slides open if it tips over, which is why I bought it in the first place	negative
Gift item...was loved	positive
Its way better than I expected and I love it! It's meant to be over sized so order your normal size. I am using in between a Large and XL so I ordered a XL and I could have gotten away with large and it would have probably still be over sized.	positive
Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....	negative
Less of it is needed. It works well, but as the package says you HAVE to scoop up the clumps daily for full effectivness.	positive
This is the second bottle I've bought. I like the way it softens my hair without being greasy and leaving residue. It also has a pleasant scent.	positive
I appreciate that it's safe on my dog's paws, but I noticed that it doesn't seem to be effective at very low temps, like 0 and below.	positive
Does not fit right......plastic knobs still wobble on the fender 5-way switch; annoying.	negative
These are very sturdy and produce a good loud sound that can be heard over music.	positive
Super cute costume. It is a fleece material so it can get warm if you are wearing to a party indoors. But many compliments on it and everyone loved it including me!	positive
This paint is NOT returnable. The paint is watery. I did read thru the reviews before I purchased and did read that it needs to be aggressively shaken. Which I did three times. I even used a toothpick to try and stir the paint. Same result. Watery. Then find out because it is a flammable liquid it cannot be returned thru Amazon. Must go to the manufacturer. Not worth the time.	negative
Do not use for scuba diving, the fins will not fit with dive boots. I wear a size 10 dive boots and I bought the large/XL size, and they still are tight with boots, even though they aren't meant to be worn with dive boots. Quality gear, just buy for snorkeling only.	positive
Too small, awkward to use all the clear straps. Just generally all feels awkward on the body.	negative
Fits okay - not at all what I expected though. The pom poms are not as pictured, they are just in a layer of tulle and pooling at the bottom. After one wear they are just in a big clump. Not good. I'm not happy but she's worn it so I won't return.	negative
I ordered the gold frame with green lenses. I received the all black style.	negative
I'm returning this item $50 plus $24 for limited monitoring and gps tracking a month. Battery fully charged died within 5 hours. Not the best. Plus I'm out the $24 SIM for the month	negative
Love them fits perfect, thank you. Great for walking .	positive
This is total escapism woven into a great adventure story! The tale begins in modern time, then through a twist of fate the heroine finds herself in the 17th century being carried off by pirates. This is a fast paced adventure that will keep you turning the pages to find out if our heroine returns to her own time period, or will she stay in the past with her newfound love.	positive
Only 1 out of 3 cords works.	negative
My hubby received this as a present. I was not able to take a picture because he wore it immediately and left with it on. He likes the fit, feel and all the compliments. You will not be disappointed with this. It is so realistic. I will update how it washes soon.	positive
Too wordy, terrible representation of eating disorders. As if a buttered grilled cheese will stop you from having food disorders in one sitting. You just don't care about these characters. Couldn't wait for it to be over. Actually, I didn't.	negative
NICE COVER, GOOD FIT	positive
Very cute, soft and comfortable! Surprise for an adult HK lover. Order 1 size up for a relaxed fit.	positive
I just reread all of Promises and the Bounty Hunters series before reading this new addition. I really enjoy the badasses falling in love trope and A. E. Via writes them really well. I found this book an e en more interesting version of this trope. Both main characters are truly brass but not very typical otherwise. And I loved that one of them comes from a Muslim background. His approach to romance was unusual ( in this day and age) and fascinating to read. Great writing and interesting MC's.	positive
About six medicine pills will enter, but the medicinal black paint will also adhere to the medicine. It is better to avoid coloring.	negative
I would have given it 5 stars but there are no photos. It's easier to tell if a recipe might be good if we can see a photo of it.	positive
Microphone has static noise when recording it's gotten worse over time other than that it's great	positive
Another issue with them sending a different color than advertised. Dissatisfied.	negative
I was all into this book	positive
It would be a great product but after having it for only a month it is already rusting in multiple spots.	negative
This turned out amazing!! The cap fit perfectly and arrived on time. I looked like my kid did not have hair. Looked like i was looking at my husband, him being bald, it was freaky! I would highly recommend this. It is cheap, looks good and feels good.	positive
Purse seemed fine. It was about the right size, all zippers worked fine, and I loved the number of pockets. The inside pockets tended to gape open if anything was in them so I only used the zippered ones. Then the loop that held the shoulder strap on broke. I've used the purse daily for less than two months. I never overloaded it. The stitching just came apart while I was walking. I will not get another one.	negative
These worked temporarily. The black elastic extenders didn’t work at all. They just stretched and didn’t help bring the pieces together which left a big gap that was impossible to hide. The jean extenders worked but with only being a couple inches I was only able to wear them for a short amount of time before I grew out of them. I would’ve like to see a stronger elastic that allowed stretch but also helped bring the pant buttons together.	negative
My normal charger has more power then this, keep phone cool but it’s doesn’t charge fast. It feels like a good Quality item. -iPhone X-	negative
The main purpose I bought this is to make almond butter. I have a professional blendtec and a twister jar. Tried for over 30 min. All it made was almond powder. I threw the whole thing out 3 pounds worth	negative
to tight on my legs,and my legs are normal sized	negative
These are mostly excerpts consequently very unsatisfying to read.	negative
The quality of the picture is not so good.	positive
Seems to be too hard for the baby to teethe and chew on. Not recommended.	negative
Was focused on the quick charge but misunderstood that this was not a magnetic retention. Had planned to use in car but skid pad it comes with wasn't going to hold phone the way I needed (vent).	negative
Was very happy arrived in time and good quality.. Will order again	positive
it was no fault of Clever Creations, but I never received this product. Fed-Ex destroyed it when it was shipped and Amazon credited my account instead of reordering this product.	negative
I was really excited about these chargers. At first they worked great. Since purchasing every one has stopped working.	negative
Perfect for my daughters gymnastics- true to size, good quality for the price. Would buy again/recommend.	positive
If only the inside spring is covered so that it won’t rust overtime.Dont think I want to be drinking it with spring is open from the inside of the cover.	positive
Before removing the old gas cap, I test fitted this one. Right away I could tell it was far better made than the original. Its ratchet mechanism was tighter and it was very simple to attach to cap lanyard to the gas cap door. I am sure I will not be seeing any pesky loose gas cap messages and lights on my console for some time.	positive
Does not fit or look like the photos . the chest area is cut way too deep... its to bad because if it was cut correctly the dress would be adorable. The body of the dress fits true to size. However the dress is not wearable because of the cut in the chest area And the arm holes.	negative
The sand table is light weight and easy to move. It is easy to attach the cover to the sand table. The cover keeps the sand dry even during a hard rain.	positive
The size came way to big and I buy the same size on every other pair of pants	negative
It's is attractive, highly functional and offers excellent protection.	positive
I never received my order	negative
Great material. I’m a perfect XL and per reviews I ordered a XXL and it fit exactly how I wanted it to !	positive
Haven't read it yet.	positive
This is creepy. I think these pills are fake. The brand cannot be found anywhere else on the internet and the phone number on the bottle is some random persons number.	negative
I've been using this for a couple months now. Its ok. Sometimes it doesn't always allow fast charging	positive
My dog was able to chew through it in a matter of days. But it was cute	negative
I was making cookies, and it seemed like the mixer had to labor a little. In kind of a small jumping motion. I kinda had to hold it in. Place. Maybe the cookie mix was not moist enough. We will see in the future.	positive
Delivery was sooner than expected,was purchased for babyshower , the expectant mom loved it!!.	positive
Keeps my face from drying up and wrinkling. Been using it for about 3 or 4 years and never feels greasy Even my husband uses it. We use daily one plunger worth for the entire face and neck after we shower. Bottle lasts a long time.	positive
Using this with a wifi module for a remote 3D printer monitor and it works great.	positive
Really sturdy plastic, fast boiling and doesn’t scale you to the touch. I’m really pleased.	positive
This does nothing. It didn’t remove collar stains any better than pretreating, and it did little to lift coffee stains and it should never be used for pit stains: I think it made them worse. It does smell okay, but only if you like how conventional detergents smell. I’ll stick to borax. This is at once too much, and nothing at all.	negative
I searched hard for a case and based on the reviews landed on this one. Unfortunately that was a mistake and now I'm still on the hunt. Hopefully, someone will see this and save themselves the effort.	negative
Very good quality fabric. Worked well for my little project.	positive
Best product for natural hair that is silk pressed!	positive
These work very well, at any price. I had forgot how my hood was to work under. Shipped quick and worked right	positive
Very nice looking but it does not allow you to adjust the band to tighten it. I can't use it cause it is too big.	negative
only just installed it, but so far I'm enjoying playing it.	positive
Came with all 4 pieces. Very cute! Filled them with helium at the grocery store for minimal cost.	positive
Just received a beat up box with the plastic components and nothing else. No hardware no directions. How do I contact manufacturer to get the parts? I don't want to return it because it's huge.	negative
Just received this and already figured out it won’t work with my case and you can not charge it with an Apple charger, don’t know about the battery. Makes you want to design and go in competition with them.	negative
The feet really feel good! I like balls and rollers! They are a big part of my own physical therapy routine and make me relieve pain.	positive
These lights are fantastic! Much better than I imagined to be honest.	positive
It did the job. But is very delicate , handle with care lol	positive
Great size but smells very bad. I waited some time to see if the smell would go away but had to return	negative
I bought these for a pair of saw horses with metal legs. They fit perfectly and appear to be very sturdy.	positive
I added these to my wedding registry because my goal was to put together a copper kitchen. They are beautiful, shiny, sturdy and have weight to them but unless you can care for them the copper starts to recede after a while so in the end I suspect I'll just have silverware that used to have copper on them.	positive
So i ordered these shoes in October and have never received these shoes yet. I had to contact the seller who had no answers for me and no way to track down. I did get a ref d, but why are they still selling their products on Amazon if nobody receives their products.	negative
So tiny! But I really loved that about these earrings!! But I ended up losing the both of them after a month or two which I was very sad about. The backs constantly fell off, which was it's only downfall.	positive
Not entirely sure about this brand, the first filter filled up or blocked in the first week of use.	negative
I really liked how easy it is to use, however the size does run big so its a little to large for my dog. We measured him before we purchased and it is still to big. It will work, however so i am not upset.	positive
I thought it would be good to get this in portion-controlled packs using carrots and celery sticks. But it was hard to remove the butter without a knife. The butter was dry and grainy.	negative
This book is grittier than my usual fare, but I enjoyed it anyway. Well-drawn characters, a fast-moving, complex plot, and a satisfactory resolution make it well worth the time.	positive
Within 2 months these headphones broke; one earpiece completely fell apart while the other one continues to work. They were wonderful while they lasted but I suggest paying more money for something that will last longer.	negative
So nice, I ordered a second one for my kid.	positive
Ended up having to return it as in spite of many attempts across a number of formats and devices we were ultimately unsuccessful in the account link necessary to use this device.	negative
You get what you pay for	negative
It comes with several things and is very cute. However, the calendar is too small and it's pretty hard, if not impossible, to write any information on it. Plus, it doesn't help that the markers are not thin enough to be able to use on the calendar. Also, half of the markers don't work. I bought a box of ARTEZA dry erase markers and loved them which is why I decided to buy this set but I am not happy at all with it.	negative
Wish I could have given zero stars.... how bad does quality control have to be to send an obviously used item?? Did I purchase a used one? Don't think so. Not sure if it works well, but it sure is adorable. Going to exchange and hope I receive an item that isn't already splattered with wax....🤞	negative
these are really fun, my boys live these! Super fun for Easter!! great buy!!	positive
I feel fancy when I use this. The only downside for me is that it smells like sunscreen.	positive
great charger. beyond my expectations. out-performs the stock plug that is provided by with the phone.	positive
Really good sound quality, even compared to the $100 ones.	positive
These were not my package. Wrong packages delivered	negative
Love it, perfect for my go pro 3+ I don't always want to use the water proof case so ya great deal would buy again!	positive
Although the back heating element doesn't appear to be registering an orange glow of ignition, it's heating and toasting! In fact, I can't imagine if the back heating element flared up at full force. As indicated in an earlier review -- the back heating element is throwing heat, it's just not glowing. The oven gets extremely hot and I'm still learning how to gauge the temperature with trial and error. I've burnt a few chocolate croissants in the process!	positive
The casing that protects the phone if dropped. Shipped in a timely manner and the price was great!	positive
Cheap material.... but looks ok	negative
The socks I was sent were balled up in a plastic bag and taped closed. When I opened them I could smell detergent and they were clearly USED! They are frayed the compression z is almost washed away and the soles are discolored. I am so disgusted. These went straight in the trash. Not happy. Buyer beware.	negative
These are awesome! My boys love them.	positive
This product did not work, the files it produced were corrupted and not readable by any program. Makes me wonder if the positive reviews were real, I don't know how anyone could use this.	negative
It did not work well after 3 months. I would like to talk with seller !	negative
Clips suck but its a good bag	positive

TINY BLANKET!! The picture is deceiving! Would fit a doll bed. Waste of money.	negative
Product does not live up to advertising	negative
Fit perfect in my humidifier attached to my furnace.	positive
The fit of the filters to make the assembly is not very good. Do not like the design. Would rather not have to build up the assembly to use. Only way it stays together is when you put it in the machine !	negative
NEVER REC'D MY BOOK?!!!! NEVER delivered my book. I have video no delivery to my address	negative
It was hard to understand what was being said, not clear with the portrayed accents. Did not like commentary throughout movie. Not at all what I expected from a Statham or Pitt movie.	negative
Cute, but not for me. I returned them	negative
The socks themselves are fine. I had asked if they would fit a 4 year old toddler and was told yes. They wii not fit a toddler.	positive
The pot lid and strainer can in out of the box dented- very disappointing.	negative
I bought these for my infant, and according to the description, they should have fit him. Unfortunately, they were huge and bulky. On top of that, they didn't cancel noise in the least. I have a pretty small head and was able to try them out, as well as my seven-year-old, and both of us agreed that there was very little to no noise reduction when we were wearing these earmuffs. I am returning, and will purchase a better brand in the future.	negative
This app does not provide you with YouTube Kids videos.	negative
Pictures are small not quite what I thought but it is ok	positive
It is a very light stand, but seems well made.	positive
Needs modification. Too many bees drown.	negative
A bit disappointed in this product I purchased for my kids for Christmas. The magnetic chalkboard wasn’t very magnetic, particularly down the middle of the board. I haven’t used it as an actual chalkboard yet so I don’t know how well that will work. But nonetheless this didn’t impress me. Of course the one thing they do provide you with is magnetic letters and numbers, none of which are duplicate so you really can’t spell anything! For the cost of this.... I expected better quality and a bonus or two but I am left disappointed.	negative
I purchased this as a gift for my husband for his father's burial flag however it was shipped in a triangle carton which clearly gave away what was inside along with the label on the outside of the box that said what was inside. So much for the surprise. As for the product itself, it is very nice and the etching is great. Keep in mind that the etching is white/frosted in color and is hard to see once the flag is behind it due to the white stars on the flag.	positive
Great substitute for the GE brand. Product was packaged great and went in easy. No problems with the product. Awesome price.	positive
It is not purple!!!! It is very very blue. When I turn my desk light on it actually changes to a light lavender but in sunlight and regular light it is blue. Much more of a queen than a full size. It is very very soft and quality though. Very comfy, really wish it was more purple. Came on time as well.	positive
I ordered this because I need a simple tool box for around my home office. I did not pay much attention to the size of it before ordering so I was a little shocked at the actual size. It is small, however, it works for my purposes. I occasionally fix a few things around the house and this holds the few screwdrivers, hammer, and wrenches I own.	positive
Its a great shoe, just surprised that after 3 months the lining on both shoes ripped. Disappointed, they didn't last.	negative
I love them but my husband doesn't - lol. I have the blue tint ones but one of the lenses looks like purple, which is why I left 4 stars instead of 5. They came in a soft pouch that will not save these glasses from being crushed but it's better than nothing. Fast shipping.	positive
"sturdy yet light weight - good shooting platform that is easy to set up - I really like the pivoting head. Virtually silent operation is really nice. Only drawback for me is it is still a little short for me if all three legs aren't fully extended (like when on uneven ground), I am 6'1"" tall and have to lean over a little bit under these conditions but it works. Definitely worth the $$."	positive
These covers work out perfectly for our patio furniture set. The price was reasonable as well as the durability for the weather conditions.	positive
makes you think, eye opener	positive
I'm missing lower rack. It wasn't in the box. Manufacturers Specifications say double rack and 3 rack level. Only got one rack in box.	negative
Very good quality cables. We like that they are different set of length. Made from flexible material so should last for long time. We use long cable to charge our Ipad. Work grate for kids they can move around till Ipad charging. Short cable use in a car to charge Iphone so no extra cable next to the driver .	positive
SUPER comfy, like sleeping on a happy cloud.	positive
Worked once then never turned on again	negative
This dress smelled so strongly of plastic that I had to remove it from my house. The description says 95% cotton -- that's really doubtful.	negative
This is not human hair. It tangle from the first day I put it in. It sheds real real bad.	negative
sandpaper worked fine in tough spots to get at	positive
just like the pic and true to size	positive
It's compact size small scale. My wife use this scale when she bake the cookies and some bread. She likes this scale.	positive
Were very quick to help.	positive
Worked great! For 3 weeks. I changed the batteries, and it stopped working. I get get it to beep, but not the dog. I have tried repositioning it multiple times, yet it lets him bark and bark.	negative
fuzzy scarf - very warm. it's thicker than most fashion scarves	positive
This is a terrible product. If you're looking to buy a feather duster, don't buy this one. All the feathers fell out in the first use. Awful quality.	negative
I had this done at an acupuncturist and wanted to be able to try it myself. I've only used these on my shoulders and lower back but the results have been pretty good.	positive
This pad is lightweight, grippy and stylish. Won't slip on you or give you a rash. Everything you need in a stomp pad!	positive
Not good for heavy bikes. Does not support into studs only dry wall.	negative
Nice texture thick but very soft busted in two uses	negative
This broom is nice, it picks up a lot and isn't too heavy or too stiff.	positive
I love these pants so much! After a couple washes it has faded very slightly, and also the top button popped off after the first wash. Not that big of a deal for me because I know how to sew buttons, but may be an inconvenience for some. Overall I really like them!	positive
Worked for a few hours then would stop working and you'd have to unplug it from the wall and plug it in again. Just for it to stop working 10 minutes later.	negative
This is so cute & really helps keep us from tracking leaves & debris inside the house, thanks!	positive
My one year old daughter plays in it you just have to buy the plastic balls by it self	positive
Chaco's are the best. They are ultra comfortable, long lasting, and have many different applications. My wife is a teacher and uses these for work because her school requires open-toe shoes have a heel strap.	positive
Little pricey but dogs like them	positive
It tastes like it hasn’t been sifted. Other brands taste cleaner and better. I can hardly stomach this. Great benefits to my body but it gags me.	negative
The color is perfect for parties.	positive
Very disappointed that 20 either didn't work at all or were very dim or only come on if you squeeze a certain way. That's 1/5 of the 100. I'm a teacher and my students like these in the prize box, but not if they don't work. I wish there was an option to get credit for the nonworking ones without having to send all back.	negative
Super weak, must not be very many grounds in there. Also stale. I bought this because I enjoyed the whole bean bagged version, but it doesn't taste the same.	negative
The first time I've tried monk fruit so can't compare the taste but I'm not a big fan, I'll stick with Stevia.	negative
Cute idea to send to my little ones as a gift for the wedding!	positive
This is the second one I have given as a gift. They are really neat.	positive
Product was nice! Material was light and comfortable. However, I bought it for my aunt as a Christmas present but unfortunately it came with a hole in the seam at the shoulder.	negative
It's just a great key chain and looks awesome	positive
MISSING ALL SCREWS!!! AND PARTS!!! CANT PUT IT TOGETHER WITHOUT THE SCREWS OR PARTS! PRODUCT LOOKED USED WHEN I OPENED IT! THIS WAS A HORRIBLE PURCHASE.	negative
It doesn’t look at the picture at all and all it did was hurt my head	negative
Pencils are ok. Disappointed that all of the pencils arrived out of the box and splayed everywhere in the Amazon padded envelope. Would a piece of tape hurt? How about Amazon QC prior to being sent out? Spent an hour putting them all back in the way I thought they'd arrived.	positive
They are so lovely, love them! Good quality. They look like pictures. They look very strong and like they're going to stay in my hair. The price is good. It's absolutely necessary.	positive
Seems like a quality product, however, did not cover the scrape on my chair.	negative
I was looking for a unique gift for a close friend for a second marriage. The candle was great and arrived quickly. I ordered on Friday, it was shipped Monday and I received it on Thursday. Very impressive for a customized item.	positive
I was not sure about the size but it turned out true to size and looked great with leggings and boots. Love the color combo too.	positive
Great alternative to over priced name brand	positive
My shoe size is 10.5 and it fits perfect. Quality is really nice. Solid color. I m wearing it for office and it fits for formal and casual too.	positive
falls apart pretty quickly	negative
I love how tough the cord is, my daughter can plug in and unplug her Ipad without me worrying she is going to rip the cord. It also charges quickly. Love this charger and will continue to use it	positive
Nice product. Good build instructions. A couple areas that were not finished completely (no stain and/or minor blemishes); otherwise I would have rated a 5.	positive
Too pricey and first day a sink hole from the chair appeared and still there	negative
The chair is made out of garbage quality material, the arm broke on me the first day I had it and the legs all snapped less than a year later.	negative
I gave this to my elderly parents and they loved it. It's light weight and easy to maneuver. Even though they decided not to travel they refused to return the product!	positive
Pro: Makes cutting job easy. Works well. I cut almost all vegetables in this and am glad I bought it. I Cons: 1. You have to cut vegetables to about 2x2 inch size first before using this. 2. Cleaning is hard. There is a mesh on the top(inside that green top), onion peels and vegetables get stuck there and I have to use a knife to pry them out. If you are cutting one onion, I woudl rather cut with my knife. But if there are lots of vegetables I use this thing.	positive
This baptism towel is great! It is big enough for an adult and it is very soft. I used it for a family baptism and it was just right! The embroidery on it is very nice as well.	positive
according to size chart these should have fit. about 2 sizes too small.	negative
i like the smell of this product. I used it for my dog.	positive
Returned. Bad quality.	negative
These shears are awesome! They are very sharp. They make pruning so much easier. I love that I got 2 pairs for the price of one. One pair I use for outdoor use. The other pair I keep in my kitchen.	positive
I would have given 5 stars overall as the goggles are great, fit well, no glare, and great in the sun. However, the rubber is burning on the skin. I did let try other family members and they had the same burn around the areas - with and without sunscreen. Will switch to Arena and see how those work out.	negative
All I did was try them on and they got a hole. Disappointed- I was really looking forward to wearing these to an event	negative
The bands are not true to size. I am a personal trainer and use these types of bands often. These bands were too big and won't work for any size person because the resistance is not enough.	negative
I liked that this lifted my butt but it didn’t stay up without rolling. It fits smaller and I even ordered a bigger size.	negative
Love the shoes. Very comfortable and easy to clean. Shoes do squeak.	positive
I love these pans! I bought them to make personal pizzas are they are amazing!!!	positive
A cool design add to any space. I bought all the options and put them around the house. It’s a nice way to bring green life to your place in style	positive
Perfect fit and at a GREAT price!!!!!	positive
I ordered the blue case and even paid extra because I wanted a new product not used. I ended up receiving the orchid grey with damaged packaging along with the scan bar on the packaging saying blue case. I tried to like it but I couldn't stop thinking about how I paid extra for the blue case and ended up with the orchid grey. The advertisement also said you can work on your phone with the flip closed. That's not true. The only thing you can do is swipe the alarm when it goes off.	negative
Good size and material. I'm using it as a side table for my outdoor lounges and it works perfectly.	positive
This product, fits perfect for my Xs max. And my,every day use. Love the grip and feel. It is not as bulky as some products. And looks great. The kick stand is is also great. Buttons work great, no trouble with value off and on buttons. Fits the phone perfect.	positive
They look and feel nice.	positive
This is just printed on colored printer paper. Single sided. For $8 I'd expect more.	negative
The package was very damaged and so was the product ... very disappointed!!	negative
Should have returned it but it came to late. Does not work good	negative
These were cheap and bright, so good value. However it doesn't have the most secure mounting tabs. The light blue mounting tabs are rubber so it's kinda loose in the housing. Otherwise these are good. 4/5 for that.	positive
Very long , not good	negative
Cheap fabric and the sizing guide is a joke. I returned it on my own dime and had to follow up a month later to get my money back.	negative
Not universal, does not fit Martha Stewart essentials cast iron. I tried to cut the skinny area to allow the bigger end to slide on, it worked a little. We will use this weekend while camping, but they will go in the trash when we get home. If these fit your pans they would be nice. They do what they are expected to	negative
Bought this in May 2018, died August 2018. Would be nice if we could be sent a replacement free of charge.	negative
Using product to monitor RO system mineral supplementation cartridge. Very accurate compared to water laboratory results. Easy to use out of the box.	positive
great case just wish it protected the phone a little more. also it's a little hard to open.	positive
These haircutting scissors are PERFECT for a quick trim or hair cut. They are sharp, easy to handle and come with a wonderful case so that no one grabs them for cutting paper or ribbons!	positive
Shipped in a box 5 times to big and despite packaging not being damaged the roll was creased in multiple locations. At least I got the toolkit that many others didn't	negative
An absolutely beautiful deck. The cards are perfect and the box is a work of art in itself. My big let down is the state of my box lining... the red insert was torn in two places at the top of the cards. Not the kind of quality I expect from a new deck of cards.	positive
Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.	negative
I thought I was reordering the same product I purchased three years ago but the formula has changed and the color is totally different. Furthermore you can't return it!	negative
The muzzle I received doesn't have a wire basket or leather straps--- it's plastic with fabric straps	negative
My puppy LOVES these balls!	positive
Returned this product. Lack of clear directions. Complicated to use.	negative
We bought two for our boys for Christmas. Sadly one wouldn’t work after he first two minutes no matter how much we charged the battery and brand new batteries not the remote. We are buying another in hopes we can have two that work. We have no clue how or why it stopped worked instantly. The directions didn’t really help either as to trouble shooting what the issue is. One bummed out 3 year old.	negative
This don't work in my Chevy cobalt SS	negative
This is MAGIC! With the snow melting and the ground becoming soft, this is my new favorite 'accessory'! It's as simple as dipping the dog's paws in 2-3 times each (or as many as you'd like) to remove the mud/dirt and the bristles inside are soft and do not irritate the dog's paws. It's so much easier to wipe his feet dry instead of trying to wipe all the mud off each time he comes inside. I highly recommend this product.	positive
I've used this product on all my dogs and never had a flea or tic problem. I don't live in a forest so I can't promise it works there but I have a big back yard with mosquitoes at night. They come in and none are scratching or itching like me from mosquito bites. Maybe I should wear one too. lol	positive
The Bamboo Tumbler Cup tea bucket is a little too shallow for brewing tea wish it was a little deeper.	positive
The acting was weak. The worst part is the story line. The plot wasn't twisted , keep you guessing .... it was a train wreck. Very disappointing.	negative
Great so far. I am concerned with it having a great deal of plastic though. So far love it! Hose is metal so that is a huge plus.	positive
The pads are hard and don't conform to the curves in my back. I thought they would be soft material.	negative
Received damaged goods from seller, and contacted them but never received response. Will not buy again from this seller.	negative
This is made of low quality material....not flattering or very professional. I am not by any means an overweight person and it will not allow me to return the item.....don’t buy this item it’s a huge waste of money	negative
USB does not work with 2 devices.	negative
Exactly what’s advertised	positive
Pulls you in and never lets you go!	positive
I really love that this product is chemical free way to get rid of unwanted pests.	positive
As others have said, it stopped working after a month. Never immersed in water, just rinsed it. Change the batteries twice already but still not working. Poor quality.	negative
Not my team but bought for a friend Nd it was not long enough on the sides	positive
It did the job, but the shaft could have been longer as I have long locks	positive
Much smaller than pictured. 1/4 the size.	negative
Some worked well. While the sticky part of some others came off and are useless	negative
My kids loved this until they dropped it once and the bottom part broke open and all the little crystals got scattered throughout my house, would not repurchase	negative
Wow. Just three time I was trying to pull the sucker and it breaks. .z	negative
Good product, worked well	positive
seems to be a good 10 speed chain, have not torqued it heavily yet, but one of the few long link chains.	positive
Great gifts for the kids in my little girl's class.	positive
We love it! Very happy with this product.	positive
Disappointed in its performance on a 3 year old electric stove oven.. maybe I expected more, but wouldn’t purchase it again...	negative
This product often does not work with the iPhone X. Typically when I try to use it, I get an error message saying the device is not supported.	negative
Do waste time or money. Ordered in apricot but received a gray shirt which is not even a color choice when buying. Material is cheap. Size is small. The print is smeared.	negative
It wouldn't prime for me. I had to put it under water to get it to prime. Once it was primed I could only get a few gpm to come out. I wasn't trying to pump the water far. I had a 6 ft hose and I was trying to pump it down hill. Siphoning the water ended up working better for me at least I didn't have to stand there holding a drill.	negative
Arrived broken. Returned.	positive
very, very dim light. will be returning	negative
I am really in love with this skillet. It is very easy to clean. I was so skeptical to buy that the cast iron cooking is not so easy when it comes to the cleaning part. But this skillet proved me wrong. The cleaning is easy cooking is easy and I even deep fried some recipe. The quality is amazing. Just follow the tips after cleaning rubbing it with little oil helps to prevent rusting. Five stars	positive
"I'm not sure how this product has anything but 1 star. The original refills are blue... these are green... you can tell they are of lower quality. Doesn't clean as well, doesn't produce as much ""soap"" suds... terrible. Amazon needs to pull these"	negative
Light, easy to fold and carry and thick!	positive
Broke two days after first use and I'm gentle with small electronics.	negative
I was shorted a blue one. I received 21 white 18 red 18 yellow 17 blue	negative
Nice for a young collector	positive
waste of money .my dog break it in one second.	negative
Gloppy, goopy, and gross it seems like it's old or, maybe this is just the way this mascara is supposed to be, in any case, I won't be buying it ever again. It is very difficult to apply without a ton of mascara blobs all over the place. For $20 I can find a mascara I'm in love with not this junk. I do NOT recommend.	negative
Bought two. 1 has never worked..the 2nd worked for two weeks	negative
I bought this fan last year and it stop working a month ago. This is the second Honeywell product I have bought that doesn't work well.	negative
Great product from a great company.	positive
I love this thing! Setup is simple. Just turn on, select the type of meat, and sit back until it gets to temp! The wireless monitor is what really drew me to this one, and I have not had any issues with it connecting to the thermometer. I can be in the living room watching TV and always know how well the meat is cooking without getting up to keep checking!	positive
Very upset about the shampoo and conditioner I received. My conditioner had a broken nozzle and the shampoo has leaked all over the packaging... I love this product, but disappointed on how I received it.	negative
Suit fits good. A little worried about the girls falling out. But we will see how it goes when I wear it on vacation.	positive
Flimsy product. Even with use of anchors, this cheap piece of junk would not stay in the wall. Drilled into studs, it simply fell out over and over.	negative
Only problem is one of the ceramic inserts arrived with an indent on it that doesn't belong. Not going to return because too much hassle. They're really cute and look as expected.	positive
Seems like poor quality. It took forever to get, but it did say that it would. My daughter still gave it as part of a gift, but I wouldn’t purchase it again.	negative
My screen certainly cracked using this case. Dont buy it	negative
More pink than red.....not as dark as they look.....glows well	positive
I love the vest! I labeled it as tight, however, it could be tight or snug depending on what size you get! I have not had any issues with the vest.	positive
This is the slowest waffle iron ever. Takes about 20 minutes for each set of 2 and they aren't even that dark. No adjustable settings.	negative
Would give 4.5 if possible! It’s just perfect for our new place and our cat! Wobbles a little more than I imagined when she gets wild playing on it, but with the tension rod there’s no chance of it tipping. Love!	positive
This is an amazingly supportive book..TThis book contains essential things that you should know and find out about Instant pot supernatural cooking style. It has huge amounts of various alternatives. The creator has conveyed every single uncommon element of this kitchen gadget and she is so splendid in making this she called essentially scrumptious ordinary formulas. She has clarified likewise which nourishment blend are most appropriate for your moment pot. You will unquestionably feel extraordinary in the event that you have a duplicate of this cookbook...I recommened this book..!	positive
great stress and anxiety relief, good for chronic pain as well.	positive
Nice towels and great color!!! They were a gift and the recipient loves them! They're perfect!!	positive
This was my second set of refills.	positive
Screws keep coming undone but falls apart.... have to retighten screws and stop working every 10 mins	negative
was exactly as described. my g/f loved ir	positive
I really like the design of this water bottle, but it started leaking the second time I used it. I had to throw it away and buy a different product.	negative
Ordered a king size. It was a little snug. Very comfortable.	positive
We found a vintage Penn Yan Canoe and wanted to store it as a display piece in our home. This lift was the best option and worked very well and easy to assemble and install.	positive
Not as rich and flavorful as we had hoped.	negative
I purchased these to replace a similar pair of dockers sandals that I had for years and loved. Sadly they have regressed over the years and the quality just isn’t what it used to be. The most notable part is the Velcro used to close the sandals. They now use Velcro that barely closes and on top of that they use just a tiny amount of it. So the sandals come loose and open up frequently. Sad since the old sandals were so fantastic.	negative
The led light worked great to clean my sons ear until it stopped working. I charges it for 3 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours and NOTHING light barley works. It does light up is it is plugged in (so not very useful). Picked this product over other because it looked better quality. Guess I was wrong I am returning this product	negative
As a true fan of MC romances (my guilty pleasure) I purchased this book based on the positive reviews. I don't get it. The story line was weak and over done, and the characters were immature and not believable. The writing was just not good. This book could have been helped by even the minimal amount of editing. I really hate to leave poor reviews, but I am embarrassed that I paid for this book. There are so many better MC series in KU.	negative
This is not a bad switch. Just a bit a false advertising here. Only 1 ships.	negative
They say they fit my car and although the front ones do the rear ones do not FIT not even close	negative
My expectations were high but they were met. Good material. I bought it for my friend. She is 5’6 150 pounds and I get a medium.	positive
Same light quality and brightness as our 100W halogens, which last little more than a year. Good build quality on these lamps, fit in our sconce lamp sockets as expected. Highly recommended.	positive
This is the second pillowcase I’ve purchased so far. Love them!	positive
I’m not very tall so the boots looked way to big for me	negative
I love love love this product! This product replaced 3 round canisters in my pantry. I will be ordering this product again. And yes it is air tight & easy to clean.	positive
"It was easy to install and it all looks great, but I am missing a pipe one of the 12"" pipes. Unfortunately, I did not notice until I had everything else screwed into the wall. I have tried contacting the seller to just get another pipe sent, but I have still not heard back, so I can either take the entire thing down and send it back for a return, or I can buy a pipe myself. Other than that it is great, but I dont see myself ever ordering from the seller again."	negative
"They are smaller than I thought they would be, but this is only my first time buying boxes. I got the 2"" x 3"" x 4"" ones. They're a bit hard to assemble but I'm learning. Great for smaller packages and parts."	positive
Not sure why Amazon asks for noise cancelation rating bc I don't think that's the point of these curtains. They're pretty well made and block out light very well. However, I was hoping for a little better heat blocking.	positive
Good quality material, Fast shipping, Perfect!!	positive
Battery died after 3 weeks. Doesn't pick up people walking right up to it but goes off for no reason all the time. Sadly giving it a month to try has moved my past returning the product but I figured it was me and played with the settings every which way possible and still just a blah experience for spending that much money. Not happy. To be fair, when it works the picture and sound quality is amazing but that doesnt matter if it doesnt work.	negative
The mask is vary small. Would fit a kid or small adult.	negative
I love the vibrant colors. Glad I can put it in the wash to clean it. It protects my hard luggage from being beat up.	positive
Already broken within 4 months	negative
I literally bought headphones and they sent me a pack of chargers? extremely confused, 0/10 would not recommend	negative
Used this for my DIY Halloween outfit. Went perfectly. Came in good condition & it fitted nicely! I will be buying more from this grand! It was warm, cute and sexy!	positive
I can’t get a external hard drive to work with this product! I’ve tried everything I can guess that’s money lost don’t waste your money on this!	negative
This is the best lip balm ever. I used 4 of them as stocking stuffers. Within 2 weeks, everyone who received one was telling me that it is the best lip balm they had ever used. I feel the same about the one I gave to myself!	positive
WHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS?!	negative
Arrived in perfect condition! Great quality. Can’t wait to use these in my classroom!	positive
I just love Groot and I collect banks, so that makes it all the better!!!	positive
It depends on personal taste, but if you prefer a more inflated pad than some of the other brands, this would be a good fit.	positive
This dress is very poorly made	negative
I love this. I am using it to display some Christmas decorations and I was extremely surprised by the quality. Much better than I expected for the price.	positive
Bottle is messy .. soo much wasted because of this bottle . I brought before different brand that is better than now brand quality...	negative
Works great ... easy to install and looks awesome.	positive
This is a superb devotional I am a connoisseur of devotionals and this is one of the best I’ve ever read Brian and Michelle did their due diligence and pointing us to Jesus and to referencing all of the places in the series that they could and the lessons learned I would recommend this to anyone it is beautiful inside and out ! Well done!	positive
Tore after not even 12 hours. Felt pretty tight going on so maybe it's too small for a Nissan 3500 cargo van? Either way it tore after not even 12 hours.	negative
Probably works good. Got it four my wife, she never uses it	negative
Great product for tracking my fitness. I am a girl who want to keep fit, I like do sport, running, summing, walking and so on. I used to judge my exercise only by feeling, but now I can know how much I exercise exactly. It can tell me how many steps I walked, how much calories I burned and how long I have walked.	positive
I really like how well this picks up the cat hair but it is a bit difficult to open but that would not hinder me to buy again.	positive
too difficult to set wake up time and emits too much blue light at night which is poor for sleep quality	negative
I am giving this golf pen set as a gift to mu 5 years old brother whom I haven't met before. So O wanted something unique and special for him. So I think that this golf set pen is not only good for him now but would be good for a long term. This set is can be rally fun while studying and playing as well while being bored. I would say that It's of quality material and good to play with this one.	positive
bad quality broke the next day	negative
I found out you have to mount the antenna almost horizontally to get it to work. I have a large overhang and the mount I bought ended up putting the antenna at about a 30 degree angle. Couldn't get any stations at all. So I started playing with the antenna and as soon as I got it horizontal I got signal. So I modified my antenna mount to get it horizontal and it works fine now	positive
This is exactly what I wanted. It hides the sight of the liter, traps the smell and contains the liter with the box so no mess!	positive
Much smaller than I expected	negative
The way it snaps is very nice.	positive
The fabric is light & cool, it seems well-made, and fits almost perfectly. The docked ⭐️ is for two reasons: I can’t imagine this as one-size-fits-all (it’s almost too short, and I’m not a tall person so my arms aren’t very long); and the black one bled dye on everything it touched after *three* thorough washings. 🤞 for the fourth try.	positive
It really added comfort to my mattress. I wish it wrapped more down the sides with the quilting, but I knew this when I purchased.	positive
Thought this would be the missing ingredient. My daughter hates it. I'm not thrilled with it. We dislike the lemony flavor.	negative
This is not a good product to buy from Amazon because of the fact I had a return request or replacement I bought a warranty and Amazon or warranty department have not replied to my request yet it has been 3 days please do not buy this item	negative
Can early a perfect fixed	positive
These little knee pads slip & slide but worst is they ride down & are not useful as knee pads.	negative
Worked for about 2 weeks n it went dry on me. Cap was always on. And it went dry.	negative
I enjoyed this book. It has strong,and intelligent characters. I really look forward to reading more books by this author.	positive
This is far too expensive. I receive bags that are marked $1 per bag and pay over $4. I enjoy them but not for the price.	negative
Fits well with three small kids in the back seat. Hard to keep inflated after a while.	positive
I like this Jewelry cabinet/mirror a lot, but I am disappointed that I cannot recess it in the wall and still lock it. I stored it and moved it with me so I am beyond my return window now. The lock is on the side right in the center of the side of the cabinet so it will not work when recessed in a wall. It does not have nice trim to hang in a room or bathroom, but would work in a closet or someplace most people do not see.	negative
Don’t buy this. Have had for a week so far, has 0 output. Have had better tea lite candle lit oil burners! Waste!!	negative
My dogs are begging for more all day long. They love them. Can’t get enough	positive

Have only been using it for a week but so far am pleased. My mouth feels clean and healthy. Will review again after longer use. Thanks Primal Life!	positive
I used it for my daughters graduation and it was really comfortable	positive
The product adds a little volume, but the hold is terrible, and my hair will fall flat as soon as I leave the bathroom. If I try to use more product I just rip out more hair not sure why but every time I style with this product my hair pulls out.	negative
It's good for the price, sound quality is not as good as I expected, however it's fair, looks very nice, materials are good, comfortable ear pads.	positive
One tube was virtually empty so the product wasn’t usable. Have used this product in the past and never had a problem before.	negative
Arrived on time. All alive. Will purchase again!	positive
I purchased this supplement for my PCOS. When they arrived I took one that afternoon and later that night when I was trying to go to sleep I found it very difficult to catch my breath. This went on for several hours and I had trouble falling asleep that night. Against my better judgment, I took another pill this morning and while at work, again I had trouble catching my breath. Nothing in my diet or routine has changed other than this supplement. Will be returning.	negative
For the price I expected it to be much lower quality. I only use a duty belt a few times a month and did't want to pay much for something I rarely use. The pouches are easy to move where you want them and stay where you put them. I would recommend a trouser belt as it tends to ride up otherwise	positive
I got what I asked for. It fits my adult sized head. At first it looked small so I wouldn’t stretch it too far. Hard to center. Fits over my wig 😛	positive
These are super comfortable and cute! I love it! My only issue is that the fake leather is a little noisy when you walk and move you're feet.	positive
Item was delivered on time	positive
I have been having trouble with my moods as of late, and I wanted to avoid taking anything non natural. I figured I would give this a try, and I can honestly say, I notice a difference. I feel better, happier, and if I pair it with a melatonin, I sleep quicker. I missed a dosage, and I could tell the difference. I was highly impressed with how well this worked. Its not a magical cure all, but it provides the boost i need most of the time	positive
Didn't work for my Grandson.	negative

Does not work, bought two and regret purchase. DO NOT BUY	negative

The wallet is definitely streamlined, however, the stitching for the pull tab has already come loose after 2 weeks. This was one of the main reasons I chose this wallet for the easy access to my cards via pull tab.	negative

This book will give the insight into being everything that you ever wanted to be and having the success in life that will enable you to live the life you deserve.

Extremely disappointed in these. Definitely do not appear to be 'hand-painted' nor is there really an ombre effect. These look just like the cheap version available for more than $20 less.	negative
I ordered these for my sons classroom. They a great value for kids. I tried a set and the sound quality is pretty poor and the quality of the product is cheap. The real value comes in the quantity of earbuds yoi receive. Must buy for younger children who break or lose the more expensive earbuds.	positive
I am a plus size woman and ordered a 3xxx but it's pretty tight, not nearly as loose as I'd like. Also, the sleeves aren't red and black. The red color is actually more of a hot pink which was very disappointing. I will keep it but I'm not real happy with it.	negative
These sandals are cool looking and really comfortable, and they do run a little big (even for me, and I'm hard to fit with a high instep and wide feet). My teenage son immediately swiped the pair that I ordered, so when I re-order, I'll go a little smaller to fit ME better.	positive
Great but faded quickly	positive
The lumbar support piece broke off after a few months of use, for the price I would have expected this chair to last a lot longer	negative
Sticky Lips up on front barely attached not attached all the way	negative
Very beautiful and colors go with everything! Great addition to my very limited jewelry collection!	positive
This item is ok for what it does and I need for added support.	positive
looks good feels good let's see if it holds up and it's acts good.	positive
This is a must have book. Your kids will love it!!!	positive
Was easy to program and worked fine for 6 months, and then it died.	negative
First week of using the eyeglasses from this vendor, so far they are comfortable and serve the purpose.	positive
Looks like a toy and if you use this, your expensive Mac will definitely look like some cheap quality toy laptop.Also the pink sleeve is completely a dull shiny pink in real. Product does not look the same as in picture. I had to return back this item.	negative
It didn’t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn’t show in the picture	negative
I needed a cookie rack and this was a perfect fit! I like that the legs are short enough so that it fits nicely in a cookie sheet or as is on the counter. The rack is sturdy and holds a decent amount of cookies. I haven’t experienced any rust with washes either. I did notice the rack warped slightly with one end slightly higher in the air but still worked well and the cookies came out picture perfect!	positive
my rhizomes were seized by customs. I would like my money back. all i received was an empty envelope!	negative
From first use, these left tiny black dots all over the area I was blending. I do not recommend these at all!	negative
One stopped working after a few weeks and the other 3 stopped working in less than two months. Very disappointed.	negative
Heavy duty. Appears nice but did not work for my application (Logitech Harmony Hub- jack too large)	positive
Did not like the material. Very stiff. Also the strap lock is very hard to secure in place. You have to pull-up really hard to remove it.	negative
Fit is good. The non-slip nubs initially feel a little strange but after several minutes I really don't notice them. They are nonslip. I wear a size 14 shoe.	positive
My mother had a weed-wacker sitting in the barn, been there 3 or 5 or 7 years, she didn't know. For the price of this kit it was worth trying to see if it would run. I am no mechanic, but it took me 30 min to put the new carb on and spark-plug. The weed-wacker runs like it was brand new.	positive
I got this for my boyfriend and he hated it! He’s used lots of pre workouts before and this one didn’t benefit him not one bit. He mentioned the flavor was a bit good but it never did what pre workouts are supposed to do. He would never buy this and he’s been working out for years.	negative
These also fit the fitbit Blaze, very nice 14 years super happy with them ..	positive
Very nice cup. What I didn't like was how hard the printing is to read. I had to look at the print under a bright light just to read it. It was a gift and she also had a hard time reading it.	positive
I'm a sixty-year-old man and have had allergy issues all my life. Nothing has ever worked until this. Not only does it take away my symptoms quickly, it also keeps them away.	positive
The pillow is cute and soft. It’s my fault for not paying attention to the size. It’s so small. Could be a throw pillow on my toddlers bed. I’m not giving all stars because honestly the price for the size of this pillow is ridiculous, especially having to also purchase a pillow case for the same price.	positive
These work as advertised. Didn’t even have to email customer service like so many others said they had to do. I took my time, installed the app, checked everything before I mounted it and it connected immediately once I mounted it to my Facia board on my house. The only reason I took off a star is for having to tear it apart to put a sd card in the camera. Other then that, great picture and good app so far. I bought two of them and it’s very easy to add in additional cameras.	positive
It was cute for the prize but the fabric was to thin	negative
The selling point on this watering device is that everything can be controlled through the app and it is smart, so it varies based on weather. However, the nearest weather station to us was not very close, so our rainfall measurements were always off, which means that sometimes it watered as it was raining. Also multiple times the app refused to save the changes we had made. So you think you schedule watering or disable a particular zone only to go back days later and discover it has completely lost the changes. Very frustrating.	negative
Can't believe this cheap piece of plastic carp costs $40. Complete rip off.	negative
Good product. I would recommend to use this when our eyes seem to get tired and become sensitive.	positive
1 spacer was missing. Had to make a run to Lowes. Took quite some time to assemble, align the screws and such Other than that worked out ok 3 weeks in....love this product	positive
As described, this is for beginner to mild intermediate. I started using when muscles were really tight. Now that they are much looser, I do feel that this one is a little soft. However, for the price it did it's job and I still occasionally use it when I tighten up...	positive
Feels like it’s always falling out of your ear	negative
Way too small and not well made. The bow fell right off. I usually wear a two sizes smaller than I ordered and this didn't fit.	negative
Too thin to be used as a hot pad. Heat goes right through the thin rubber.	negative
Beautiful color but fits a little snug for size. And material is a matte finished Chiffon not much give.	positive
I really like my new wallet, it holds all those pesky cards without bulking up. I find the one I want at first glance, the two long zipper pockets hold cash, whatever you want, a spare key, phone, flat items. I would give 5 stars if there was a wrist strap or a ring to attach one to. Love the colors and affordability, and ease of use, especially for senior citizens, shaky hands, arthritis, no hand strength. It's young and fresh looking, fun to reach for it, finally!	positive
This is a great case. I love that they had a few different designs to choose from and most of all I love that the bumpers are substantial. I even bought a hard shell case that is pretty sturdy but its bumpers are not even as good as this one. It also is pretty thin everywhere else so it easily fits into my pocket. Great Case for my Galaxy 7 Edge!	positive
I really can't leave a review on the product at this time... I just started taking the product and it is too early to tell as far as is it helping me or not... I will give updated review in a couple of weeks... as for delivery and packaging and follow up, the company has done a good job with that, that is why I gave four stars...	positive
Love this charger. In half an hour my iPhone X is fully charged. It's nice to look at and it is also pretty durable, I've dropped it from the kitchen and bathroom counter without any problem. I highly recommend this style of charger. Don't be alarmed that it gets pretty warm, that's normal and nothing to worry about.	positive
I love things in their place and now our garage is organized too! This is a great purchase for the balls, helmets, bats, sticks, etc.	positive
I used these with my Android phone. I like how they fit in my ears; they're very comfortable. They have very good sound.	positive
have bought in the past and will again.	positive
The deer has glasses on. You can’t really tell in the pictures unless you zoom	negative
It was what I needed at a good price.	positive
Didn't fit correctly.	negative
So wasn't sure what to expect with this shoe. Does have a rubber sole with some cushioning. I wasn't expecting the design to just be painted on a thin white canvas (?) material. It's a cool design. I don't think they would last long. I bought a sz 9 as i wear inserts. With inserts it pinched across the top of my foot. Also in just wearing barefoot it dimpled on top where my toes were, cause of the thin material.	negative
Game doesn't work. We keep having issues trying to get it to play.	negative
I love the design, love the look but unfortunately after only 6 months of use, the tension arm that holds the paper towels in place broke off. It wasn't from use/abuse, I don't even use paper towels that often - maybe a couple times a week.	negative
These work pretty good for carrying an extra mag. Pics shows Glock 19 15 round mag and a 24 round mag. Goes all the way done. Snug fit once pushed all the way in. Metal Clip is nice and strong. Material is a neoprene type and is comfortable. My only real complaint is getting a good purchase on mags that don't stick out further than the lip but for the price they will do just fine.	positive
Does Parts on it are cheap	negative
Very disappointed upon receiving this. Surface scratched. Will be returning!	negative
I bought this for our 2yr old. It's perfect, just as described!	positive
I like the S9 case for the butterfly graphics. It is very thin and fits well in the pockets of my clothes. The denim feel of the case is also a nice feature to keep the phone from sliding out of my pockets. I did not get the Dust Plug in the package, which I did check thoroughly. I was not sure who to contact so I just regarded it as nonessential.	positive
Prompt shipping, product itself is nice, functional.	positive
As I'm presently in the process of self-publishing my first book, this book is heaven-sent. I'd been painstakingly learning the ropes, researching left and right, but when I stumbled on this manual, things got so much easier: all the info I needed, concentrated in one place, clearly presented, with practical, up-to-date hints and examples. It's seen a long time since I've been inspired and put at ease like this. Now I feel that I can do this--with confidence! I'm truly grateful.	positive
VERY SHORT BATTERY LIFE	negative
The instructions say to cut them down to size. I did this but after that, they worked only intermittently and go off any time they are jarred by my dog running. I had to throw it out and it makes me mad because I needed something like this.	negative
stopping working in less a year	negative
I would have given it a 5 star, but it bleeds on everything. I have washed it a few times but haven’t seen a difference. Also not sure if there is a correlation, but since using the pillow cases I have started breaking out on the side of the face that lays on the pillow. Other than that, it’s soft.	positive
Pretty. Arrived wrinkled, and i just hung anyway thinking it would smooth out, although it hasn’t. Maybe i’ll Iron it with a low iron when i bring it back in.	positive
Cancel order, was going to take way too long for the Delivery, coming from India	negative
Stuck on level 356 and can't move on. I know all the words but it is impossible to get to them. I can only get 3 of them. I tried all different ways. I think this puzzle is defective. Someone please help!	positive
Loooks nice. Soft fabric. Material is just as expected. Well worth the money.	positive
My dog normally devours any bully stick in minutes, he loves them. He would not touch these. Smelled them and literally walked away. Not sure why but we did notice these had a crimson red color which we have never seen with other bully sticks.	negative
I was under the impression that my order was coming in a tin box as advertised however it wasn’t in a tin box!!! I suggest that if the item isn’t what it is as advertised give the customers options to whether to purchase or not inform customers that that particular item isn’t coming the way they assumed it to be!!	negative
Product arrived in good time. The packaging was such that the product wasn’t damaged during shipping and I am satisfied with my purchase. It works for my needs. Five stars.	positive
Cute golden wallet for my niece. Bought it for her birthday present. It has cute little charm. Holds cash & coins well. She really loved it. Made me very happy!	positive
Sound went out after 5 months. Very disappointed.	negative
It looks very realistic. It is kinda hard to put on but totally worth is after you put it on. I wish they sold different piece because you might have one piece open and you would need to buy another ten	positive
My daughter has a weird obsession with trains so I bought this so she could see one up close. She absolutely loves this thing. We also use rechargeable batteries in it and have yet to have to recharge them even though it's played with so much. If this one breaks i'll definitely be replacing it.Shipped quick and a beautiful little train.	positive
It was fake logo, did not like the print it looked poor	negative
Bought 30 of these. At least 10 went bad. Some in the first week of use. Not sure what the point of LEDs are if they don't last...	negative
The book was good but I did not know I was reading a miniseries I did not like the way it you had to buy the series	negative
Accidentally ordered two and it would not allow me to cancel one. This was for a gift and now I am stuck with an additional one	positive
Sometimes it does not recognize my iPhone and I have to unplug and replug. I have that same problem with my earphones.	negative
I have one for home and one for work, so far they have lasted and the magnet is strong enough.	positive
This is the 3rd time I have to these shoes because they fit very small. I believe they will be comfortable once I get the right size.	negative
Got it strung and started to fall apart didnt even get to shoot it once	negative
Broken after 1 year of light use, doesn't pressurize anymore.	negative
color is more of an orange/red	negative
Well it took a few tries but installed them in the wall. Only problem was finding the right spot in the wall to hang these. The price I found was the best anywhere. The hooks are pretty strong they look amazing and no body can tell what they are for until I show them. Its a nice surprise.	positive
I entertain a lot so keeping high quality crackers in the pantry makes whipping up an appetizer so much easier!	positive
It was ok. Kinda predictable. But I read it all the way through. It’s an easy read in a few afternoons.	negative
Great book and a very fast read. I have already purchased the second book in the series. Various intrigue, treason, murder and more	positive
The brass is durable but the orings are not the strongest of items which is annoying as it’s very crucial. I would not invest in buying too many of these until the manufacturer provides a list of bottles it fits or they provide various orings with a range of thicknesses. I will need to go to the hardware store to replace the poor orings and to find a way to make their product work.	negative
This product gave my cat a nasty allergic reaction that required me to bring him to the vet. Watch your cat for 24 hours after you apply. You would think that bear would have figured this out to make it less toxic to animals but nobody seems to care today anyway	negative
definitely works great for mosquitos. I have not been bitten since installing 2 of these in the garage. would be nice if these detoured moths that tend to mass in the garage when i am on there working with the lights on.	positive
Not heavy enough. Very thin glass. Easy to break. I would love these in a heavier weight.	negative
Ordered a Second Batch	positive
as described very satisfied.	positive
Very easy to use, shipped fast Absolutely will recommend ,	positive
Pretty and dainty! Little snug!	positive
I’ve been using the brow wiz for years but ordered it for the first time through Amazon. I used it once and then it broke in half.	negative
I'm 5'1 and the extra small fits but a little long. Still my favorite leggings!	positive
It doesn't work for cleaning a bathroom Am protecting you from fumes	negative
After the first night of using this plugged in by my bedside table, I woke up displeased to find my phone's battery was dead. The charger does not insert into my iPhone 7 well at all. When I am successful in positioning the phone right, it charges very slow and my phone will not hold its charge. I do not recommend this cheap product.	negative
Sometimes has a lot of glare on photos, sun will trigger it but over all a ok camera	positive
Works well, but not for the flex. I gave it to my neighbor.	positive
Wow! Super bright! I only need to use one bulb in all of my multi bulb ceiling fans and lights.	positive
Not what I expected at all thin and tears easy	negative
It's more lip sticky feel than the airy one, but the color lasts! If you eat or drink you will need to reapply though. The color is a bit more orangey than I thought it would be.	positive
Love these boots. Very comfortable, and a great price. I would (and already have) recommend these to a friend. Good for hiking and nice and warm.	positive
I ordered their product and it arrived quickly and performed as expected. However, a week or so goes by and the swivel clip breaks, ☹. Contacted Fogeek about issues and they sent out a replacement item quickly! Once again satisfied with product AND their Customer Service. 😁	positive
Very light weight and it heat up pretty fast. Curling/straighting workes. My only complain was that it did not have a lock feature on the clamp, so you need a strong hold.	positive
Love, only wish there was a rubber lining inside to hold them from sometimes rolling down.	positive
Got this shirt for my 5 year old daughter and she LOVES it!!! Washed it one time and still looks good :)	positive
Great curtains for the price, only problem is getting the creases out. Even after a wash and dry, and a dry with a wet towel, and a warm iron you can still see them. Otherwise great.	positive
The ground doesn't fit into the pens hole but even if it did the port on th inside is covered. Cannot take it apart ev n though that is a claim in the description.	negative
Would get 5 stars if the inside was bigger, some plates barely fit but other than that it works great.	positive
The leg is not slim. There is a substantial bell to this bootcut.	negative
The screw on top can really hurt	negative
COq10 is a must have for anyone looking to keep their heart healthy, I've been using this brand for a few months and it's been good for me.	positive
Not for me. I tried to get ingredients list before buying - I was allergic to some ingredients. I gave it to a neighbor	negative
The stand is good but the screen protector is broken when I opened it. I gave it two star Because I have to ship the whole thing back as per amazon. It’s just an inconvenience to box it up and ship it out again! Also I have to wait another two days for another one!	negative
Stayed distracted by spelling and grammar mistakes. This could have been a whole lot more readable had someone taken the time to proofread .	negative
I could barely fit it on the soda can, but when I did, it was impossible to remove it. Sorry.	negative
I kind of feel like this is a rip off!! I’ve been seeing bugs everywhere and I brought six of these things!!	negative
These were poorly threaded. I had them tight and while flying one popped off. Won't buy again	negative
Bought this for my son as a Christmas gift because he loves Sonic the Hat was super thin and so small it wouldn't fit my two year old let alone a 4 year old total rip-off!!	negative
Tastes like play- do flavored dish water	negative
These are not my idea of spa quality. The fabric is too thin to hold back hair as well as being cut too thin(slightly wider than a 2oz jar. They may be good for maybe kiddie pamper parties.. if that. The sewing is uneven.. just don’t do it	negative
Very comfortable!!! Soft leather, did not need to be broken in.	positive
Perfect for my Kirby vacuum and small apartment.	positive
The fingerprint scanner works perfectly OK on this screen protector.I am really satisfied with the result and I hope this lasts long.	positive
I bought these replacements for a pair of Marley earbuds. They worked great!	positive
This is a very affordable, yet quality red dot. If you are looking for a light weight rig and don’t want to take up a lot of real estate on your rail, then this is for you. Great for co witnessing with your open sights. I purchased the medium riser and it works perfect! For what I paid definitely impressed!	positive
Nice sturdy table. The walnut looks good, but not glossy as in the picture. It's a classic, but would be very boring without a nice centerpiece to make it stand out.	positive
Not a good choice for my Cockatoo. Not enough wood to be destroyed.	negative
Materials are cheaper than expected since they brag on how good they are. Size tolerances are all over so the screw caps all fit differently. Once you install the caps, your license plate is on permanently, caps cannot be removed without breaking the cover, bending the plate, etc.. Looks nice but quality and install leaves a lot to be desired.	negative
Sturdy and comfortable in the hand. Holds on to the blade well and is easily manipulated to create really sharp and hard beard lines. I also use it to keep my hard part updated.	positive
This was disappointing. It didnt stay attached ti the phone, it kept popping off, is not case friendly and I wouldn't recommend it.	negative
Im a 38 waist and the 47 was to small. Had to pull the belt to get it on. I could just see myself struggling with this in a public restroom and people looking at me weird	negative
Exactly what I wanted.	positive
Didnt fit the Amazon tablet fire 7. Buttons on the case are in the wrong location.	negative
Feel like am at a nice hotel!	positive
Too small for my D cup. The material is nice abs and soft. It is just too small for me. It showed too much of my midriff.	positive
"Very hard to use because it's too wide for your braces to really move around. Gonna use mine since I bought them and suffer the uncomfortableness. But won't purchase again. Great ""idea"" though."	negative
Great chargers for the money! Both are fast charging!	positive
I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a childhood like this. I love the PBS tv show but our the book is different and it follows Gerry more than the family. Some great laugh out loud parts and some sad parts, but all in all an enjoyable read.	positive
Poor quality, mine cracked at the bottom already. Smh, it’s made it the USA.	negative
I use this with the Logitech 430 and it works perfect. Works on my phone and my Xbox one. Cable matches the headset too. It's a great product I needed	positive
my son wanted one for fathers day and he used the tool and love it for cleaning the grill	positive
Bought these by mistake. My dogs don’t like them. Buy the soft chews instead.	negative
Great size, great quality, great price	positive
Do not waste your time or money!!! This was good enough to tickle my grass but if you want to trim or cut do not buy this! I was hesitant about this buy and so disappointed. In not just bashing im seriously trying to help people by warning of this product! Do not buy! I Would be been better off taking a pair of scissors to my lawn.	negative
This item is NOT authentic. Fake . Do not purchase.	negative
Buy this item if you want pillow with mold!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Smells horrible. Mold on pillow and zip broken!!!! I will not recommend!!!!	negative
Scam! The protection plan promises to be emailed. Was never sent. Amazon contacted them- still never received e-mail. Something very strange happened. I originally spent more $ on this item. When pulling up order to get refund - the listed price was lower.	negative
Very solid product I am very new to vinyl cutting and pretty much read reviews of different brand transfer vinyl , and this seemed the most promising. Boy were you guys not kidding. This is great stuff	positive
Have not used this because we cannot figure this out	negative
My wife loves this stuff. Personally, I think it smells as though Cheech and Chong just stopped by for a visit whenever she uses it.	positive
These plants are beautiful!! They come full of life and really well packaged ♡ definitely will order from them again.	positive
So upset was needed by Saturday and I still have not received it . Claims it was delivered at my address but I never got it so I now have to go out and buy another one .	negative
So darn adorable! Extremely comfy and warm. I usually wear an 8-8.5 and I ordered the 9-10 size. Fit perfectly! Just do yourself a favor and order these.	positive
I returned it. The pushes were too slim and the wire not strong enough to hold it between the platform and sleep number mattress.	negative
I did like it but the top broke	negative
The box was not delivered though Amazon tracking says it was. I seem to have no way to get a refund or communicate about this other than posting thos review.	negative
Very cute but the pics scratch off easily	positive
Reached out for resolution and still have not received missing dies.	negative
Watch works, but there is no way to turn of the analog minute hand adjustment. Consistently tells the wrong time in that aspect. Also very strange that the background light goes off every time you want to start or stop your timer. Not a bad watch for less than $15 but I wouldn't recommend it.	negative
just as described. good quality	positive
very hard to get a good print with this clay	negative
I loved bragging about the price of this veil! I bought this after seeing the price of veils at David bridal... Totally a great way to save money and still looked great.	positive
The rhinestone piece was already off when I received it in the mail. It can not handle the thicker, plastic frames. Made more for the real skinny metal frames.	negative
Sturdy material, super cute. Our daughter was thrilled with this bag!	positive
The cover fits my log splitter very well and stays put, even in heavy storms. However, after only 1-1/2 years, it developed a large split in the material. It wasn't damaged or stressed, it just split open. This tells me it's not high quality material. If you don't mind replacing it every one or two years, go for it.	negative
Very small print, but has everything!	positive
This book is great! The formulas are magnificent, bunches of delectable and tasty soups, stew and even breakfasts like oats, and pastries like cheesecake and chocolate cake! The creator is a specialist decent at cooking. This is a valuable cookbook on the topic of Cosori Pressure Cooker, which makes our cooking aptitude more brilliant! I exceedingly suggest this extraordinary book!	positive
Very cheap looking, not wide enough for Tahoe 2nd row. Attracts dirt	negative
Ewg verified! Kids like it	positive
Not soft. Don't put soft in the title if it's not soft. I have a picky dog.	negative
Great color just a little looser than the Garmin brand.	positive
I really do like these bags. Easy to use and clean. Great value for the money. And customer service is great too. Would buy again.	positive
I love the flame on this torch. But I’ve had a few of them and always have issues. I take really good care of my torches and I’ve had trigger issues and flame ignite issues with these torches. The one I just bought lasted 3 tender little uses before the trigger stopped clicking. So I gotta spark my own flame for it. I just wish they’d be more durable, because the flame is great.	negative
I really enjoyed the plot in this book. I wasn't sure what would happen but couldn't wait to going out. I think that Billy and Maxi were made for one another. I read it out of order and didn't feel like I was missing chunks. I'm now going to go back and read all the books.	positive
dressed up like mal for halloween all that stuff	positive
The three lens wipes that were supposed to be moist, were dry and completely useless.	negative
this is not a badminton net as advertised. It is a volleyball/badminton which is exactly what I didn't want.	negative
I have only had this watchband for a couple weeks. DOES NOT CLASP WELL. First noticed the issue when I was clapping my hands on my legs, and off came the watch. Today, walking down a hallway, watchband came unclasped again, $300 watch fell off, and broke. DO NOT BUY FOR ANY SPORTS WATCHES AS IT CANNOT EVEN HANDLE NORMAL WEAR.	negative
Very cute in the picture but meant for people with short torsos. It was definitely not cute on lol	negative
not much for your $$ mostly crushed chips	negative
They don’t stay on the face of the watch.	negative
First off - I like this product for what it does since I used it before & ordered more for my project. . However, the newly ordered product was not a full container. It was unopened but it was not full like the other container I previously purchased at the store. Can someone answer this ? Here is a photo of the product just opened from the amazon package.	negative
Smells terrible, I have not been able to use, it has been almost a month is on the patio..	negative
What more can I say. They are doing exactly what I wanted	positive
Slim and nice looking.	positive
This cartridge FITS but DOES NOT WORK ON OfficeJet 3830	negative
I ordered two of these and one of the packages was already opened and the bit was missing. The padded envelope was untampered and completely sealed. I also ordered a memory card which was included in the envelope. Anyway, I requested a replacement to be sent to me. I will update my rating when the new ones arrive in a few days.	negative
"Cute little fountain. My bird bath is entirely in the shade and it squirts up 8"". If you put it in your bird bath, it will empty it in 30 minutes. Great entertainment."	positive
Good story and action. Enjoyed it.	positive
We received a set of 3 owl necklaces and 3 bracelets instead of this set of rings. Husband opened it and daughter was playing with it before I came home. Hope the company will send me the correct product.	negative
8 modes and all they do is flash so much it can induce a seizure.	negative
Cute dress but very poorly made. The design at the bottom still had cut out pieces attached to it. The sleeve openings are also very small. Very thin and you can see through it.	negative
These screen protectors are so cheap and do not last very long at all! Not worth the money! I would have returned these but it wasn’t worth the time or the effort considering the quality.	negative
Poor quality. Solenoid doesn’t shut off CO2. Leaks badly! Do not buy!	negative
Costume fit except for mask eyes which were centered over the forehead instead of the eyes. You have to pull mask down to center them but the mask has a natural tendency to ride up somewhat and this requires more adjustment.	negative
This works but there an absolute lag. Not ideal.	negative
Returned it because it would not stay in my vent for the life of me. If I took a turn too fast my phone would could flying out!! Sent it back for a full refund without the box (didn’t know you could do that!)	negative
Runs small. Order a size or two up.	negative
Love this water it taste so good you will love it, now that I drink a lot of water I stopped having awful headaches I would get once a week	positive
Not the color advertised in the picture even the label is a different color.	negative
Looks good. Like its features. Only time (and travels) will tell if it's durable	positive
Not sure why the description says its glow in the dark. As far as I can see, it only glows under a black light. The color is really bright. It has the feel and consistency of medical tape. It's a sticky cloth feel.	positive
Lid was broke when receiving it..	negative
After I got my product, found out it has a three year warranty. This coverage starts after that expires. Will the product last that long?	negative
Works fine, but the mag connector feels flimsy and rattles	positive
Item was what I expected but after using 1/2 the hangers began finding broken ones. Disappointing.	negative
Had for less than a year and it literally fell apart. Do not recommend if you are looking for a long term knife.	negative
No benefit. Waste of money	negative
Great price and product quality and delivery	positive
Damaged my keyless entry and found this for less than $10! Changed my current damage keyless and was on my way!	positive
a little heavy but great quality!	positive
I love these chips. All the flavors are wonderful. They are much easier to eat than the regular pita chips. Not so hard on the teeth and very very tasty. I eat them every day.	positive
I got it less than a week ago and it already stopped working. Worked fine at first, used it maybe 5 times. Now I (a graduate student) am stranded without a computer charger.	negative
Water resistant my butt! I put my passport in it, and it molded. Also after a year, it became practically impossible to open. Do NOT buy this	negative
Loves these gloves! Super cozy and warm. Love that I can wear them and still use my phone. Will be purchasing more for family for Christmas!	positive
Flimsy, no middle click, and small and uncomfortable for large hands.	negative
I used to love the Bai Molokai coconut. Now it seems like every other bottle tastes off and I have to pour it down the drain. At first I thought it was my taste buds, but I always open another bottle and it tastes fine. I’m not sure if these can go bad, or if the formula changed or what. I do know that I don’t like being unpleasantly surprised and wasting money. I’ll have to go back to drinking spring water. 🙁	negative
Words cannot express the luxury of carrying around this bag for 2 days and making travel an adventure then an endeavor	positive
I miss Maisie Dobbs in between books so I like to savor the reading... I thoroughly enjoyed the secondary story in this one and did not guess the main mystery.	positive
If something could possibly be too small and too large then this is it	negative
The glass screen protector shattered with out the phone being dropped.	negative
Love this book. Pictures are vibrant and story is super fun to read BUT the book came a bit warped so it won’t close properly. It doesn’t affect the story so I kept it anyways.	positive
Not a good quality broken after week	negative
This is a book that I would call an “easy read”, but I would call it that with hesitation to not make it seem like it isn’t an amazing book. I loved being able to read about so many great Christian figures that literally changed the world with the Gospel! I would recommend this to all for sure.	positive
Sending it back because ours arrived with a defective valve -- you can hardly get any water thru the straw, just bubbles. Bought one for my older son a few months back and it is totally fine.	negative
Looks very cheap, and the light is not bright at all. Three days in the sun and the clear part of the light is already turning yellow ish. Save your money.	negative
I have never come across a cheaper cable then this. It would not release from the monitor as the release button was not working. CHEAP!!! MADE IN CHINA!!!! Disgusting. I would never ever buy from this company again. Had to throw the cable in the garbage and bought a great one at Best Buy.	negative
Good movie with great special effects, I have a 3D TV and definitely recommend this version for owners of similar TVs. As I recall, it won best picture at the Oscars.	positive
Actually i didnt want to put no star because i bought it less than one month	negative
This knife and tape never arrived although it said it was delivered to my secure mail box. When I sent the slip in for a refund I did not hear back from anyone. This is too much to pay for absolutely nothing. Don't buy from this vendor.	negative
I really liked the look of this clock, but right out of the box, one hand was bent. Annoying, but not too big a deal. My husband popped open the face of it and was able to straighten it out. Worked fine for a couple of weeks and now all of a sudden, it won't keep the right time. And it's not the battery. Something is off with the mechanics I guess. I don't know the deal but of course I'm past the return deadline now. For the price, I expected better.	negative
Bought for my wife who used it for 93 days, since it was past the return date couldn't get it returned. Wrote to BlueParrott and the refurb company (Solving Products, LLC) with no response would not buy product by BlueParrott or from Solving Products, LLC.	negative
I was hoping for some Behind the Scenes reruns or something like that but it just had all the urban programing instead.	negative
These trays are really nice! The cube size is smaller than some but I am using them as extra to have on hand so no big deal on the size. The cubes are easy to remove from the trays and I like the lid - nice added feature.	positive
I just got permanent retainers on upper and lower teeth. Bought Super Floss and found the plastic threader is so flimsy and bends, I can’t get it through the teeth. I tried the floss on teeth without the retainers and it shreds leaving fibers stuck in the teeth, cuts into my fingers and between some teeth won’t even slide down. Want a refund!	negative
I'm disappointed that the box was crushed and looked like it had been that way for a long time, as this was meant to be a gift. It still looked okay, and all the products were fine, so I'm overall happy with my purchase. The test sizes look big enough to try multiple times, while the balm and tins all look normal-sized to what you'd find in the grocery line. Good value, cute gift, bad packaging.	positive
I purchased the “rose gold” case and it’s really not even like the picture shown 😒	negative
Honestly, I forgot that I even ordered them. I haven't used them yet.	positive
I brought this for my mans and he loves it....... it's also smaller than I thought but a great gift for all	positive
The lights looked great, while they lasted. They quit working after 1st night.	negative
These were nice for a few days and then 3/4 fell off my car.	negative
The paint is horrible. I have used better paint in a third graders art class. It dried quickly no doubt but left a powdery residue that came off like sugar on a white powdered donut. Never again Krylon.	negative
Didn't even last a few weeks before breaking. Terrible. Do not buy.	negative
Wrong shade was sent - I am rating this badly because you have sent me the wrong shade. I ordered Light and you have sent me Fair. It’s a pink/white shade so I can’t even make use of it and have given it to a friend. Now I am without foundation to wear for work until I place another order and wait for it to arrive.	negative
My last phone last em 4 years without a scratch, so I am very good at taking care of my stuff. This Cover plastic material will brake between the firsts weeks. It comes without screen protector so if it fells your phone will brake.	negative
It’s good it fits all my welding school equipment but it’s only good for short people. People at my school have the same tool box	positive
Quick and easy, but wished I had pictures of people of color of a couple of them	positive
I ordered this through prime and it took over a week to get here. I bought something else in the mean time and then found out this is non-returnable.	negative
I've had the product for 1.5 months and it just stopped working. I do not move it and leave it plugged in...and nothing has happened to it. All of a sudden it is skipping tracks and it sounds like it's playing every other word of the music in slo-mo. Really disappointing as I had such high hopes for this to be a good long-term item that I could use to play my mantras.	negative
I was told this 4-year extended warranty started AFTER manufactures warranty- it's for THREE YEARS, NOT 4	negative
The inside of the box was rusted in two locations.	negative
These make decent Surface Pen replacements. They aren't as heavy duty as the original surface pens, but they do the job.	positive
Item arrived damanged and oozing purple shampoo everywhere. Huge mess....	negative
I didn't expect much for this price, so I was not disappointed. I was hoping there was some shading in the dots but I added that myself with a black Sharpie. They are good for my purposes.	positive
Item is very cute. My daughter wanted this for her future son even though it wasn’t organic which is what she’s trying to use. she thought it was super cute it but it had a not natural order to it. we didn’t even wash it to see if the odor washed out. since the baby will be in his bassinet most of the first part of life we don’t want him breathing in anything with a toxic odor.	negative
Cute, my only complaint is that is isn’t as bright as I’d thought, the material reminds me of a tint. I still like the overall design a lot and would recommend.	positive
The mouse had a great feel but the setup process is awful and the G buttons never worked out of the gate.	negative
I didn't get what I order the picture show me a camera that was mote control on a drone what they sent me was a still camera go camera	negative
Idk why but I must fit right in between a 2x & a 3x bc I've purchased both & a 2x is too small & a 3x is huge. Very sad.	negative
Doesn't work on pull tab cans from Costco. But it works in your standard tuna can.	positive
If I only bought one of the Whistle Stop Products this is the one I would buy and use it for everything	positive
I love this Saucony shoe - very comfortable G	positive
Upset with this...I ordered citrus cooler because I cant find a store that sells it. They send me ORANGE....which you can get everywhere....ugh	negative
A distinguish gentleman's hat. Fits true to size. you'll love this look and get many compliments!!!	positive
Great item just really small bottle	positive
I need more magnification. It is my fault for not understanding how much magnification I would get according to the specs. For me, there was little change. This also feels a bit flimsy.	negative
Powered up and used these for about 3 hours the day I received them. Seemed good, phone use, sound quality, earbuds a little big even after swapping the rubber piece to the smallest but I prepared for that. My ear canals are smaller than average. The next day, the headset wouldn’t power on. I tried charging them but the blue light remained on while doing so. Blue light indicates fully charged. Not sure what happened here. Wasted money.	negative
I purchased this for my grandson. I was surprised at how small they are. These will be good for snacks .	positive
Do not buy. Battery worked great the first 2 weeks. Now it goes from 100% to 30% in 45 minutes of use, dies shortly there after. It's a complete waste. I wish I could return and get my money back.	negative
Excellent product, it is really great for the price, I like it very much	positive
work good however do not last as long as the lexmark branded cartridges	positive
Package arrived completely torn apart as pictured. Would definitely not recommend nor would I buy again from this seller.	negative
My cleaner shrimp was sucked into the fans. Needs a filter or something to prevent this.	negative
Very lightweight, and shuts off instantly if it senses movement (picking up or knocked over) but it will occasionally shut off for no reason except that it over heats. Perfect size for a small office	positive
No practical for me. Went to trash can very quickly.	negative
I love these and can't wait to wear them on our excursion for our cruise. They are so comfortable! I have worn them outside on the rocks and I didn't feel a thing. I would say that these are true to size.	positive
This is a very well designed product. The frame is very sturdy and the wheels attaching seconds. The grocery bag is an attractive color and pattern. I have received complements on the street about it the bag is spacious and has 4 outside pockets and even the closing flap has storage room. Whoever designed this product really took into consideration the needs of people who obviously rely on public transportation and walking to their destinations.	positive
Surprised at how small this bottle was. Also left our hair greasy feeling. Threw it out.	negative
I literally could not put this down, I read it straight through. It kept me wanting more. I felt like I was there watching the story unfold.	positive
Works great so far. Doesn't seem to move as much air as my last 12k BTU one did but it is a lot quieter too. If you use the constant drain method during cooling, be prepared to empty the bucket a lot! We have more than half filled a 5 gallon bucket in less than 10 hours!	positive
Lovely rug for the price!	positive
Used one time and the puff fell apart.	negative
Bought May 2018, left me stranded September 2019. A standard battery at half this price would have lasted much longer. Trash.	negative
Looks good. The legs are sturdy but the tops of the table and benches are not. Some of the corners have dings from shipping. If I can get a partial refund I will replace the tops with real wood otherwise I need to find a way to return it.	negative
Installed fine but went in the shower with it and the water got up under it terrible waste of money	negative
It did work somewhat but it's not a great muscle rub	negative
One fell on the floor, dog rejected. That's how bad it is	negative
I was always losing my glasses in the house. This is a cute and funny way to always know where my glasses are.	positive
I bought 6 of these power banks in various colors. One was supposed to be gold. The box said gold. I ordered gold for a specific reason. When I opened the box, it was silver. I already had purchased a silver power bank. Not happy at all!	negative
Absolutely horrible. Fingerprints, face prints, smudgy and impossible to use in sunlight! Literally cannot see screen. Want my money back, and going to go find the one i used before!	negative
Fast shipping and excellent product.	positive
Nicely made. Fits Great	positive
Poorly written, typographical errors were abundant, it seemed to be written by a juvenile.	negative
Its okay. Not the greatest in my opinion	negative
Nice for my suits and have a gripping texture to keep pants from sliding off. A bargain	positive
This filter does not fit ALL Keurig 2.0 and is not eligible for return.	negative
I never received my item.	negative
The quality is low. It falls down easily and there's no way to fix the issue. Assembling and dissembling is all hassle. First time I used the bulb base stuck and the bulb itself came out. So I have to find a new bulb and the ceramic base itself is also broken. Overall it's full of hassle and I would not recommend anyone to by this product. Worse part is I didn't use it in the first month and the return window is closed. So it's gonna end up in garbage can.	negative
Last membrane like this one lasted only 2 months. Clogs in no time. Will not purchase this one again. Poor quality.	negative
Not durable at all. Ripped at the crotch on day 1.	negative
I needed red take to label my baby's baby bottles for day care. It's nice to be able to find red tape but it's not as sticky when used over the cold bottles.	positive
Do not buy anything from this site then thieves your stuff does not come And then they don’t reply when you ask	negative
I've been looking for a product that would give my hair body and this is it! At 55, I started noticing my hair thinning. I know it is age and hormones, but this shampoo has really helped with the hair loss. I'm wondering if part of the hair loss was the shampoo chemicals I was using before. Whatever the reason this works, I don't know, but it does! And the body it gives my hair is incredible. I love it!	positive
It is very light in weight so easy to carry in almost all bags ..	positive
This product is to small for a men's XL. The top needs to be longer and the bottoms have no pee hole which all men's long johns should have. Is it possible that a women's XL was wrongly packaged as men's?	negative
This was the worst movie in the Thor series I’ve ever seen. Lousy plot like the writer was tripping on drugs. Thor refers to himself as a god. Blasphemy. I threw it in the trash.	negative
Good for the price what we end up paying . Happy with the purchase	positive
It's a very pretty sweater is just was a little bit larger than I expected	negative
One of the batteries didn’t work, it just spun in the receiver and wouldn’t make contact. The other battery did work.	negative
The corners of this case began flaking, cracking and chipping off within a few weeks of normal use. The cover wasn't dropped or manhandled at all. The corners are now basically gone and jagged edges of plastic are there. I'm concerned the kindle will no longer be secure, and it is uncomfortable to hold due to the sharp plastic bits.	negative
These pillow cases are 1. Extremely shiny - the photos don’t do them justice, think Prince’s bedroom, a 90’s porno, maybe even both at the same time 2. Not great if you are hot at all they become sticky and generally feel gross 3. If you are I deed hot, put on lotion, or look at them the wrong way they stain and will need to be washed	negative
Cant figure it out,and again USB port was not with it and it didnt say that just another thing you have to bye and it doesnt work yet	negative
very informative perfect for needs of knowledge	positive
These are okay. Didn’t have many white ones or dark.	positive
My family of four went camping & this tent was perfect! It was ample room for a queen bed and a full bed and all of stuff including two box fans a small table and lamp. Very easy and quick to assemble & take down.	positive
Poorly made. The prongs are uneven and difficult to spread or close a strong snap ring. These tools are useless to an automotive mechanic.	negative
Their a little heavy but good quality leather. Will buy again.	positive
I have Neuropathy and need something on my feet most of the time. These fit a little tight and almost feel like a compression sock, they make my feet feel better.	positive
As expected. Great quality.	positive
Very high quality hose	positive
I don't get why every review site rates this as the best wireless headset you can buy. The microphone quality is mediocre, but the sound is even worse. It's not that it sounds bad, but it's so quiet. You really can't turn it up enough to clearly hear footsteps, especially from far away. The max volume is very low. It's strange. It's also not very comfortable for me.	negative
Popped during first use!	negative
The product was exactly as described. It was sent promptly.	positive
I mix this stuff into the more brightly colored options offered by the same company. Haven't noticed any problems and my conure seems to enjoy it.	positive
Returned. The Mac didn't even recognize it.	negative
This is only 18” long. MUCH shorter than shown in the picture. Not long enough to reach any dashboard. Big disappointment and a cruel bait and switch.	negative
They claim that this was fit my Toyota Camry and they're really too small	negative
Not super high quality. Good for China-made on a budget. But it is lightweight, easy to install, nice flat, stable seat. Not worth $100 imo but it does the job.	positive
I loved the packaging! Arrived within 2 days and it was exactly what I wanted & expected!	positive
Works as expected, but breaks easily. I had to replace mine because I only drop it once and stop working	positive
Pillow Cover slick and not a typical pillow material. Would NOT recommend. The REAL Better Homes and Garden pillow from Walmart that has insert included and not just a cover has a cost of $2.00 more and is worth the money, NOT this pillow COVER. DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller's pillow cover at all.	negative
Works great for 2 months , after that disintegrated.	negative
It rained on my bike ride and now only the light works. No radio no bluetooth. 20 days old.	negative
Wonderful handmade beer mug! I bought it as a gift and it totally worth it. Made to last, looks great, solid and quite large. Got that authentic feeling to it. 5 stars	positive
Like the last two, it failed after 2nd or 3rd use! These little things just can't handle retracting all that cord. Just to weak!	negative
This is cheap and so not worth the money. The video isn't great either. And I'm pretty sure I was sent a used item.	negative
Works exactly as intended.	positive
If your the outdoors camper person this is ideal. Small and compact in its own carry case, so nothing gets dirty after using it. You do have to buy the gas separate from this	positive
Very cute. Great wedding gift. Doesn't look cheap or flimsy.	positive
This was really nice for the price. I am hoping when it was it that it holds up	positive
Have to get used to it at first but once you do it works great. No issues with the product and I haven’t heard my partner complain... Yet!!	positive
Loves how beautifully it was made. The pendant itself is a bit small but it works just fine with my Moana cosplay.	positive
Flip flops are light and comfortable. The size is a bit small.	positive
It works well as a memory device of where I went and where I still need to go.	positive
My fingers typically get cold so I was hoping these would do the trick. After a 20 walk in 20 degree weather (dry and sunny) my fingers were getting cold.	negative
Great price on pasta! 8 boxes for less than 10.	positive
Bought for my husband-he loves them	positive
The only reason this review is receiving 2 stars is because the bottom shelf arrived sign hair in it. Totally unsanitary and illustrative of a lack of quality control where cleanliness.	negative
This is a good quality product uses primary for graphics and design; it has a good price and good quality, I will recommend this product for anyone will like to have a product that last for long time. thank you	positive
Great brush pens, but hard to move the color around... so for that alone these get 2 stars.	negative
I wouldn't recommend it, bad quality.	negative
I have no garage to keep my weights covered. During the summer the shade is adequate to keep the sun out of my eyes and a nice cool breeze blowing through my workout area. I have placed anchors in the ground and attached the legs with hose clamps. The joints have been screwed together using self tapping screws. The cover lasts about 3 yrs before replacing the cover only. The frame has a very good powder coating that lasts a long time depending on environment.	positive
I never received the product yet it's been a very long time	negative
All our kids love this toy! Even though it’s geared for girls in its colors our boys love it as much as our daughter. They love all the things it does and they all enjoy it.	positive
Nice quality, minimalist earrings.	positive
the style is good, but the fabric is really not like i expected, it is more like nylon feeling. We had to throw this away unfortunately.	negative
Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.	positive
I thought this was going to be an upgrade over my previous trimmer, but I was wrong. The trimmer length kept shifting during my trim. I usually had to do it three or four times to fix spots that initially got missed. Waste of money.	negative
I have not used it yet due to lack of snow. but so far I likes the size and the easy electric start.	positive
Have to pay shipping to return to China! Not worth ordering from them! Still haven't received refund!	negative
IT seemed to be working great and a day of the 30 days it cracked. I wasn't wrestling or treating it bad it just got cause somehow and just cracked. Very dissapointing. everything else worked great!	negative
I would give it 0 stars if I could. The box was disheveled and the label was half off. There was no seal on the box nor was the tube sealed in any way. The product looked used. I contacted the seller and was asked if I wanted a replacement or a refund. I responded that if a factory sealed product was the replacement, I would be happy with that. I have yet to hear back. I believe I have wasted my money. In this instance, Amazon’s lower price option was the WRONG option.	negative
These sheets are comfortable and seem pretty heavy duty.	positive
the design is very nice, it has a great feeling on the hands, design wise for gamers is top notch, Great controller for a great price, no lags and responsive overall very impressive switch controller	positive
Concerned about the recently exposed danger of excess ozone.....	negative
Our grandson age 3 wears them daily around the house. That’s how comfortable they are. Recommended	positive
I like that it doesn't scratch and that it can be washed.	positive
I am annoyed with the price fluctuations on this product, sometimes it is extremely reasonable and other times it costs more than getting a whole new filtration system. I have researched alternative filters in great depth and I have not found any other ones that are compatible with this system. I did not replace it yet because I it is really great for my cats' preferences and I hate to waste plastic for no reason, but I will avoid the brand next time.	negative
Great for my daughters hair, doesn't build up or cause hardness. Not greasy, ,simply a nice styling product.	positive
I didn't realize that I have to continually recharge the headphone battery. Why doesn't it recharge as it's being used?	negative
This feeder didn't work at all. Birds came, the camera was fully charged and on, no pictures were taken. Very disappointed, and should have read the other reviews first. Returning this item.	negative
I've actually already purchased a calendar from this company for my desk because I like the style and that they aren't that expensive. Is it the most highest quality paper ever? No. Does it come with fun bonus stickers? Yes. Honestly, its decent for office use. I've found that buying calendars at a store are way more expensive and not as cute. I like that this has a little checklist area on the right side too so that you can plan stuff out.	positive
I enjoyed the movie. My favorite part was the 2 cops that appeared on screen. The cop that was the driver was the funniest from the movie, but overall enjoyable.	positive
For the price I guess that's what you get, but mine stopped holding any charge after about a month and a half. Worked fine otherwise and worked well at first, but quickly deteriorated.	negative
Two of the heads came apart taking them out of the package.	negative
Great product. Solid construction and hangs up easily with great directions and screws included. Looks good too. And very reasonable price. Would order again	positive
Im looking for the old cotton spandex that are a little thick and these are not them. They are completely see thru everywhere, front and back. I plan on using them for softball since I wear sliders underneath. You can't just wear them out or to the gym. Everyone will see your goodies. Super thin!	negative
There is obviously no flavor in these noodles (which you'd expect for zero calories). Works best when you can take the time to allow whatever sauce you're using to soak in some flavor. Not a huge fan of the rice but the angel hair and fettuccine have been a big plus. Even my wife (who isn't on keto) enjoys it as a replacement for spaghetti or stir fry.	positive
works well - got cold fast and maintains temperature	positive
Love this product helps my IBS and reduces bloating and gas	positive
I used these to hang a strand of Christmas lights but they kept falling off the wall. I tried a 2nd time with new adhesive strips and hooks and same result. Might have been too much weight but....they’re lights. Not that heavy.	negative
1st watch the hands fell off within a month or 2, so I bought another and when it showed up the clasp was loose and kept falling off. Was great while it lasted, I returned the 2nd one and decided to not buy another one after disposing of the 1st.	negative
Great not to comfy alright can fit adjust to any size	positive
I ordered a 4 pack = 320 wipes. I received 1 pack of 80 wipes. There is no way for me to contact amazon to ask them to send the other 3 packs, so I paid $14.99 for 1 pack.	negative
its what I ordered lawnmower	positive
Does what it should, great price. Used it for many hours already.	positive
Fast charges devices magnet is strong and it fits nicely on your key ring.	positive
Loved this set w a couple of exceptions. The “Oh Baby” foil balloons were cute but 2 letters came w holes in the balloons. We put them up anyway BC we’re relaxed but you might not be. The delicate tissue Pom-poms were adorable but not as easy to form as they make them out to be. It turned out fine and my daughter just enjoyed attempting these things together. The paper lanterns were a BIG hit as were the banners w burlap “Welcome Baby.” For the price it was a huge success.	positive
Bought as a gift for my daughter. She was very pleased with it look of it.	positive
Pretty good! Average nose rings. 6mm was a little small for me but I should have known better. Would be cuter in someone with a smaller nose. Good mixed variety of colors	positive
Burns out quite quickly unlike most LED lifts that should last for years	negative
This is just my personal opinion. I thought the pillow was too soft. I want to use it for traveling and it would probably be OK just to use on the plane or in the car for short stints but I travel overseas for months at a time and wanted to be able to use it as a bed pillow too. Just not to my liking.	negative
Great quality, great price. Larger than i expected. I can fit my bar pad in it which is awesome! And its super cute and feminine! I love the bag!	positive
Does a good job of grabbing very hot and short handles on a cast iron or cast aluminum pan/skillet without getting burned.	positive
We rec'd the table with a crack, contacted the seller, and a new one was sent out immediately. They were great!!	positive
Never received the item	negative
By far THE WORST and warmest comforter EVER!	negative
I never got my product.	negative
This case has provided exactly what I was looking for...A case that looked sleek and slim but provided the necessary protection for my iPad. I am very pleased with this product, and the price was great, too.	positive
I bought this solar lights for the convenience and price. There are perfect for what I need them for. The motion sensor was awesome. There were easy to install. The brightest was perfect for the space where I put them. I just want to say that I recommend this product without hesitation.	positive
Good if you want a dumbell, but that’s about it! 1. Unacceptably Heavy as a ROCK 2. Unlike description, incompatible with iPhone jack for listening while charging 3. Spontaneously stops charging! 4. Feels cheap 5. Poorly written instructions. Seriously people, you have the Amazon platform to sell your product on! Can you seriously not afford a proper translator? So dissapointed, returning!	negative
The product works as described	positive
Batteries came as indivual sleeves and not boxed. Just a mess and took from Nov 13th until Dec 11th to get them.	negative
excellent, charges quick, seems to work great	positive
Bought this as a gift and my husband loves it!! Very cute and affordable	positive
I like the look and color.There is often food residue in the teeth.I used this.It's very clean.Brush your teeth after each use and feel very comfortable.Very clean.It's also quieter.Lightweight.Feel comfortable.Logistics is fast.Customer service is good.The service attitude is also very good.A reliable product.	positive
I wish the smoke color were a little more transparent, but protects the phone well.	positive
This shelf just puts my computer on, I think it is a good fit.	positive
This helmet is terrible! I got it for my husband. It was uncomfortable, bulky, and got scratched almost immediately. I will say it was warm, but it made him look like an idiot. His head is big, and this made it look even bigger. He looked like Charlie brown skiing down the mountain. Wa-waa...	negative
They are bigger than expected but the wife is happy.	positive
I love this used the day after I got it with my daughter for a little pampering we enjoyed it used it on my feet and hands made them both so soft it even came with gloves and some plastic to keep it in	positive
I bought a bunch of these for my staff as a gift for all of us to work together as a team and everyone's neck turn green oops!	negative
Works well and is exactly as described. Easy to use, difficult to clean. Arrived on time and without incident.	positive
Slipped off of heel, would have rubbed a blister, returning.	positive
Smaller then I expected! Quality is ok but not great! Won’t order again!	negative
A good set of knock off iPhone ear buds, however everything about this ad is designed to deceive the buyer into thinking that they are wireless/Bluetooth. THEY ARE NOT.	negative
Nice to cut down on plastic. It’s easy to fill the bottle I already have.	positive
Awesome product for the money	positive
Amazing ! Doesn’t feel like too much pressure. Just the right amount .	positive
my other one konked out after a few months, this one is so far so good, seems like a better design with the batteries on the back instead of the bottom,	positive
I love James Thomas and the entire cast of characters! This story picked right on up from the last book, providing closure to several side plots, and laying ground for future story lines. One thing that was extremely irritating was the lack of review and grammar corrections needed. Very disappointed since having to mentally correct and edit sentences, words, and grammar tends to detract from the story. I hope the editor does a better job next time.	positive
Arrived when scheduled and as described. So far it fits and works well. Only complaint is I ordered them in black and got bright blue. Not a huge deal, I just prefer cords to blend and not stand out so much if I have the choice.	positive
Too small for my face	negative
I buy this product a lot and have never had a problem with it but this most recent shipment is hardly a gel..... it's more like a liquid. Did they water it down?	negative
I like these! Comfortable without being too large around the ear. Having a little challenge finding the right sized bud, however these are the best ones I've found so far!	positive
Product was suppose to be a 2 volume set paid $120 and only received one volume, never received the 2nd volume. NEVER BUY FROM THIS AGAIN!	negative
The flavor is good. The batter is very thick. I had to add additional liquid to thin it out to my taste. Would buy this product again.	positive
I like that they fit perfectly	positive
Absolutely terrible, no pigmentation, tons of fallout!	negative
Had to press very hard to get touch to work. Wouldn't stay on phones	negative
Has a creamier taste but not feel. Its ok	positive
Probably will not order online again. The boxs came opened.	negative
Fell apart after about a month, the soft silicone later rubs off and out doesn’t protect the screen at all.	negative
I have really tried to like this cookbook. I've used it consistently for about a month and the majority of the recipes are not very flavorful. My children hate the dinners. Will be looking elsewhere.	negative
dog gone good by golly very fine story hope your paper comes out Cheerio and the girls are spending Friday in the mornings	positive
Loved these! But after about 3 weeks of wearing it, it broke	positive
The quality of these is so poor worse than a dollar store find.	negative
Gave 2 of these as great gifts !!	positive
They are nice and bright daylight color but flicker on the low setting on my Samsung microwave oven range hood. Not a big deal since we only use it in high but loose 1 star for that.	positive
Great taste, convenient size; but this is the second carton I've received that the use by date was two weeks from date of purchase.	negative
Product is ok. The item came in with broken plastic eye dropper. I did replace with glass droppers	positive
I truly appreciate your gift of writing. I felt like Kayla was a part of my family as seeing how I watched her grow through out your stories. Man oh man, Parker just about broke my heart at his life story. Another emotionally beautiful love story.	positive
I so wanted to love this gate be ause of its tall height but the arm is leaking fluid. We have had this installed less than 2 months. I am not sure if the leak is going to reach my carpet. Is this a flaw? Does anyone else see leakage at the arm?	negative
Does not get progressively harder. Is quite easy may be better for ESL and grade school. If you play a lot of word games, this will bore you quickly. Ads occur after each screen played. Each screen takes about 10 seconds to complete. I played off and on for two days, hoping it would get better. It didnt.	negative
Kinda cheap feeling, but they work fine for what I need. The child protective covers are hard to open.	positive
These did not stay stuck to the wheel. Came off within days	negative
These worked great for me as a bridesmaid in a wedding. Washed at end of night and they are sticky again for easy reuse.	positive
This is a good sized screen but is not lined in the back however this dosent appear to be an issue if theres no light coming from behind the screen. My kids hook the xbox up to it and play video games on it and we had outdoor movie night and it worked great! It is a light frame and will need to be weighed down a little if its breezy outside. I am very happy with this purchase!	positive
"This CD won't play on a Windows PC - it's like the CD is blank (other Rhino CDs play just fine). Told the supplier to send a refund instead of wasting another two months trying to get a ""good"" one. Beware!"	negative
Received axle puller all broken and used... ok so i did ship it back for replacement ok... second time it came in ok condition, but with missing parts... terrible service AMAZON doing crappy job!!!	negative
Can’t really taste the flavor over the heat but it is def hot!!	positive
These are very small wooden pegs. Check the details for exact size. Because they are so small they are quite fiddly and do fall apart if you are not careful, however I'm sure it would be impossible to make sturdier pegs this size. Would recommend. Perfect for holding Polaroids on a string or for card making!	positive
There were no instructions for using the extra pieces - brackets and bars. However, I just laid it on top of my glass covering my aquarium, and it illuminates my tank wonderfully. My old florescent light was no longer working properly, and I'd never seen anything like these LED lights before. Its compact size is great!	positive
We haven't used this yet but it appears to be well designed, with a hook and a zippered compartment; and an extra bonus - some small bottles to hold liquids.	positive
Good. Tight. Works well.	positive
My magnet won’t stay on to the iPad I’ve gone through both of the disk that they give you it won’t stays on.	negative
Love this Clinique duo all about eyes travel pack, easy to use and small enough to put in a purse. Great product	positive
I wrote a review, but it got lost somehow. Basically the blades scratched up.	negative
I’m disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.	negative
I have a laptop that doesn't have Bluetooth built in and the wifi started cutting out, so I got this. It's neen working fine thus far.	positive
Great socks, but they are too tight for my husband! The information said fits most people. My husband wears a 91/2 shoe and he is a small man. I got the socks on, but it was difficult and they were leaving an indentation on his ankle. They are very nicely made socks and what I wanted, but not large enough.	negative
Thought it was bigger	negative
Exactly what I was looking for. Am using it indoors while working with my laptop on the couch.	positive
I love this game it's so fun and there is so much to do in the game	positive
Poor quality control. Major flaw on surface area. Sent it back.	negative
not as good as year old samsung	negative
Nice feeling, a bit long, Great support and hiding power. Great for the active man who doesn’t want rash and rubbing issues	positive
Good heat reflection. Decent length, but a little narrow in the width...but I knew this before buying. The downside and the reason for 2 stars instead of 5 is it deflates during the night enough that my body touches the ground by morning when laying on my side. Did this first and every use.	negative
I definitely recommend this book & the others.	positive
Plastic on the blending arm cracked open after less than 2 years of rare use... replacement part is $29.99 plus shipping and tax. KitchenAid offers no warranty when you purchased something more than one year ago. So might as well buy a new one even though the motor is still working fine. Overall very disappointed, I really liked this blender.	negative
Laptop was a birthday gift. The birthday girl was so happy. So far, so good. I have to say, I ordered the laptop at about 12 noon on a Sunday, and by 6 Sunday night it was at my door! What awesome service! One thing about the laptop is that it gets hot quickly, so not sure what that may lead to, but I bought a 2 year warranty. Hopefully, there will be no issues and the birthday girl will continue to be happy, happy!	positive
I love this hoodie except for one thing - you can probably wear football shoulder pads under it. =S Soft, warm, silk-like fabric sleeve lining and the body & hood are sherpa-lined.	positive
Haven't used all of them but so far all OK!!	positive
Great product! Great experience!	positive
Garbage. Have bought twice to try and use and failed both times and can’t get in contact with seller. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY	negative
I read a lot and I didn't think the book was well put together..the thoughts were a little choppy for me so it didn't keep me engaged, therefore, I stopped reading.	negative
Horrible! Touch screen doesn't work with it. Has to press very hard	negative
This trap never killed anything. The light would go on at times but never anything inside and often the bait was gone. I changed batteries twice to see if that was the problem. Nothing worked. I have tried several of these electronic rat traps over the years. Many years ago the old rat zapper worked really well. I have not found anything that works since then..including the new rat zappers. Not sure what the problem is????	negative
Soft, came on time, nice packaging, love it.	positive
Moves extremely slow even with new batteries. My cats love typical laser lights bur were not impressed at all with this waste of money.	negative
I rated a 4 because of the detail in the mold it was what I was looking forward to having, but alas the size was not favorable for what I needed it for. It’s best for maybe candy molds but not a cake like I had intended.	positive
This did kill a mouse first time out, but no lights working so how is one supposed to know if in fact it is working? --- Update----- The seller responded very quickly to this problem and is sending out a new one......	negative
I always get compliments when I'm wearing this. It smells great and lasts most of the day.	positive
I returned this product and I never received my refund	negative
Every year we buy these lanterns to celebrate my father-in-law who passed away. I have bought various lanterns, but these kept ripping and one caught fire even though we correctly installed the fuel pad and made sure that sides were at a distance while it inflated.	negative
Bad. Just bad. The fabric is scratchy and the seams are uncomfortable. And, the inner ball was the incorrect size. A waste of time! Sent it back the same day I received. It's too bad because it's a great idea, just a poor design and poor quality control.	negative
This was an excellent gift for my son's birthday!	positive
VERY SMALL PINCHED HEAD AND STREAKS IN LENS	negative
Really loved these- easy to use with one hand- essential when wrangling multiple children.... but they broke after just a week of use.	negative
I used this to repair some stones on our walk and it worked. This adhesive is no joke. It is extremely strong and dries very fast. It’s been several months after using and it’s still holding. Very good product.	positive
The quality is perfect. Very elegant too!	positive
Great bag, very colorful. 4 stars because the hanging hoop came apart pretty quick.	positive
This was a joke! This is definitely a cheaply made alcohol detector. It came with no directions, as well. Just in a plain white box in a plastic bag. Really? If you purchased one, get your money back. If you haven't, steer clear!! Since I don't drink, it's going back.	negative
Great product and quick shipper	positive
I recently bought two, but only one worked!!! 🙁 No way to contact seller	negative
Colors are pretty but it is way smaller than I expected	negative
The photo shows two bottles and I only received one.. very disappointing ;( the low rating is due to deceptive advertising	negative
This was the 5th Yi camera I bought. The first 4 worked well. This cams picture is absolutely horrible and has been getting worse quickly over time. This will be the last came I buy from Yi.	negative
Ordered the 2 batteries but only one battery in box.	negative
Absolutely gorgeous sunglasses. Well made, polarized and very expensive looking. Get TONS of compliments. Will be ordering other colors.	positive
I didn't like the way it works, feels just stiff, not technologically thought through.	negative
It just wasn't worth it. Disappointed in Logitech. Amazon should refund to me.	negative
This is a great practice ballroom shoe for the money! It fit perfectly and I didn’t have to add any holes on the strap either! I will buy again if they have my size! I typically wear a street size 7.5 and a ballroom dance shoes size 7. I like them to fit snug but comfortable. These work best for medium width feet with a square toe box. Don’t expect these to last if you wear them outside, they are not meant for that.	positive
Though I like the watch - it’s notification capabilities are not working in their entirety. Just sms. And not email or Instagram alerts which are on their app, but don’t work. The app says twitter, Facebook and other Chinese social media notifications but I don’t need all that. Tried emailing support but no response. Website is in Chinese. There is no phone number either. If they fix this I will happily edit my ratings but if not, this will be returned. Hope they read these reviews although that might be wishful thinking.	negative
This computer is great! This was my first time purchasing a refurbished product. I admit I was quite reluctant, but decided I wouldn't know if I didn't try. I was NOT disappointed.. Looks and runs like a new unit.	positive
Took 3 weeks longer than what it said to deliver. I was already back from my trip.	negative
Broke in 3 weeks, damaged my bed frame wood, hard to maneuver into place.	negative
"Ordered this book as a gift NEW. The book came a bit beat up especially on the corner, with a sticker on the back that says, ""Used Very Good."" and it has clear tape on the corner. Hard to use as a gift"	negative
Band seems strong. Safe for surfing & water sports however the black color on the metal parts began chipping off after just a few weeks of wear and it now looks pretty cheap.	negative
If you are ok with a tube, this is a fine purchase, if you are buying it to ease pressure on you hips, i.e. sleep with it between your knees, this is not the pillow for you.	negative
Awesome cast, story line,plot and twist. Poetic	positive
This was everything I didn't even know I wanted!!! Love and fabulous Ness. I am definitely buying the whole series now!	positive
Give you 4 ports for charging (two ports on extension). Long enough cord to run extension to the back seat. Available accessories include clip to hang it and mount for headrest. I still need to test to charge all 4 devices at once.	positive
Love the shape and for anyone who purchases these, they are tips not full cover nails.	positive
Screen seems nice but out of the two one came cracked hope the read this and send a non cracked screen	negative
My pit loves it but he don't have food allergies he has flea allergies. No need to buy expensive food my dog loves this mixed with Rachael Ray peak or the just 6.	positive
Fantastic travel adapter! Bringing this to my international travels and love the compact size and different usb ports. The USB C port is a much needed upgrade! It can charge all my devices and is very versatile. Will always bring for my travels!	positive
These crack very easily. You will blow through the first one and put on the second one before you know it. Not sure quality is there	negative
The first thing I noticed about this toothbrush holder is how well it’s made. The materials used and the welding makes this toothbrush holder far superior than others I’ve held before. The stainless still goes well with all theme you may have in your restroom. Highly recommend it!	positive
All I'm disappointed about is the poor quality than what I thought it was. Very flimsy metal.	negative
The book is well written and interesting. I'm enjoying it very much.	positive
Heat from body and sweat makes these into firm bandages - they congeal into lumps that can't be unwound and must be either cut off or pulled down from my knee down to and over my foot.	negative
I absolutely love these gloves I purchased two pairs, one for myself and one for my friend, for our snowboarding trip and they were perfect for texting on the lift! We used them as liners under our heavy gloves and they were great!	positive
Helped my husband knee, but material does not hold up very well.	negative
The key broke when under load. It would be great if they could reset the key because other than that it is a good product	negative
COTTON WITH NOT MUCH GIVE SO ORDER LARGER IF A QUESTION ON SIZE	positive
Although order and payment were very organized with this purchase, the product didn't perform well. I gave it an earnest 30 minutes, and I still couldn't get them on : (	negative
Phone fell out of my back pocket and shattered the screen with the first drop.	negative
So Iam in the EXACT Same Predicament as previous Reviews have stated.. One of the ball joints came in the standard yellow moog original box.. However the second one came in an All White box with a small moog sticker.. Heres the problem the second one is NOT BRAND NEW IT LITERALLY WAS DIRTY AND QUITE CLEARLY WAS LESS THAN PERFECT REFURBISHED SUB STANDARD GARBAGE..	negative
Love Jodi and love this book. It’s helped me overcome so much!! I’ve tried so many things and her book anxiety 0 you 1 and this workbook has done wonders for my life. Thank you Jodi:)	positive
Just what I was looking for.	positive
I have 4 large indoor dogs so our main living area can smell foul at times. I was sick of scented candles, diffuser sticks, air spray, etc. I love this large capacity diffuser and the essential oils really help eliminate dog odors. The timer feature is a real perk as well as the large volume capacity so I don’t have to refill so often. Well worth the price	positive
It's too tight to get it out smoothly.	negative
This product is very easy to install, but the glass is terrible quality. I had a small area begin cracking within the first 12 hours. Then on the third day after installing, there are four separate areas around the edges that are cracking/showing a spider web effect. The phone has not been dropped or mishandled since the screen protector was applied. Waste of money, will be buying a different product.	negative
Although the story adds little to our store of knowledge about the Middle Ages and few surprises, it is an entertaining tale.	positive
These were supposed to be Necco conversation hearts. They were not. Terrible flavors, misleading description of product.	negative
nly for super small flashlight	negative
Acting was horribly done...seen better high school actors. I love horror movies but don't waste your hard earned cash on this piece of junk!	negative
My frame arrived with a dented bar. I emailed for a replacement repeatedly receiving not one response. I am unable to assemble it without the properly fitting bar. The frame is still in pieces on the floor. I am a trapeze artist I needed the frame for practice. Wouldn't recommend this product, the company.	negative
"I ship coffee mugs and need 12"" squares of large cell bubblewrap. This product is time consuming for my small business since I have to actually cut the bubblewrap even though it is perforated for tearing. I will not buy this again."	negative
Would be better if the bungee sections were a bit longer, and the handle strap a bit shorter.	negative
Works well for holding loose leaf tea. Sleek look and convenient scoop which is held under the lid by a magnet so you don't lose it in the tea. I would recommend.	positive
I used this hose to connect my gas grill to my motorhome. Second trip out my wife smells propane. I opened up the compartment and got a strong smell of propane and heard the leak. Thankfully we caught this before disaster struck. Hose casing 2as split open and leaking badly.	negative
Not good quality at all 1st one we ordered the remote was broke so we sent it back ordered a second 1 and the steering was broke my son didn't even get to play with for 10 minutes	negative
I really loved the look of this case and my previous spigen cases have been great, but this one developed a crack from the slit for the credit card to the case within a week of getting it.	negative
It smells like plastic The consistency of this product is a bit watery, which is good for applying on skin but i would prefer something a little more thick than goop.	positive
I love the wonderful color and style about the product I really have a wonderful bathroom it's really nice everything came together nicey.I love my bathroom.	positive
Eh. Bought this for my boyfriend who is a beer lover. We tried them once for a room temp six pack and still had to wait for it to chill. I’d rather just give it an hour in the fridge instead.	negative
"This wasn't identified as a refurbished item, but it also wasn't listed as new either. Perhaps that simply means it wasn't ""certified refurbished"" as an indication of a quality refurbishment process. Mine had a defective battery which should have been caught in any refurbishment process."	negative
Didn’t like that you have to cut the dash insulation to make it fit, not the same as original equipment. Otherwise easy to install. What I did like is it was half the price from the dealer and it fixed the problem.	positive
Striker is a small but works	positive
The lights do absolutely nothing. Very disappointed with it.	negative
Didn't even shop up. Was refunded after a week and then the order was cancelled. I love amazon but I was dissapointed.	negative
So glad I bought this product, as I am getting compliments on my skin and hair. I put it in my morning tea and it melts quickly in it.	positive
The pair I got adds clearly audible noise to the signal. I hear the noise click on and off as the units starts and stops receiving a signal. I'm also not crazy about the asymmetric design, but maybe that's convenient for some people somehow. This might be the most negative review I've ever posted -- the pair I got are just barely tolerable due to the noise.	negative
These are not premium nor are they durable. My 14 week old puppy has destroyed all of them. I’ve given more ball hair cuts this week than I ever have before. Don’t waste your money. Stick with Kong.	negative
Super comfy, breathable, and best of all... squat proof!! These fit exactly as expected, sizing chart is accurate.	positive
Noise cancelling does not work! Earbud does not fit. Very unhappy with this product.	negative
Ours broke before we could even use it!	negative
I really love these undies! Perfect fabric and fit as expected. My only concern is the elastic quality... I wish there was a little bit more elastic.	positive
Poor quality fabric,very thin	negative
My 10-year old son receive the watch for Christmas. He wore it frequently and enjoyed its features. It works very similar to the Fitbit. However, the watch will no longer charge. The USB plug for the watch no longer works. Although it is considerably cheaper then the I wish it had held up longer.	negative
I have been using them for years. I put them under a cloth diaper at night - or when we will be out for extended periods. They hold a lot	positive
I got this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old. This car is fun and fast. However during the first ten minutes of use parts broke off and we are no longer able to steer the car. He was very disappointed and so was I. I would think an offroading remote control car would be plenty more durable but this is car is very fragile and parts break easily. I'm sending it back for a refund.	negative
Used both, screen was more than clean. Corners would not stay down on the first screen applied. Te second one the screen would not adhere near the home button. Would really like a refund.	negative
This was the best one of the three I tried for my 1999 F350 Superduty. Still had to add my own screw but could have been that my hood was a little off. This one sits securely	positive
For support to those who serve the line.	positive
Decent quality which is rare in a pair of glasses this cheap	positive
Buyer beware! Terrible. Look great but the third time I plugged my phone into the 10ft cord the charge tip came off and got stuck in my phone and I had a hard time getting it out. I would say all previous reviews are bogus.	negative
I wish it was a little louder, but it fits nice. I thought the speaker or spot with the buttons would be uncomfortable, but it was actually comfortable.	positive
The top when locked-in does not hold in place and if you try to carry with handle, the top would call me apart. wished I did not purchased this item. Thought it would go with the silicon bundt pan mold to transfer goods, but would not recommend this item.	negative
NEVER RECIVED THE ORDER HAD TO CANCEL AND BUY SOME WHERE ELSE.	negative
These seem strange at first, but I have grown to love them. They don't dry up. You know exactly how much life you have left on them. They are the only highlighter I use.	positive
Tried to pour gas today using the spout and it leaks before it even starts pouring gasoline. The mechanism to open the spout to pour is horribly designed. Better off just using a funnel and completely removing the cap.	negative
Sorry but this pencil did not work for me not if it is the lapis but does not work well write very cut and the lines are not continuous, I tried on several devices but always did the same.	negative
Pretty good. Did what they were suppose to do and my 3 year old likes squishing them.	positive
I removed a star because this case is beginning to fray at the edges, but I like this case because it keeps my paperwhite slim while still providing protection, and the style is simple but elegant.	positive
Does not really hold things in place feels like yoga pants... was looking for something more like spanks	negative
As soon as it arrives i tried it and it started smoking	negative
I bought this for my friend who just bought her first house and she loved. She keeps it at work and has gotten compliments on it. I would definitely recommend.	positive
Love the jacket, but the zipper was broken when delivered.	negative
Used for my two year kids ld twins during fireworks. Worked fantastic. One of them lies to wear them around the house now.	positive
Ordered a large, package said large but a small was inside the package. Totally useless to me.	negative
Nice, exactly what the ad said.	positive
One of the electrical connections on the back was damaged. This would have been dangerous to install!	negative
The description said the color was tan but the one i got was green. I had a hard time lining the edges up to close as the plastic was bent a little on the bottom half.	negative
Loved how fierce the female lead is. Would have given 5 stars had I known that there wasn't really a conclusion to this book because book 2 has the same issues.	positive
Greatest thing invented since man created cheese! 👍	positive
Set is packaged well and arrived promptly. Oil receptacles are sturdy; covers on each receptacle keep set neat--no spillage until time of lighting--great!	positive
Absolutely love the look and feel of these watershoes. They aren’t like any other watershoes I’ve seen before. I usually wear a US size 9 but after reading the other reviews, I’m glad I went with a smaller size (I got an 8.5 in these).	positive
doesn't seem to remove much of anything.	negative
use they lots. Do not need to carry the RFID case. Slim enough to fit in a small space without the bulk.	positive
I don’t care for the curved pick.	negative
I typically use a size 7.5. They didn’t have my size so I went up to a size 8. My toes fit great but the width was a little wider than I would like. I’m guessing a 7.5 would fit perfect. The material and quality is nice and durable. The color is just like shown in picture. Will review again if any issues come while wearing these more.	positive
Well made. Nice alternative to plastic. Pleasant scent in our opinion. Very pretty. Anti-static seems to be true. Noticeable difference. Only negative is that it may be hard to sculpt precise hairstyles due to its thickness and the teeth being closer together.	positive
These are incredibly soft. I use them for my children and they actually like them as is, so I don’t bother putting a second case over it. The zipper is tiny, but strong. Great product.	positive
Smells great and works great	positive
The motor burned out after 2 weeks. It just stopped working. Wasn’t abused, dropped squeezed or anything. Just doesn’t work anymore	negative
This product claims to work with most major brand pacifier but it doesn’t. Annoying	negative
Cute dress but a bit loose. I am 5'8, 145 lbs and usually wear a medium. I ordered a medium and it was very loose at the waist, it was boxy so I had to get it taken in. Other than that, I received a ton of compliments	positive
Worked great to start but fell apart quickly. Don’t waste your money.	negative
Bright. Lights up through your skin for dermatological uses (e.g. ingrown hairs). But the electronics are finicky and it goes on & off frequently when you move it. Verrrrry frustrating so I rarely use it anymore.	negative
It was difficult to store music & or videos.	negative
Love the look and ease of installation. No issue with radio stations in a small/medium town. Have not ventured into more rural areas but if issues are found when that occurs, I will update. Very satisfied with purchase.	positive
I loved that is an air popper. I bought mine in 2017. It is now not working well. It only can pop once, then you have to wait until the next day to do another use. So not good for popping for lots of popcorn at one. On the second use the kernals just sit there and burn. :(	negative
great design but poor quality. manufacture assembly wrong., some lights don't work.	negative
Doesn't help me sleep any better and it has started leaking sand or whatever is it in onto my bed.	negative
Not sure how warm these are but the XL size is fairly snug on my bairly xl hands. The liner is also not attached to the fingers. If you aren't careful taking them off the liner will pull out of the shell. Based on this I would not get them again.	negative
Didn’t work as good as I thought. Get the more expensive one	negative
Loved this pillow for the first few days. But after that the stitching started to come undone and I had to sew it. Wish it was a bit more durable.	negative
The spray is not as strong as I needed it to be but it works well on other things.	positive
Exactly as described.	positive
Some cotton liners are easy to deteriorate (like in an hour). This one stays longer without loosing its shape. The size is also good and wide.	positive
A little smaller than I expected, but it does a good job at thoroughly cleaning my brushes. Also makes the process go by faster.	positive
This product was not similar to the one I obtained from my dentist. The 35 percent was the same but the consistency was different. It burned my gums and made my teeth super sensitive	negative
I love the characters and town the authors have created. My favorite thing is the relationship between Cee-cee and her sisters. Great to read about a middle aged woman finding her truth and living her best life!	positive
I think this is just ok. Not a huge fan like the other's who have left reviews. It's very small, however not all that handy.	negative
Barely sticky and certainly won’t hoist up the girls at all. What a disappointment.	negative
The bracelet was lovely. I got it for a Friends birthday. Only problem was it came in bronze instead of silver and I had no time to returns still nice and nicely made	positive
Very cheap material.	negative
It works well enough as a soap. Consistency is good. I would probably give full stars except that I smell like I just washed my face with a can of Pledge furniture cleaner. It's a very strong, pungent scent and I'm really, really not a fan. I'll probably try a different scented one down the road but this one is a no go for me.	negative
I was not disappointed with this scope,quick sight in.	positive
Great feeling Bath mat. Good Quality. Only wish they made a larger size. would order several more.	positive
This measuring cup is good quality and is exactly as described.	positive
Phone works great, but the case is crappy. It's super slick and basically make the phone slide right out of your hand. So now I have a broken phone about a month after I bought it.	negative
Nice looking drapes. It is hard to find pinch pleated drapes these day so it was nice to find some at a decent price.	positive
Cute print however we haven’t finished the school year and the inside has ripped.	negative
The best book I have read recently! From the first page to the last I was engaged. The plot was centered around the witch trials but also about human relations. I loved that every once in awhile there would be a bit of information that would slightly change what I thought was the direction of the story.	positive
Super bright. Easy to use. I believe the wires should be heavier. But they work fine.	positive
Wanted to use these in a mason jar craft, but the battery box is so large there is no way to hide it with this small set of lights. Also, one set didn't work at all.	negative
Great book for what it was meant to inspire. It is simple and to the point. Great if you want a list of ideas to help you stay focused but not much deeper than that.	positive
So cute , unpackaged it, washed the crock. Filled in with chicken and plugged it in. It has a huge dent in the side, so mad:box wasn’t damaged so I assume it happened when packaged. A lot of money to pay for a damaged product!	negative
The sequence on the dress doesn't look anything like the picture. Dress is too long	negative
And of course sits on the skin surrounding your nostrils so there's no way to ignore it. Suggest buying locally as I will do from now on so I can see if the product smells too strong. This is listed on the box and in the Amazon ad as dermatologist tested, which to me implies it will contain only active needed ingredients for the described effect-- not lots of icky non-essential perfume scent.	negative
I liked the beginning of this movie a lot. The actresses who play the aunts are fantastic and really bring those characters to life. But beyond that, I got bored and the plot never went anywhere. I ended up fast-forwarding through the last 3rd of the movie because I just wanted the movie to be over at that point. I'm an adult. Kids, on the other hand, would probably like this movie and its interesting style of animation.	negative
The connection on the left headphone doesn’t work.	negative
WOULD NOT recommend this item. I have an average sized tub and even with using two bath bombs, the colors are not vibrant and neither is the scent. These bombs are very small, about golf ball size.	negative
Needed some notepads for the fridge and liked this design. They hold well and tear easily. Only complaint is that it’ll take us like 6 years to go through 6 pads. Wish they sold them in a smaller bundle.	positive
Great quality and it looks really nice. Relatively easy to put together and it is nice and sturdy.	positive
Love it. Nicely made.	positive
Too dark. Looks different then before.	negative
I love the scent and everything, but I probably won't buy it from this store again. It leaked in the packaging and was literally everywhere. Almost a 1/8 of it was gone because no one at their store bothered to make sure the lid was on all the way.	negative
We bought these for our son's daily lunch to reduce single-use plastic waste. They are very nice and quite large. The head is a bit shallow, so don't plan on using them for soup, but otherwise quite functional.	positive
I'll not finish the book since it just keeps going on and on... a little too many details, too complicated personalities and, in general, just too much of everything.	negative
Tastes and smells disgusting	negative
The product arrived as expected. However, the product did not taste fresh. I am used to receiving brittle in thin flat pieces, not blocks. That said, the product had a lot of the sugar at the bottom of the bag. Thanks	negative
Returned. Was nice, but not the style I wanted	negative
these cups are so cute. Worked well for my grandson's third birthday party as favors.	positive
Went for a long ride and the sissy bar completely detached from the bike and i lost it on the highway. very unreliable, this was only my second day with the sissy bar on the harley.	negative
Pump was missing, and the cow was filthy. What a disappointment.	negative
Followed the directions to the exact and had very minimal peeling. I tried it twice in a month span just in case and still almost nothing to peel and trust me my feet have plenty that should have peeled off. I won't but this product again.	negative
Pills were to large for me to swallow and taste was awful	negative
They are alright. I was disappointed because the pictures are misleading.They are regular shaped pants, not like the picture where the inseam is lower and rounded.	negative
"I bought these for my son. He said ""they work really well"" he does a lot of tailgating and home football parties. They keep your beer cold for a long time without using a beer cozy! I just ordered one for my brother for Christmas."	positive
Pretty thin. Won't work in dispenser.	negative
Thought I lost the first one I bought, but found it after I bought a replacement. No matter. I'm glad to have two in case anything happens to it. High quality construction. Ball bearing action is very smooth. Under priced for the quality.	positive
Cute, but the size was very small. Each fan could fit in the palm of my hand.	negative
Beautiful stationery! Got it so my granddaughter and I can write letters to each other. It’s perfect!	positive
The noise level is acceptable.	positive
I am very disappointed in this fan because when it is on oscillate it makes a clicking noise. I have tried tightening and loosening screws, made sure it’s clean and no matter what it makes this annoying noise. Otherwise the fan is great!	negative
This last Pure Stevia Powder that I ordered was not the same as usual. Definitely not nearly as sweet. I am having to use twice as much as before.	negative
I'll probably never use all these bars. I haven't used other bars, but I found these to work great.	positive
Good Value, pretty colors, kids and adults alike will love them.	positive
LOVE this case! It’s feminine, just the right amount of bling and the perfect rose gold tint. It protects my phone well, the buttons work great and the price is right! Highly recommend.	positive
I installed three of these bulbs on Saturday and one burnt out by Sunday evening.	negative
It is hit or miss with connecting!	negative
Detail for the mask was great. Used it as a costume for my son (pre teen) and it was a little big, but it states it’s for an adult. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong rubber smell. I washed it with soap 3 time, made a baking soda paste and used that 3 times. Finally I made a baking soda paste with essential oils and that made it to where the smell was tolerable	positive
Done a wonderful activity. This is a great book for anyone fighting the concern that I have taken my thoughts. Will probably prescribe this book to my loved one. I really appreciate this book.	positive
I go through so much of this stuff because of how many gallons my tank is and the constant need to change part of the water every few weeks minimum. This is the cheapest per ounce supplier I’ve found and it comes straight to my door.	positive
Returned. Screen started malfunctioning within 1 week	negative
Lasted less than two months before it quit working. Let’s water through when shut off. Yes, I know how to adjust the nut. All positions leak. Not worth paying to return. Save yourself a headache, buy a better brand.	negative
"As the other reviewers pointed out, these ""pebbles"" are larger than the stated 1-2 inches. Then again, that is exactly why I ordered these - I wanted the larger size. They also aren't as glossy as the pictures show - also stated in the other reviews and also what I wanted. So basically I got what I wanted - but more because of the other reviews than the actual product description."	positive
Left side stopped working after 2 weeks.	negative
I would say everything is great, all I dislike is it is too small for me.	positive
cute case! my computer has a case on it as well and fits great right inside!	positive
Great quality... not 1 ripped and the kids were handling	positive
This was highly disappointing. When i first received it...i pull the string and it went back in. I put on the machine and pull the string once and it sound like something just broke off in it...it would not pull the string in. Took it off and try again and it would not pull back...sound like the spring broke and came apart...remember, one pull...that sucks. This product does not have a screw to try resetting the coil. This is ashame. Waste on money.	negative
Sent me the wrong picture, I got the spa scene one and gave it away, will not be buying pictures from you. It’s really bad when they get the order wrong with no return address	negative
Bought this product to keep my axolotl tank a few degrees cooler. It was very easy to assemble but it did not turn on at all. ill be returning this product.	negative
Well packaged in a box, packing around item in sealed plastic however arrived broken. I felt it was possibly and probably broken prior to shipping and the product was shipped anyway. Items looks as described but I have not taken it out of the plastic packaging yet to really look at because I am still wondering if it is worth the trouble to return it, verses attempting to have success gluing it back together.	negative
I like the excellent value and price of this brush. I often grill. I use them to bake barbecue sauce on pork and chicken wings. The length and heat resistance are very good! There are easy to clean, the best benefits of the brush head can be changed, do not worry about need to spend money to buy	positive
I have used several expensive glass protectors and they never left so many bubbles as these cheap ones. Very disappointed but they were cheap.	negative
I've been looking for a nice casual dress like this for a long time and finally found it! It fits me perfectly and I'm really happy I've accidentally trapped on it!	positive
4 stars because the material is a bit stiff rather than flowy, but overall very pretty and still comfy!	positive
Keeps my hot drink hot for hours. Doesn’t retain odor if you forget to rinse it for a day or two (as sometimes happens with me). Very easy to clean the cap.	positive
Holds toys perfectly. I only knocked off one star bc one of the hooks that came with it doesn't adhere to the tile easily, the other works very well. Other than that, great product	positive
This is my first review . I was skeptical about buying a refurbished PC because of all of the bad reviews about how dirty refurbished PCs came. I was amazed! It was packaged like a brand new PC except for the inclusion of a setup manual. While I generally don't like small form factor desktops this one works great and has everything you want. I upgraded the OS to to the Windows 10 May 2019 edition without a hitch.	positive
Junk. Not genuine Thirstystone. One stuck to the bottom of my glass, fell off and broke. Junk!	negative
Returned. I found most of the pages were about mom and dad than baby	negative
Not very sturdy. Wood cracks very easily. Not really worth the money. I'm going to have to do a lot of reinforcing it to make it a good coop for my ducks..	negative
Good jokes for a youngster to enjoy!	positive
This outfit does not fit well, it is too small. The fabric is very nice though and would look good if it fit better	positive
This was perfect for my son to wear at a vow renewal on the beach!	positive
very breathable socks but they WILL shrink. definitely order a size up	positive
THIS PIECE OF CRAP DOES NOT WORK NEVER EVER	negative
"added ""shoe goo"" where cable connects to plugs. maybe this will help it to not separate"	positive
I'm a foster parent for shelter kittens and need lots of toys for them to play with. This was a great selection at a good price.	positive
They broke within 10 minutes of using them, both of them not just one. I wish I could get a refund because it was complete crap.	negative
Not a fan of this at all. I have worn Angel for years and can verify that this does NOT smell like the real deal. Disappointed that it is non returnable	negative
I brought some salt lamps on clearance have the European cord needed replacement. I have order the butterfly clip but the base sat on the cord and is not even I have to put padding to raise the bottom up. So this time order already come with the base.	positive
"Nice large strong case BUT thought would be in red for easy spotting in suitcase. It's black with red interior. Also thought there'd be pockets/compartments-is just a large headphone case with a small mesh ""packet."" Eh."	positive
The color is not the same as the photo. It’s green like super green not sea foam but teal... didn’t match my decor, will be returning.	negative
This item was sent to me damaged. It seems as if it was already worn. Don’t waste your money on it.	negative
After a month of using this product the nozzle fell off and I have to continue to replace it. In all fairness I did buy two, one solo and 1 in a set. I'm pretty sure that this one is just defective.	negative
THE WORST PIECE OF GARBAGE I EVER BOUGHT.....THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE AN EXCUSE NOT TO ALLOW IT TO BE RETURNED................	negative
I really wanted to buy them in black instead of blue. It just looked like black color in the picture. But they work okay	negative
This was just what I needed. I used the top for my daughter's cheer trophies, and the hooks across the bottom to hang her metals. It was easy to install, comes with all hardware needed, and looks very nice. I liked it so much I ordered a second.	positive
for over the stove it is not really enough light unless you put maybe all 3 in a row...but excellent for over doors when walking into a dark room	positive
Beautiful cleaning mat. High quality, great texture. The reverse side has a grip-like texture that keeps the thing in place. Rolls up nicely. Informative infographics.	positive
cheap. broke without even using them!	negative
Poorly made, when try to assemble, holes are not aligned properly...	negative
I really like this shelve. My husband does not have a closet space in our rooms and before 1/2 of his clothes were on the floor. Not anymore, with space still. ❤️	positive
The game is alright but it wasn’t what I wanted	negative
I love the look of this and it’s so cute but it falls off often and I don’t notice and then I am having to look around and find it because it has fallen off. I wish it would lock around the bands or something so it didn’t fall off	negative
These screen protectors have a matte anti-glare quality but the matte glare seems just as visually instructive as a shiny glare. I thought these would be easy to apply since there are no touch screens or cameras to fit them around, but it was equally tricky. You have to line up the rounded corners just so, so take your time. My care also snags the edges of the screen protector sometimes, which makes the corners not stick as firmly.	positive
It's a solid brick and nothing rubs off onto your skin, no matter how hard you try to scrub. Threw it away.	negative
First one I rec'd didn't fit. They sent a replacement out right away; however it turned my wrist green so now I can't wear it...money wasted.	negative
Good little instructional..	positive
Part was similiar to OEM, but was not the same. Black piece was different and did not slide up into place. Tab broke off upon installation. Had to use original black piece with new gray handle and zip tie into place. Dissapointed to say the least since I was trying to fix my Father-in-Law's truck.	negative
the lid is loose, doesn’t blend well at all. It just sucks so much. You get what you pay for.	negative
Package arrived on time. However, both glass were destroyed. The 2 pieces of bubble wrap were completely deflated/punctured. 2 stars only because I've ordered this before and never had an issue.	negative
First of all, they took a long time to get to me. They come with no instructions. No way of knowing when they are fully charged. Charge doesn't last long, at all. And they scratch very easily. Very disappointed with this product unfortunately.	negative
Very helpful in keeping tract of the next book to read	positive
Unacceptable just revived it and the first zipper I try to open breaks. Simply disappointed. One star because it does not let me give less.	negative
Great packaging, nice and sleek product. I haven't used it long enough yet to know how it will work but it is well made and I believe it will do as it says!	positive
Meat is so hard & tough. Not for senior dogs missing teeth. Even heating it won't soften it. Don't understand why each variety is so hard to cut in pieces. I understand that switching dog foods can cause upset tummy but her stomach made noises all night & she vomited it up in the morning. Will try again to introduce this food into her diet but I'm apprehensive.	negative
This potty seat is cute but i really dont recommend it for potty training. It slides all over the seat and isnt secure at all and makes my son nervous. Because it is not secure and slides around, it also means my son cant climb onto the potty by himself without help. Also, pee seems to get in between the cushion and the plastic which is gross and impossible to clean. I really want to return this because it was also missing pieces upon arrive and over all not a good product at all.	negative
"I just received our ""Deluxe"" model from UPS. I opened the box only to find the small 3-hole version. I would have just written this off as a mistake but, reading the reviews I found someone else had the same problem. This smells like a bait and switch from the supplier. I am sending it back for my refund."	negative
Needed a cheap Bluetooth device for my desktop, this works well	positive
Baby loves it. Could have more traditional songs tho	positive
We use them in a trail mix recipe. I found that with this batch, I picked out the fresher ones.	positive
Absolute unit this flashlight is. My only complaint is that main times the flashlight turned itself on in my backpack, because the button is extremely easy to accidentally press. Also, when it's used to the point that the battery is about to die, the flashlight gets REALLY hot. I don't mind it, but for some, this may be problem. Also, the strap is useless. Throw it away, or leave it in the box. It will fail you, and you'll drop the flashlight.	positive
Love this case! The wood grain is amazing and the craftsmanship is outstanding. I have gotten so many compliments including several C level execs at the company I work for.	positive
Gorgeous but runs much smaller than others I have purchased recently from The exact same place so will have to gift to my daughter who has smaller feet	negative
They charge fully in about 2 days and seem to work as well as regular non-rechargeable batterries.	positive
Very cute. My granddaughters love stickers and will love these books for Christmas!	positive
Sometimes it makes my wrist itch but it was a good value	positive
Cheaply made, doesn't pair half the time, and the sound cuts in and out a lot.	negative
Holes did not align properly, warped. Had no time to send back and reorder. Made it work with zip ties.	negative
I highly recommend this book for the reader who wants to suspend disbelief and take an intellect and spiritual ride. Lots to consider and learn. I've already got plans to read more of his work.	positive
This is inexpensive and, to the extent that it is a it smaller, preferable to the more expensive big-name products. However I found the left-right buttons to be rather squishy and uncomfortable. Like all arc mice, I also wish it would work while flat, as I find that less stressful on the hand. One remark: I wish the listing states that it does not come with batteries (2 x AAA), so I would have been prepared.	positive
I ordered 3 of these table cloths. I hv a six foot table and they did not go around the table	negative
Wasnt into the chain, and the zipper is a little rough, but it was happily accepted, would recommend, would buy again	positive
update, used to shrink a quilt but its been a month since i shrunk it and the seal opened and let all the air in. quality not great	negative
Great color, quality and style.	positive
Was a gift, recipient didn't like it. Seller refunded $ as soon as product was received by seller.	negative
Most of the cuttings in this shipment were dying of rot	negative
Very easy set up, and works very well. Only reason I'm not 5 stars is the drive seems slower than I expected. Quality and appearance is really good, but a bit faster would be nice. I use this drive every day, and I'm typically using an SSD, so my view of speed may be a bit warped. I've been using SSD for a long time so my expectations for speed on a portable drive may be somewhat unrealistic. I definitely recommend this drive.	positive
Honestly bought this for a one-off gag and i intended on throwing it out after getting some laughs out of it but it has quickly become a favorite blanket for visitors to wrap themselves in. Loses on star for being blank on the underside though. It really shows the moment the blanket isn't cleanly laid out. Definitely recommend the largest size	positive
I found this practice skin to be valuable in my FNP education and felt like it helped me practice suturing well!! The material is durable and allows for multiple upon multiple attempts and is forgiving when it comes to skill. The differing shapes and curves allows you to practice all types of suturing and even allows for tight pull!	positive
It works and has a medium aggressiveness. Also it's definitely a lighter razor. The part that feels cheap is the plastic casing over the handle. While it doesn't wiggle while shaving, it can wiggle if I want it to to (which I don't). With all the other options on Amazon with complete metal construction I'd look elsewhere.	negative
Put it in my bathroom in front of shower	positive
This connected easily to my phone and I generally liked it. I returned it because several people told me they couldn't hear me clearly and because it would not automatically disconnect from my phone when I turned off my car even after several minutes. I would be sitting in my office trying to answer a call only to realize it was connected out in my vehicle. Not a good impression to make to clients. I don't recommend it.	negative
Will only charge phone if placed sideways and shoved all the way into the watch charger where you can place the watch. Can’t charge phone standing up. If phone shifts the smallest amount phone doesn’t charge overnight. Do not waste your money!	negative
The other cases I got from the phone store already had a crack in them after two weeks and were twice as expensive as these. Even if you only have one phone, it's great to have backups just in case.	positive
This is one of my favorite earbuds so far. I’ve received a blue one and the left earbuds doesn’t work. It only works on the right one. I’m so disappointed:( Might have to ask for refund	negative
My 9-year-old daughter loved this. Her dad and me...? Not so much. Super cheesy and unrealistic with terrible dialogue and major plot holes. A charity event where actual bags of cash are handed out instead of the giant ceremonial check...? A Chinese puppy buyer who wants the dogs for their coats (because he can't get dogs in China apparently)....? Bully dogs with a variety of (racist) accents...?	negative
I love this snack. I first had them on a Delta flight	positive
Fits and nice price, Longevity?	positive
I am a Chef 15+ years. Hands down the most gorgeous set and with proper care will last a lifetime. Holds an edge well, easy to sharpen and the scissors can cut thru bone.	positive
As another reviewer noted, I purchased a new disc from seller Tru Inertia but received a disc that had clearly been played with before, carrying numerous wear marks on the plastic. My wear is similar to the photos in his review so I'm not taking the time to document them here. Hopefully it plays well and becomes a new favorite putter anyway.	negative
Great product! Good quality and exactly as advertised!	positive
The dress was very cute and very flattering but the color with the polka dots in person was reading more as a night gown than I fun summer dress.	positive
Very time consuming to wax large areas, but it hurts badly than other waxes.	negative
I liked the noise it made when moved. It was not “giant”	positive
"A 20 mph wind gust caused this ""windproof"" umbrella to snap a support joint, cause a tine to disconnect from the edge, and rip the stitching on 3 more....and then invert like a movie prop. I will give it points for being huge! 2 people can easily use it, as long as it is not windy outside."	negative
It's nice, but very, very small. Not anywhere close to the color or size pictured.	positive
Wish it would have indicate light so I would know its charging or not, or when it’s done charging. Other than that I do like it.	positive
This is not for windows it’s definitely a shower curtain	negative
These are not as strong as what I have purchased before. Husband complains because he chews them up into little pieces. Bad Habit........	negative
Only had it for a couple of days. Working great	positive
Good fit for our unit. Arrived quickly.	positive
Terrible quality. Looks great at first but then all of them started peeling in one month! I also didn't even use it every day. Must of worn it for a total of 7 days, 2 of them have only been used for 3 days or so. Missed the return window by one day as well. So disappointed especially since we bought 3.	negative
I paid to get 2 boxes of 100 and I only got 1. Not only that I can't find where to contact the seller!! I purchased 1 box before and I was happy with my purchase. Not this time.	negative
Very cute but you should order a size up. It's very skin tight. Very sexy. But I would wear it out more if it wasn't as skin tight as it is.	positive
I thought the shirt would be a army green color but the shirt is black/gray/white. Not cute at all. I wanted it for Memorial Day but returned it.	negative
This book was worth the read. It Seemed to drag a bit as it took forever for Breckenridge and Heather to get to their real feelings of love....	positive
I thought it would be much heavier. Is very difficult to vacuum, sweep or clean.	negative
Same product you can purchase for the same price at Sephora	positive
This product is very good just as advertised Until the third or fourth use. It's like the contents drys up or just won't come out There is no advance wheel or button and there does not seem to be a way to get the liquid onto the brush after the third or forth use I have three of these pens and each one acts the same after a couple uses. Terribly disappointed Anyone else have this problem??	negative
These bulbs are bright but don’t give that nasty blinding glare to oncoming vehicles .	positive
I purchased this because we have started doing vinyl work. This really helps pick words and small cuts. My only complain is it does not mount to my table - mount not wide or deep enough. Have mounted it to the back of a chair. Really enjoy being able to adjust light brightness. Takes a little getting use to looking through magnifying glass though.	positive
Can be used for surf or high pressure but for easy things is nice	negative
Super easy install and really bright. Feels cheaply made but still works. One of the 4 came incomplete without the part that screws in to the fixture and another came broken	negative
It's a dehumidifier. It works well.. Need I say anything else?	positive
Hose material after one year became cracked and I had to replace. Tank was covered with a hard plastic cover all the time.	negative
These are adorable hooks but tend to fall off the rod when you move the curtain back.	negative
I really like these earrings. They are cute and don't irritate my sensitive ears.	positive
Even free, this app is useless and worth the $0 I paid for it. Deleted.	negative
Looks like in the picture. It protects my laptop very well. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to use the tablet mode. It’s a great product, however, you can’t increase the degree between keyboard and screen more than 45-50 degrees or the laptop will tilt back a little due to the weight.	positive
This is one of my favorites from Shea Moisture. I use it after a henna treatment and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.	positive
Awesome Product! Very comfortable when used with our exercise balls (that we use as office chairs). Will likely order more. It misses 1 star because of price. There's no way a half-cylinder of foam wrapped in fleece should cost more than $10	positive
We have a Yorkie and she loves to chase them. She can't destroy them like other bouncy balls.	positive
It's a good product when it works. The adhesive wasn't the problem it was the ring itself. Screw got stripped 2 months after purchase and now it's useless.	negative
Great series. Just too bad there weren’t more episodes.	positive
I cannot stand the taste and had to cut it in half in order to drink it. That being said, it does what it’s supposed to do and helps with my am workout. Unfortunately the taste is going to keep me from purchasing again.	positive
This will fall apart... the upright poles/supports do not stay threaded and the whole thing (I have multiple) will list to the side and just be a wonky piece of crap. Spend the money the first time around and only cry once... I’m having to ditch these and buy another set of higher quality ones.	negative
Soft case. I don’t like bulky cases so I bought this since it looked slim and it is. Easy to put on. I like that I can put it in my pocket and it doesn’t get stuck on whatever fabric I am wearing.	positive
This was perfect for my kids' room. We were trying to maximize the floor space for playing and this hamper tucks away nicely in the corner.	positive
Easy to use, although it took a bit to find the right spot, after that it was great!	positive
Nice little portable mobile for crib or car seat. Fits well with crib but not so well on playpen due to the round side railing. Only thing missing is the different volume options.	positive
Covers nicely with sprayer	positive
"The thread is not NPT/ American Thread for 1/2 ."" It does not fit my drop ear and have to return."	negative
I used this product prior and was not impressed. Had to go on diet for medical purposes and tried it again and loved it! Great option to sweeten my Green tea. Husband is a diabetic and loves it as well.	positive
The author knows what he wrote about it.	positive
Didn’t work for my 16 months old baby. He still sucks his thumb even if I just put a few coats on his nail. Sad.	negative
So far this is working in just 2 weeks but it’s hard to take every single day brings a lot of acne	positive
When I order from Amazon, one of my pet peeves is returning products that doesn’t fit or work. This product is a perfect fit for my specific phone. Installing was easy because the instructions are clear. The quality is superb. This is the first time I ordered from this company. I am open for future products!	positive
This top is soo cute! I wore it on a date to a bar and I was getting multiple compliments about the top from the women there. I am a big girl and it made me feel beautiful. I will definitely buy another one.	positive
It was good and I would purchase again. Not all my dogs loved it but at least it worked for two of them. It files the nails slowly and safely. Doesn’t make a ton of noise.	positive
I thought I will use for water so that i don’t have to use too many plastic bottles but it failed. It leaks all the time no matter how we set up. Don’t buy!! Not worth with price u pay.	negative
Charged fairly fast and lasted all day on portable beats speaker! . I timed them lasting 6 hours at nominal volumes on the same speaker/device so they outlasted the competition 6 months later yhey stopped charging	negative
I chose this book to read because I read the giver and I really liked it so if u like the giver then give this book a try.	positive
This product does nothing to help dissipate heat in the PS4 game console.	negative
The shears are sharp and work really well. I love the clips and the thinning shears as well. I don’t like the fact that the circles in the handles do come out easily, but other than that really good for the money.	positive
Fingers are tight and the fur isn't as fluffy as I thought it would be	positive
This bag was so cute and I absolutely loved it and hope the child I purchased it for enjoys it with her supplies also. The only reason for 4 stars is because it was smaller than I realized so I got a supplemental backpack. So cute though!	positive
Did not work well, they just got bent and the furniture was not very heavy.	negative
The bottom cracked soon after I put it on my laptop. The case barely stays on and it definitively doesn’t protect my laptop. The case is inexpensive but still isn’t worth the price	negative
This needs to be redesigned to enable the hitch pin to be engaged as you fold upwards. Right now you can't fold up without removing hitch pin first. Bad design.	negative
Perfect for myself needed more water to keep me from dehydrating. I have the bottle goal to keep me going	positive
I have ordered before and I wasn't disappointed. Great product. It fits just as it says and its very comfortable. I have not had a problem like I have had with other products such as this.	positive
This toner seems to be working fine in my printer.	positive
Smells great, a little bit irritating to my skin but not my family's.	positive
Horrible cracked within the first week	negative
Bought this for my daughter and what should have been an easy set up took over an hour as the poles were to thick to fit into the connectors. I had to shave quite a bit off to make it fit which was very frustrating. After finally getting it all put together, it is a nice goal and perfect size. Don't think I would buy again or recommend this though. The price was too high for not fitting right.	negative
I’ve purchased batteries before from amazon and they were not fully charged. I figured I would try again. As soon as these new batteries arrived, I tested one with a battery charger. They were significantly below a fresh charge. I’m not sure what the issue is with buying batteries through amazon or if I’ve just been unlucky twice.	negative
Very cheap material. Nearly tore during first use.	negative
Way underpowered for the price. I would think that this would be better priced around $100.	negative
Never really fits well, blows off easily. Who really wants to run a strap under to hold it on, when it has elastic corners?	negative
I suffer with chronic pain especially in my neck and back. I have tried every kind of pillow out there only to end up with more pain and suffering. I slept on my new pillow for the first time last night and it was the BEST sleep I've had in a really long time!!! I know it has only been one night and maybe too early to review it but that one night made quite an impression and I'm looking forward to many more nights like it!!!	positive
Go to the dollar store and get a kids paint brush it would literally be better than this JUNK! Bamboozled AGAIN!	negative
When I received the dress there were multiple staples left in the dress.... very strange. The dress is cheaply made but to be expected for $70. Haven't decided if I'll keep it or not yet.	negative
I bought this item for the drill tapered gauge portion of the tool. The angled surface was not cut or stamped straight. I will need to machine the surface true on the milling machine. The only reason I bought this is to avoid spending $40 or more dollars for a name brand. Product is not made in the USA but I expected that from the other postings. It was only ten dollars and will give me a quick project to correct the problem.	negative
I bought the Westcott Stainless Steel Office Ruler with Non Slip Cork Base 6-Inch and the Westcott 6-Inch Clear Shatterproof Ruler because I was looking for a compact ruler to fit into a pen case both are good quality and came in perfect condition. The metal one was a Blue tint not stainless color but I'm fine with that. Great Price and value. As far as the sticker removal it was not a problem, I used WD-40 and was careful when removing the sticker and any residue.	positive
Just as described and worked wonderfully	positive
I really liked the idea of it but it didn't work out for my job, kept knocking it off my hardhat. Should've kept my money..	negative
See other pictures that people have submitted, this case was made ever so slightly too small and doesn’t fit over the right side where the Apple Pencil charges and additionally makes the buttons really hard to press. Definitely returning.	negative
I feel good Surprise delivery The most professional service. everything is fine. We liked it, we bought it twice. Excellent	positive
horrible, not strong enough to froth the milk once it goes into the liquid. I would return it but apparently it’s not eligible? Sometimes you lose. I tried another brand that didn’t work either so my interested I taking another chance. Perhaps Amazon should do some quality control or due diligence.	negative
This has been a furniture saver. We adopted a rescue dog who had apparently been allowed on all the soft surfaces . This keeps her out without having to monitor her all the time. It looks very nice too.	positive
Poor design- lid isn’t tight seal so water from shower went directly into the bottle through the pump mechanism	negative
Very well done a pleasure to read. Finally a sub novel that is more than real. It does a brave job for the men of the silent service thanks	positive
We were not able to install this handle because there was an extra piece of metal preventing it from setting correctly.	negative
Just used this for 5 weeks and spring become loose, I'm afraid to loose my phone someday.	negative
I love nag Champa but all of the scents smelled exactly the same. Still smelled good though.	negative
My son loves his backpack . The size is just perfect and comfy for kids .	positive
Great product. Giving it 4 stars because most of my bras are a bit wider and although these fit into the hook and eye the strap itself was a little narrow. No one will ever know.... it allows me to use great bras that were too tight	positive
When I started wearing this product my skin got rash and itched it the area that caused me and irritated spending and getting worst. I don't know why this product has this problem it costs me other money to my the medicine for itching and getting a rash. My skin got pilled when I itched the area and it causing me a lot of problem with this product.	negative
I like the plug phones just fine they just didn’t last very long for the money.I have used for a short period of time and one side quit working.	negative
I purchased this for use during a UK trip, I live in the US. Yes, I needed an adapter to plug it into the outlet but that is not the issue. The USB ports do not supply a clean power for charging phones. This was tested on four separate iPhones and all yielded the same results, poor charging and an inability to use the phone while charging. If I used the power blocks supplied by Apple, it charged fine and the phone could be used while charging. My suggestion is to avoid this all together.	negative
To small, flaked a lot	negative
THIS WAS NOT THE REAL THING , IT WAS A FAKE, WAS OF MY TIME . NOTIFY AMAZON WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT GETTING A REFUND. NO SATIN WHITE RIBBON, NOT EVEN IN SWAROVSKI BOX BUT A KNOCK OF OF A BOX. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.	negative
The best expandable hose we have placed our hands on. Tough built.	positive
The setting buttons are way too sensitive. Even a phone cable grazing the base will cause the lighting to change from one setting to the next. Not really practical if, like me, you keep it on a nightstand where you might also charge a phone or set a book down and accidentally brush one of the buttons	negative
Canister was shipped quick but the canister box inside the shipped box looked to have been used or tampered with as I am missing two metal lid clips so rendering the canister not water tight. I see I can purchase some on amazon for like $8 but still annoying. I have had this canister before so i know it works great but annoying i have to now wait longer before i can use.	positive
While I have never had a bad hydro flask, this one has a very strong metal smell when I drink from it. It is really weird. I washed it with hot soapy water and am trying to soak it tonight. Not sire how to get rid of the smell, but if I can't I will be returning it.	negative
First time I plugged something into it, the red plastic protector strips inside broken and jammed. After 2 more uses, the same thing happened to another of the sockets. Now there's broken off pieces (, any maybe metal springs) in the device... not something you want with mains electricity. It's so flimsy.	negative
Excellent light with a wide range of color and effects.	positive
I bring goodies to work a lot so I’ve already used this quite a bit. I accidentally spilled some mix on the pan and it baked on but it was so easy to clean off. I definitely recommend!	positive
Pretty. Festive. Overpriced	positive
Item is not working right. Cannot adjust and it will not add any more devices. I want to return this item for refund.	negative
Ruined my printer the yellow spread through to all my other colors. I hope this eventually cleans out of my printer. It worked ok for my paper prints at first but after 2/3 weeks it started smearing black and now yellow. It’s definitely not for printing on labels.	negative
I like that you can treat both cats and dogs with this product. I didn't like that I didn't know who made it until today.	positive
Did not meet description. Did not include stand. Did not work when it was plugged in, only the display came on then turned off.	negative
I just opened my order and the Fuji INSTAX film is missing.... that was the main reason I ordered this item(because it was a complete set) and it did not come. Don’t trust the reviews. This seller is a scammer	negative
The blue tooth doesn't work:(	negative
"The mount actually broke and my 65"" Samsung LED Tv fell straight down my stairwell and put holes in the walls on both sides of the stairwell and nearly killed my fiance as she was walking down the stairs when it happened. I Want a refund on the product and I want my tv replaced. This was very scary and expensive."	negative
This stuff is not worth the money for the amount you get its like buying a can of under seal and if the surface is not cleaned perfectly it doesn't stick and peals off.	negative
So comfortable it makes putting on a regular underwire or push up seem like torture and gives such great shape and support, they are all I ever want to wear. However padding bunches up and gets misshapen very easily.	positive
This vacuum works great and it is very easy to move around while in use. I’ve had shop vacs that have very stiff hoses and this one is great. This size is perfect for me. My only comment is that the manual does not address everything. But I can figure it out.	positive
Whoever designed this product never rode a bike. Very difficult to mount and it did not fit 3 of my road bikes. Very clumsy to recharge. And bad angle when I could mount it. I returned it. I do not recommend. I found two other bike rear lights that work great.	negative
The cushions are poorly made, the ties are not evenly spaced, not in line with the cushion. There are sewing gaps where the cushions are put together. Color is the only positive. Very poor quality!	negative
I was excited to find some reasonably priced coin rolls, because let's be real, who really wants to pay for these anyway? But upon putting the pennies in one of these wrappers, I noticed there is barely enough extra to fold over the ends. So I guess I'll be taping both ends until I use these up. Don't waste your money on these!	negative
Great for cooking, durable, easy to clean, well worth the money.	positive
Works Ok, but if you were light color clothing or under clothing, it will turn it black	negative
Definitely worth the money	positive
I really like the fit of this shirt, I purchased the navy & green plaid one. I washed it before wearing and I can tell it's going to pill, one wash and the fabric is pilling. If it doesn't get worse with every wash it will be ok, but I don't like the pilling and fading of this after just one wash. It's not going to stand up to washing & wearing that I can see.	negative
I ordered this for my 6th generation ipod touch, that I bought for business purposes. It is very sturdy and protects the ipod well. I definitely feel it will protect it well.	positive
They are a gift, so I don't know if they will wash well.	positive
Great for root clipping overnight. And they get tangled less than others because their 2 prongs with nothing in between them.	positive
Went on easy, however did not contain guide stickers as described in the instructions.	positive
Purchased this for my sister who is a big aroma therapy fan. The beads are lovely and very colorful. It's definitely better worn as a necklace. If your wrist is on the smaller size you'll be stuck between twice wrapped being too big but not big enough to get the 3rd wrap around.	positive
It is an excellent product	positive
It's a great band, I'm very happy with the style and weight. Classic look and great conversation starter.	positive
So far these cartridges are doing the job and saving me money! I am very happy and will order these again.	positive
Fits perfectly not tight but for some reason my straps still be rolling even though it's broader straps. Plus size ladies it will fit 400lbs + and I rock the 5x and I am broad at the top	positive
Maybe the rechargeable battery was bad? I powered the battery until the green light indicator went on but fan would not work. Green light indicator went off after short while so no charge held. Returned to Amzn for store credit.	negative
Perfect replacement for my Aircon a/c. It even has more features than the factory remote. Found out it works will all my Aircon units.	positive
Shirt is nice and is as expected but the odor that it comes with is so strong it stinks up the room it's in. Even after washing it, the odor still remains.	negative
The clip broke the second day I had it.	negative
I bought these for my brother's house and he liked it it helps woth the mosquito and flys	positive
Good movie, but too many labels were put on it and it was tore.	positive
This is pretty big . Works great	positive
Great Quality, use it in school and on the school bus	positive
I NEVER received this item. I was charged a first time for this and the package got lost. Weeks later they re-shipped this and charged me again and yet again I didn't receive it. My order was placed on January 30th and till this day I am charged twice and have no package..... -_-*	negative
Thrilled that it has no aluminum, but does nothing to prevent underarm body odor after sweating.	negative
I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett and both together makes this movie fantastic. One of my all time favorites.	positive
Very pretty, will only fit 2 cards if u shove them in, but then u need the jaws of life to get them back out. Cracked after only a couple weeks....needless to say I only had it for a little over a month before I had to order a new one.	negative
It is absolutely beautiful... The only downfall is the way the glass was blown at the top didn't loop in the center and it hangs crooked.	positive
I like the colors. Exactly what I expected	positive
WOW, This little thing is freaking AWESOME! Talk about a 20 second workout?! This thing will shock you on how fast your legs will BURN... you will think they are on fire... oh yeah, and the next day you will feel your stomach muscles crying out for help! ♡ I LOVE THIS STEPPER! ♡ Perfect workout for a Trucker who is health conscious like us!!	positive
I use this product with an iPad based photo booth that travels across the country. As you can imagine, lots of finger prints ends up the screen. This cloth works as advertised, and the container makes it even easier to keep up with it. I recommend it!	positive
The little hinge on the right ear piece on the all black pair broke after 3 months. I was walking out of Costco, and went to put them on, and I the rest of the frame fell on the ground, while I was just left holding the right ear piece. The hinge just cracked in half. I asked the seller to replace it, but they wouldn't, since it was outside of Amazon's 30 day returns period. The frames look good, but are of extremely poor quality.	negative
The thread is great. Trying to find the end of the thread is impossible.	negative
Works great but some times suction not always good	positive
Uncomfortable and runs very small	negative
The curtain itself is nice and looks great, the holding rings are pretty cheap and flimsy, not to mention don't snap in so retention is a problem, you might want to look into purchasing some quality show rings alongside this.	positive
Warranty process is misleading and unclear. Have asked for warranty replacement multiple times and only received automated responses.	negative
Fits in my 2011 Jeep. It is out of the way for shifting. Easy installation. Very pleased.	positive
My baby basically falls out of it if i dont seat him in a specific weird position.... i have tried everything including taking the whole thing apart and assembling it differently than instructed and it is a nightmare. I have a better swing at home (this was for my work) and would rather spend 3x the cost of this one fir something that actually does it’s job.	negative
Not pleased with this item. I bought a less expensive version and the tone feature was much louder which deterred our dogs from running away and we didn’t even need to use the shock. You can barely hear this one let along feel the vibration or shock.	negative
Best turmeric product I've tried. I got immediate relief!	positive
These filters fit my Navigator Delux perfectly and were far more economical than most others I’ve seen. Unfortunately the set I received was missing the flat round filters, only contained two large spongy filters and two square allergen filters. Disappointing.	negative
exact fit and works great	positive
I love this box, wonderful smell and could be used any way anywhere. Very sturdy.	positive
All were in great shape and work for making keychains	positive
The Spigen Thin Fit is in my rotation on every phone I buy.	positive
Starts flicker and loses brightness	negative
if i could afford it i'd treat these like daily vitamins and drink one every day. they're wonderful pick-me-ups after a rough night, and they don't taste bad (go away pepto, you suck). i'm prone to terrible hangovers and these make me feel like a human being again.	positive
Garbage! Crapped out in less than 6 months	negative
I have purchased this item multiple times with no issue until today. The box I received expired in mid-July, 2018. Nearly 5 weeks ago. Please check the dates on your box before discarding the cardboard. Very disappointed.	negative
Light quality was very low; suspect low CRI.	negative
Brought it yes ago and still using it. Though it is kind of flimsy and fragile (dents and bends really easy)	positive
The glasses are beyond cheap and feel almost paper thin. Multiple literally cracked while hand washing them.	negative
nice hat keep my head and ear warm without worry about the wind	positive
Excellent device. I was really skeptical but it works on my Aussie. He may bark once or twice but then the alarm goes off and he knows no more	positive
They work, but they do NOT fast charge Samsung S8	negative
Cookie mix sticks to mold. Then when cookies cook, design disappears. I bought 2 sets, received another for Christmas. I like the cookie press kit lots better. You squeeze the cookie dough through a syringe with a decorative design.	negative
My sister says it helps her knee pain! 👍	positive
This battery has not live up to my basic standards. On a full charge it will last an hour and a half and drop without warning.	negative
Love this case very functional	positive
I like this journal but I took a point because the useable paper is a bit narrower than I prefer for a sketchbook. The paper quality and the price are excellent. While I do not think this will replace my go to travel watercolor sketchbook, I would not hesitate to pick it up again in a pinch.	positive
The fitted sheets will not stay on the corners of the mattress. Each morning I have to retuck the corners. I do not have a very deep matress, the elastic is weak.	negative
My grand daughter loves it!	positive
They appear to be good quality. They work good. I haven’t tried push them to the limit, but I will order another set for the house.	positive
The frame was lopsided, returning it. =(	negative
The motion detection is great on this camera. We are capturing wildlife, including red fox and black bears. Clear pictures.	positive
Easy install, did not need to remove the bumper. Be careful with the clips on the wiring, they break easily. Great product overall!	positive
Great price and fit well for longer, thin baby.	positive
This speaker is great. Its bigger than expected...a little larger than the palm of my hand. It'll fit into my leggings pocket, but it has to be in the same pocket as my phone or it'll start to lose connection. It has a nice weight and durability to it and you can't beat the waterproof factor, but the lack of Bluetooth range is incredibly poor.	positive
I have been really enjoying this posture corrector. I have really bad posture this helps me to keep my pastor upright. It is very comfortable compared to most and is really well priced.	positive
Does not reach out as far as my stock antenna	negative
This is not an authentic Celine. I have an authentic one and is a lot different. Very disappointed. This is the first time that happened with me at amazon. will be a lot more careful next time.	negative
MADE IT WORSE!! Be careful with this product! It literally burned my skin and caused worse spots! My dark spots got darker too! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!	negative
I really really want the Biolage Matrix Smoothing Crème in the green tube but can't find it anymore :( However, this combined with a few other products works just as well maybe even better	positive
This item is Awesome! Works wonders while driving.	positive
These work better than the wax that are awful to change and keep clean. The scent seems to last longer and not over powering,	positive
The design is lovely, but I was missing a few screws and had extra screws that I did not need and could Not use to replace the missing ones.	positive
Just open the package and the “new “ HP Cartridge box was taped closed. When I open the box the cartridge was already broken into the protective covering was open. And the cartridge does not work.	negative
Zero stars... I only recieved the blue ring. The image makes it seem as if I would get all three...	negative
It arrived on time and in excellent condition.	positive
These people are crooked and they steal your money and you can't get it back	negative
Love these! I’ve already put them in several containers to use as lighting. I can’t wait to use more!	positive
Have had this on for maybe a month and the color is already chipping off.	negative
Initially, these slippers felt a bit stiff, but were still comfortable. After walking around in them for a while, the memory foam created an impression of my foot. The impression seems to make a custom fit. If you accidentally put the slippers on the wrong feet, the foot padding feels stiff and bumpy. I might purchase them again, but I prefer a memory foam that’s a little more fluffy.	positive
There is no way to replace the collar it comes on and it does not stay tight. Within 5 minutes of my dog wearing this it saga down so far it becomes completely ineffective	negative
Very nice, just as picture.	positive
I purchased this item from Amazon. It was cheaper then buying it from the original site. What a mistake! When I received it I thought something was different. This product has been tampered with! It smells like lotion, the original has no scent. I ordered directly from the company, received it today. As you can see in the picture, the one I purchased from the Amazon site has a larger hole. Whoever is supplying Amazon with the product has replaced it with regular lotion. I will be contacting Amazon by phone to let them know!!	negative
The massage is just right. Put it on a chair in the office. Relax during your lunch break.	positive
Beautiful velvet kimono! I love how the flowers are see through. A few errors with the fringe at the bottom, but easily fixed. Overall, I would recommend.	positive
Functionally it's fine, but it has a very unpleasant odor. We have aired it out for two days and the odor is still there.	negative
Best balloons we ever bought! They do not deflate at all. It’s actually been over one month and a few still hanging and fully inflated. Very beautiful as well, full set makes room super festive.	positive
It’s as cheap as anything. Falls apart as soon as you get it wet.	negative
Unfortunately my pen is leaking like crazy, total mess whenever I take it out of the case after being stored for a couple hours.	negative
Getting it installed was fairly straight forward. Someone younger and more flexible who doesn't have arthritis in their thumbs would have an easier time 😄 But once they are on, they are really nice and don't appear to wrinkle up like my previous ones had a tendency to do.	positive
A warm hearted chick flick. Coming of age, life changes, believable characters. Highly recommend!	positive
When I got this car, it was so small. Its better to get it for a 3 year old instead of an 8yr old.	negative
This was a perfect fit right down to the pre-positioned ABS cable clips. I bought a new torque wrench as well to make sure I had a calibrated torque setting.	positive
Was a little worried that my cats would not warm up to this fountain, as it was not similar to the they have been using the last 2 years, but they warmed up to it right away. I like the design and how quiet it is. Bonus is a night light.	positive
I did not get this palette and i ordered it but amazon helped me get refund which was great. I will repurchase and i hope its like the reviews	negative
Unfortunately I’ve tried several times and couldn’t get any bulb in the pack to work at all.	negative
Bought it for a gift. She loved it. Be aware that it is plastic.	positive
Product came in damaged!!! Some pieces have dark spots on them. One of the corners was smushed.	negative
Oh my god. I had no idea nori scaled up in quality like this. Working with it you immediately notice its fragrance and what this product brings to your sushi. I loved it.	positive
There was no raspberry or half and half as described. Those are the two flavors we wanted the most. very disappointing.	negative
The card stock itself is nice quality, however saying that it is “sturdy” is not quite accurate. I ordered this to create baby shower invitations, however the card stock is not thick enough. Instead, the invitations looked cheap because of how flimsy the paper was. I do not recommend the 110lb paper if you’re trying to make cards or invitations.	negative
i gave it away after one use.	negative
Sturdy construction. Warm. I love these. 4/5 stars because when the mitten is fully engaged the fingers are a bit cramped	positive
I bought it to try to establish healthy grass. In only one week my grass looks better.	positive
I like the love between the characters in each book, but each story is the same. They have an instant connection when they meet, they either try to stay away from each other or be together, there's a big issue, one almost dies or get injured, and they live happily ever after. The only difference is of course setting, main characters, and the conflict. But they're pretty much the same.	negative
Good product, could be even more useful if you make the frame taller. (:	positive
I love these! I wear them on the plane & they work perfect. They’re also really good for noise cancellation! Definitely recommend BUT I only got one pair... I really wish I could’ve gotten another one!!! Anyways, beside that, I really do enjoy them!	positive
I order 20 pic and receive 19 can u plz send me 1 coz I paid for 20	negative
This is an easy to use and easy to handle apple corer and cleanly removes the apple core from any apple	positive
This stuff did a great job of cleaning rust stains out of my sink.	positive
This moisturizer is amazing and doesn’t break me out. My only issue was with the packaging - or lack thereof. The moisturizer was basically just put in an amazon prime box, without the actual box it comes in from First Aid Beauty. Because of this, the outside was dirty. This feels really unsanitary considering the fact that this is a pump bottle w/o a protective barrier to peel off.	positive
Loved them for 3-4 months, now after winter only half are working.	negative
This product isn't half as good as my previous one. The strainer flips up every time you pour grease in it. You have to hold it down with a fork with one hand while pouring with the other hand. Don't waste your money.	negative
For me it works better than the name brand. I can see it in sunlight yet privacy still works.	positive
It was not the whole thing	negative
These essential oils arrived speedily, were packaged beautifully, and were just what I was looking for to fill my home with healing scents. All of the oils I ordered came with an instructional booklet and helpful labels. They are practically perfect!	positive
The light and magnifying glass is awsome I really like this concept. However I am very disappointed in the clamp that holds the light. This is made of plastic and the light it's self is heavy to heavy for the clamp it will not hold the light. We had to modify it with screw to hold it to a surface. If the clamp had been made of steel this would not be a problem.	negative
When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this	negative
This product took a very long time to arrive. They were hard to set up and don't work that well.	negative
This product arrived damaged in more than one area and was missing the USB charging cable. Obviously this company does not check product before sending.	negative
Love the item but one of the posts was a tad bit too thin so the earring back kept falling off. I replaced it with plastic tighter disc back but it fell off too and I lost 1 of the earrings.	negative
It is very nice looks great!	positive
Greetings Amazon. In the advertisement it says that there are 3 packages of 3 sheets for $ 9.95 And when it arrives it is only a package, I did not think it is 1. It is very expensive 1 only package for that price. If I had known, I do not buy it. Thank you I expect your response immediately. good day	negative
My 4 year old daughter and I were really excited to get these hair ties. Unfortunately they are not as pictured! They are very small!! Even for a younger child. We only received two with the polka dot material and NO striped ones. The others are Hello Kitty, Mickey Mouse and weird fluorescent florals. I was very disappointed :(	negative
Nice inexpensive shaver. Not the closest shave, but good for money,	positive
They work but the internal rechargeable battery doesn't last long enough to play a game, they also look and feel pretty cheap	negative
Found it had 3 pin hole leaks as soon as the water was turned on, thankfully Amazon is allowing me to return them	negative
My 3 year old loves it! Thank you! PS could be a little bit cheaper...	positive
Nice and bright. Replaced burned out halogens. Would order again.	positive
"We are tall and like a tall bed so we added this under our traditional 9"" box spring. It was super easy (and really cool) to 'assemble' aka unfold. Zinus products are just the best!"	positive
It actually works! Thanks from the fine hair girl	positive
Good flavor variety and came fresh in a sealed bag. Chocolate was intact even with the warm Florida heat.	positive
My boys (ages 4, 7, and 10) LOVE these books! They are really into graphic novels and they love the Warriors cats	positive
Absolutely love the color! It attracts a lot of attention & compliments. It was easy to attach. I will continue to monitor the band to see if it develops a bubble & if the leather detach from the band like the other brands. So far, I am satisfied.	positive
my granddaughters loved them with the bracelet I put in	positive
I'm 5'9 and it was longer then I expected which isn't a bad thing but I did alter it to fit the length I desired to work with my dress!! It's simple and I love it!	positive
Wanted to like the item but the posted sizing is off. My hiking partner measured well within the M size but was too tight around the chest. Returned and ordered a L and then predictably found the neck size much too large. Disappointing.	negative
My husband and I use this charger daily and it works very well. The back slides up and down so we can view the phone in tall or long mode while it is charging.	positive
Happy with purchase. Good price and they work well	positive
If you have a dog who gets bored quickly with their toys, this is a good purchase. However like most rope toys they are not indestructible.	positive
These lights are amazing! I love the ambience but don't like the open flame option or the constant change of batteries and safe disposal of said batteries. Finally found a USB charging candle. They hold a long charge - easily up to 18 hours - and charge FAST. They are bright and flickering. I love the magnetic option but honestly haven't used it yet. Definitely worth the purchase. I would buy more if they had a bigger size option.	positive
Very cheap quality. Not what I was expecting.	negative
I failed to notice that this was a 3 foot line. You do NOT want only 3 feet for a tap. 5 feet minimum or you are going to be pouring lots of foam at normal keg carbonation pressures. Beyond that it's good quality, but just too short.	positive
I'd like to return this as it doesn't work for me. when I go into amazon to make the return there is no option	negative
"Easy to use with pen, pencil, or thin-line Sharpie. I'm using them far more than I thought I would to put at the top of music I want to play. These are great if you're using ""chord hacks"" and can't remember the shortcuts."	positive
I like the wig itself because of the fullness BUT it looks used!!	negative
It's alright, but it does move in the chair.	negative
This was a horrible little bed frame. It was about 5 inches narrower than my mattress and the mattress slide all over the place. The middle supports do nothing - they don't stand up perpendicular with any sort of use. Forth, after less than a year of light use it completely fell apart. If you're looking for a good cheap bed frame I recommend Zinus Sonnet Metal Platform Bed - It's worked out great for us.	negative
Very nice lights, easy to handle & easy to use!	positive
Was not in the best condition and Electronic code has already been used!	negative
Like the product. Needed security for my Kindle Fire	positive
Cute but very very veryy small. I used them for a sorting hat selection. The sticker was also not very sticky. Most of the guest lost theirs within an hour.	negative
I don't have a huge butt, only average I think, but these things have such a short crotch seam that they ride high and are not that comfortable. I am usually a size small, I bought the medium size hoping for more room. Not to be had, they are very tight, I would not buy them again.	negative
The only issue I have is the user interface. They did really well on everything, but when I turn off my computer first, it goes into a searching for input mode, during which I can't shut it down. So I have to climb back and unplug it. Am I missing something?	positive
Velcro is coming off already, daughter loves the fit but securing shoe is now a challenge.	negative
Way short for a medium..I recommend buying a size up	negative
I used these to create a charging station for student phones. I love that they have multiple ports but I hate that they are bulky (although there is no way around it). I was only able to get 3-4 on a standard surge protector, but I’m happy with the product. I have not tested their strength yet.	positive
Hair clips are back in style and these are perfect. Add them to your formal wear or use them everyday. They were surprisingly larger than I thought but still look cute. Plus you can keep them in the box they come in	positive
Element worked great and was easy to replace on my Kenmore dryer but the thermostat was not the correct replacement part.	positive
This is a really cute book and my 1.5 year old was super excited to get it for Christmas. However after having it for only 2 days it already came apart! Disappointing.	negative
These are quite solid knobs. Only reason for 1 star off is that in the margin on the face of the knob there were quite a few that had metal splatter under the final finish. Probably only the installer would notice but in this case the installer is doing the rating too.	positive
The seat cushion felt like pins and needles with no real sturdiness underneath it. It felt as if I were going to fall through the crevices every time I moved on it. Having. Mild scoliosis, this was very uncomfortable after only a few minutes. It was returned as it did not suit my needs. The size was not an issue nor was the color. It seemed like it would have been a long lasting material over time and washable too.	negative
I found this book to be trite and hard to read. I finally just gave up and moved on.	negative
I loved this book so much. I kept it alive on my Kindle so it will be handy for a reread.	positive
While they appear sturdy, the glass is actually paper thin and they break easily.	negative
I am very disappointed that I am unable to charge my iPhone or iPad. You get a message that says the item is not supported. Would have been good to know that before I bought this. I hope to return it trouble free.	negative
Well made, quality product	positive
The adhesive on the back of this is crap. I used liquid nails to keep everything in place, if I ever have to remove these I’ll know that I’ll be sorry. Lol I originally bought these when I re-did my bathroom to use as an accent wall, I was worried I wouldn’t have enough. I actually had a lot left over, enough to put down in my laundry room. The floors look great and now I feel I’ll have to paint the laundry room to make the rest look as good as the floor. Ha!	positive
When the grill brush arrived, the quality looks much beyond my expectation. The bristle looks very strong. And after I used it to clean my grill racks. It is very easy to clean all of the dirty areas. The long handles feels good. I like the storage bag which can hold the grill brush and keep somewhere I can always find it.	positive
Super strong but hell on the hands. Not comfortable at all!!!	negative
These would not stick to my console and thus would not work as intended. I have cut and used like a magnet in other areas. Still the price for what I ended up using it for, is disappointing.	negative
He product is great and functions exactly as described. I think we’ll be using them for a good long while. The company was a little weird, sending an offer for extra lids then not following through. It seemed like a scam.	positive
These are good quality pants and I can tell they are warm and definitely waterproof. My biggest concern was sizing. I ordered a large (5’6” 140lbs) and they fit just fine... I have plenty of room to wear another layer under for my trip since it’s going to be very cold. They don’t look very flattering though! But good enough for snow pants.	positive
Was way smaller than what I thought it would be. It's not very sturdy either.	negative
Spiral effectively holds in the ground but plastic piece isn’t well made and breaks when turning spiral into the ground..	negative
Nice quality materials. Barely able to move mouth as my adult hands don’t really fit in head.	positive
It tasted good, suitable for younger folks and those who don’t have weight problems. For myself, I would just nibble on one, just for treats. Tastes good! My delivery was sent to next door because they rent and the landlord didn’t put up a door number. The delivery guy somehow thought their duplex unit is an extension of mine.	positive
Used this product for a float in a parade - ended up having to buy other pink heart foil balloons beacause the pig heads were missing and the latex balloons didn’t float with helium. We got by, but I was planning to order again at Christmas but will be passing.	negative
This bra looked great when I first tried it on and seemed to fit great so I ripped the tags off and washed it. Turns out, the underwire is BRUTAL upon second wear and I am ready to trash it. Such a bummer!	negative
Greatly recommend to buy! Love them 😍	positive
"It is smaller than I expected, despite reading the description. Bought for cats, who insist of having a blanket over it; defeating the purpose for me. It does get quite warm and needs to be monitored. ""Someone"" in the house knocked a pillow onto it and it didnt get shut off, it altered the color of the pillow and could have potentially caused a fire. That isn't anyone's fault but ours, just something to know. The blanket that came with it is laughably small and perfect for a kids toy."	positive
I ordered lemon-lime tootsie pops, the package label also said so but I received lemon tootsie pops instead!	negative
They were perfect and sturdy. Some people at first thought that they were metal.	positive
I gave this nice suit 5 stars but now have found that the bright color fades dramatically in the sun & pool	negative
exactly what I was looking for, Thank you!	positive
It would not stay attached to the tv, the next day, it was hanging off of the tv. I had to use take to hold it which is not what I was expected.	negative
Just as they were pictured.	positive
They arrived all melted together	negative
The brush works to style my hair. It works great. I like the way my hair looks, but I find it leaves my hair with some frizz. Maybe is because I need to add some product to my hair before styling and not the brush.	positive
Phone fell on the ground and not only did this glass cover shatter so did the phone screen. Not protective at all. Fell from pocket height.	negative
This is such a great decanter set. I cannot believe how nice it is for how reasonably priced it was. Definitely worth the money.	positive
This product is USED!!! I am returning! Pieces and manuals missing!!!	negative
I love the color I got...it's more of a teal than green and really gorgeous. The only thing I wish was different is...could you make the plastic window clear so you can see through it...I like to put my driver's license in these slots. Enough credit card slots for me and I like the size.	positive
I love this kind of container, but these are made with cheap zippers with tiny pulls that dont want to behave when zipping around the corners. I've learned to really hate these bags.	negative
Did not work for my item that did not come with a recharging cord 😟	negative
Color is darker than I expected but the coverage is great . I mix with a light foundation	positive
Orange not bronze. Two glass panels broken and you have to assemble. No screws. On/off press button is not discernable from off to on- but its a good size. This is not a $100 light, but you knew that.	negative
Terrible... I painted my nails and my friends and the next day they were all bubbles and started peeling day 2. I am returning	negative
The product is good however the company sent me two right wrist wraps. Which makes it very difficult to put on. My friend had ordered this product and didn't have any problems. I am unhappy with this.	negative
they didn't deliver bow when they said they would. still waiting on it. 4 days past the date they told me.	negative
It came with a defect! How can I return it?	negative
The usb cable that came with the unit did not work. Also, the light is always on and very annoying. I don’t think it’s well designed overall. Extra star because it works.	negative
If you want to recover fast from you workout Cellucor Alpha Aminos Will do that, you can't go wrong with this product, great tasting and fast recovery.	positive
Smaller than anticipated although my daughter still loves it!!	positive
omg is what you will say when you see this ,it very filling.I didn't think i could take this but with lube it went in,had to start slowly and enter only a inch at a time but after a few min wow.Would highly recommend. for beginners though.	positive
The item had some kind of dried up liquid on the carrying case. I could not allow my daughter to touch it. The stand itself was scratched in several places. I think the unknown dried up white spot is a deal breaker for me	negative
The headline said it all.	positive
Did not help and actually did the opposite. Maybe a defect in manufacturing?	negative
Good clips. Works well	positive
There is a dent in the box. None of the things inside are sealed and there are particles of dust on most of the disks. I find this strange seeing as how it was marketed as a NEW product. It seems however to be used.	negative
I bought the black vers. and I love it! Mine has loads of space, it's very soft, and it's much higher quality than originally anticipated. The lining seems sturdy, and I have no complaints thus far! Definitely worth buying!	positive
Needed an inexpensive replacement for a broken model. This fit the bill. Works as it should.	positive
The product was as described and arrived in the time noted. Thank you.	positive
Keyboard is pretty quiet. The windows key stopped responding after less than a month. I use that key a lot so that's a huge bummer.	negative
"Purchased this for a ""shared"" car, but the connectivity is sporadic. Sometimes works fine, others no audio (I can hear but connection cannot hear me. Would not purchase again."	negative
unstable and keeps on collapsing	negative
I haven't noticed much of a difference using the vitamin C on my face. I've been using it about a month.	positive
Plugging in a USB is a little stiff but good product otherwise	positive
These are great and very comfy... However I have them away I love leggings without the actual waist band. Not sure if that makes sense... But these have a waist band in that just squeezes my fat a little and makes me uncomfortable. Otherwise I would reorder these.	positive
"I love everything about this cell phone holder but it arrived with a almost 2"" indented scratch right across the front of it. I would normally return it but need the protection of my phone for a trip I'm leaving on, so I don't have time to deal with a return. Very disappointed at the lack of quality control of the product before they ship it out."	negative
Works for about 2-3 min before reporting error on iPhone.	negative
I don't know what's wrong with mine, but on more than one occasion the screws get so loose that I can't unclip. Even had a local bike shop check my set up and they couldn't figure out what was going on, even after loosening pedals. We figure these are just cheap options	negative
Gasket didn't fit properly	negative
Simply can't live without it! It makes life fun!	positive
This diffuser is perfect. Very easy to use. it can automatically change light. or it can fix light color. or no light. It’s great. My favorite is that it is made of glass. the effect is very good. it will run for a few hours. I really like it.	positive
not easy to apply. Not easy to peel off. Not good adhesive with very low weight capacity	negative
2 of the 3 pack stopped working with in a month!	negative
For the price of $20, buy them! They're not the softest, but are very nice. The pillowcases are nice and crisp, which I love. I'll buy again.	positive
Absolutely nothing changed. While my little girl doesnt have a strong smell,I thought I would try something to decrease her animal scent a little. Honest doesnt smell any different.	negative
Cute little candy dispenser , wanted it for cashews but use with m&m too. Works fine sometimes candy gets stuck. Had almost a year still doing it's job	positive
I got this Neato D7 about 2 months ago, I hate it. I wish i can take my money back. 1- Always get stuck so i have to pick up and put back to the base. 2- Don't clean well under the table. 3- The battery is having some issue so i have to wait until Neato send me another replacement.	negative
When he is on hes good, just isn't on much in this show. This just turned into a derp fest political rant. Not only the Trump rants(which were not comedy bits) but just generally a lot of ignorant SJW agenda pushing BS mixed in to a majority of the bits, really detracted from the show.	negative
This stuff does exactly what it says it does.. Removes tough bathtub scum and grime	positive
An exciting read that kept my attention.	positive
Product worked as it should but had a terrible strong dead fish odor to it. It was extremely noticeable and you could smell it from several feet away, took about 2 days of wearing it for the smell to go away. I have bought this same product in stores and it’s never had any kind of smell like this. Would not buy again from this seller again due to the strong dead fish smell.	negative
OK aftermarket mirror.	positive
Nice pin but anti-rotation pin is too short. It leaves a gap between the pin and the clutch letting the pin flop around on a shirt or blouse. I'll buy some of those rubber clutches and see if they'll fix the problem.	positive
"I've used three of these twelve jars so far and have no issues with them at all. They came packed in an original product box with nice cardboard cushioning dividers between each. One caveat: they were slightly over the use by date. I make sushi often and I use about a jar a month on average so the use by date was no problem for me. It's a years supply at that rate. I didn't detect any ""off"" flavors."	positive
I’m not a huge fan of this genre, but when I started reading this, I literally couldn’t stop! The way it is written makes you feel very connected with the characters and will leave you wanting a sequel. The author creates a satisfying sense throughout the book that keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen. I was surprised that I loved it as much as I did and I would love a sequel and also to see this book turned into a film.	positive
To short. The phone looks ugly.	negative
Had it in my pocket most of the time, didnt use it too much at all and it just fell apart	negative
In my household you can’t go wrong with a Melissa and Doug puzzle. The reason for 4 starts is the illustration of the rino and hippo. They just seem a little wacky. I’ve seen another version with similar animals, by M & D and the animals seem clearer. It’s still a great puzzle though.	positive
Absolutely LOVE it! Three levels of light, adjusts with a wave, inexpensive !	positive
Overall, this camera does really well for basic use! It will likely be much higher quality than a built in laptop camera and is more maneuverable. A couple things to note is that it has trouble focusing on things close to it, so if you need to take pictures of your school idea for online school, it will be a little blurry. Also, the edges have a little bit of a fish-eye effect, but that doesn't bother me at all!	positive
Love this diaper bag. Just the right size to fit all of the essentials without feeling like I’m carrying a huge backpack and over filling with things I don’t need. I carry diapers for 2 littles, wipes, a nursing cover, wallet, phone, sunglasses, and an extra baby outfit easily without over stuffing.	positive
Love these cubes. Wish they had lids tho.	positive
Very affective for Use and relief of nighttime foot and leg cramps.	positive
Soft fabric Great colors Playful and comfortable	positive
Great quality, just felt really big.	positive
I was so dissappointed with my shoes just discovered today that it’s already worn out. It’s only 4 months.	negative
this does not fit the tablet properly. the hard plastic part doesn't keep closed and the silicon layer needs constant fixing I unfortunately purchased two so I really lost out. very disappointed	negative
This book is for animal lovers, young adult and up. You’ll fall in love with the characters. Bittersweet story. Quick, easy read.	positive
After a few weeks use, one of the key holders disconnected from the case. I almost lost my house key. I have bought so many key holders and key chains. I was so disgusted I made a key chain from an old Christmas tree ornament. Free, too!	negative
Game has been opened. Yuck. Someone used this game. Then they taped it shut. Amazon sent it to me as a new game!!! NOT GOOD? IN FACT, TERRIBLE.	negative
A month old toothbrush has more scrubbing power than these brushes... be prepared to get 60 seconds maybe two minutes of scrubbing tops. It’s not the value that’s frustrating. It’s having to use 4-5 brushes for 1 brush job.	negative
good price, good product	positive
I use this to connect my laptop, external hard drive and Samsung S8. Very smoothe. Doesn't over heat even bring left in for days.	positive
I had one go out about 9 months after purchase. It was replaced by seller (after some run around). Now the second light has gone out. This one is in my vivarium running about 12 hours a day at 80 deg F and 70% humidity. Maybe it can't handle the conditions. Maybe I need to change to T5 tubes instead of these light. When they work they are bright and the plants were doing well under the light.	positive
Never came. Never heard from seller again.	negative
No hardware included. Should have read the reviews before I ordered. Frame wasn't even in it's packaging when i received it, just bouncing around in the shipping box with no hardware. Lesson learned.	negative
Worked just as advertised.	positive
My sim card did not fit in this	negative
Tracking reported here but no sign of it nor on my RING 2 camera.	negative
might be nice but you probably will never know because they will never arrive	negative
For years, I've wished that DeOxit had a built-in straw - my wish has come true! This makes this product flawless. Use it on anything electrical that's being disagreeable - bad switches, corroded wiring points, scratchy volume pots. You name it!	positive
Nice for the price, a little smaller than it looks in the pic	positive
It’s a lot slower than I anticipated, no way does it go over 7 mph. My son is 10 and weighs 55 lbs. His neighbor’s scooter goes faster than this. The only plus is that it does last about 30 mins riding it.	negative
Not as good as Defense Soap. I like the regular soap, but this is hot garbage.	negative
The bag looks nice, but the hanger strap broke as soon as I tried to hang it up. There wasn’t even a dress in the bag.	positive
I’ve bought several of this KB Ethos hat because the quality was good and the shipping was excellent. Then I got my hat in the mail and it was shipped in a plastic bag. Not only was it in a bag that doesn’t protect it from getting crushed, it was put in a bag that was too small so it got folded. What’s so hard about quality shipping? I took the time to spend my money with your company, the least you could do is make sure it gets to me in good shape.	negative
Not the best at eyeliner, but I like something that LASTS ALL DAY. Luckily, THIS DOES. I have hooded eyes that build up oils, and my makeup never stays. With this eyeliner, I am able to keep wearing it all day (wings included), with little to no touch up! Just need to find a good soap to remove it.	positive
Wanted to like this item, but they didn't work for us. Glad we brought regular bug spray as back up or we would have been miserable.	negative
Reasonable product but it takes a lot of rinsing to remove it. Theres no scent to speak of, which is good	negative
It's fine for homeowners work, its useful for any project around your house	positive
Super bummed. My daughter tried on the costume and there was a run in the belt and the stitching is coming apart. If it wasn’t falling apart before she even got to wear it I would have thought it was super cute. Unfortunately she has a party tomorrow and I don’t have time to return it and get a replacement.	negative
I couldn't use it for the taste was so bad . I gave it away.	negative
Great product and quality! I keep it next to my yoga mat or it can be use for many different activities. Love it. Definitely recommended.	positive
The whole where the tail goes is too small for the dog to pup. The pup gets stuck	negative
There is almost no flavor in there, it's very mild. But it does feel like you're drinking sand. There's usually an extra energy boost I get from these products that this product simply did not have, but I could still tell I felt a little better. It's not all bad, but I'm not going to buy it again.	negative
As we use community laundry room sometimes when I forget my laundry, tenants take it out, and just the fact that someone touches my stuff made me buy this bags. I only use two smallest ones, other one are huge and so far I got no use for them. After about two washes as it keeps small clothe items in, it lost the shape and got “fuzzy”	positive
The bowls are beautiful, but I was expecting something with a little more thickness. They are delicate. I am hoping they will last.	positive
I ordered this on July 17 and still have not received it. I have contacted the seller for replacement/refund. The summer is now over but I still need it.	negative
Great product. Bought this for my 8 year old grandson and he loves it. The product was exactly as pictured and described. My Grandson loved it !	positive
This is so cheaply made!! I was really really disappointed. I do use it but I like the one from the dollar store better.	negative
Kickstand broke from normal use after a couple weeks	negative
Ordered December 19 it is now February 10th and theirs no longer works won't charge remotes at all	negative
I bought these for both my wife and daughter's skis. They work great on both!	positive
Love that I can pull my hair through. Super cute and comfy!	positive
Maple syrup is wonderful if Amazon had packaged like they should have. Lid was cracked so unusable. I'll have to pour it in a jar. There was no packaging materials to protect the small items. Others have crushed boxes. Who packaged this order Amazon?	positive
Do not waste your time, the app is a disaster, I never was able to pair the switch I just waste time to connect and disconnect to return it.	negative
Very soft, but didn’t last very long without pilling. Granted, it’s probably from drying them with heat, but they take hours to dry without.	negative
This skort comes from China and it’s way to small. Knowing this I ordered a XXL, wearing a xl normally. It has no pockets as described and is a lousy material for the price. I do not recommend this item.	negative
I've only had this chair a few days. The chair is easy to set up and take down. It folds to a compact size so I can stick it in a corner of my room without taking up much space. It is very comfortable.	positive
The belt clip DOES not fit the case.	negative
Not cheaply made. Keep it in yer pocket for when you have to tame that mane!	positive
SO WORTH IT!! no shedding, natural, just the right amount of pieces. I use my homemade oil to give it a little moisture. Hair remains sooo soft . Highly recommend ‼️	positive
You get what you paid for and if you order US Flag lapels made in China, you risk quality...these are closer to ORANGE white and blue	negative
Got it for my kids toys and while I was assembling I broke one of the pieces of plastic side. & the poles were easy to bend out of shape. Maybe ok for light weight stuff and things you hardly touch.	negative
A little slow and confusing initially - a lot of names, relationships, and time periods to keep straight; but interesting concept and engaging further into the story	positive
Received a defective pair. No sound at all out of right ear.	negative
Was hoping for something a little more adjustable. Great product if it’s going to stay in a fixed location. Kinda hard to see out the back window so I loosen the straps when the pup’s not in the hatch. The straps are obnoxiously long which may be needed with some car attachments/configurations. Not sure exactly how long, but feels like 6ft when all I needed was 6in.	positive
I'm a size 6 and these were to small.	negative
Works well to keep you motivated to drink while at work. My only complaint is that it sweats a lot.	positive
Item arrived quickly in good shape.	positive
This is my first return of a product. It didn’t charge after 7 hours plugged in to a working outlet. The red light was on during charging but when the light finally turned off, the on button was pressed (a silicone-like push button). Could hear it click on but didn’t turn on at all! So putting it back in the very nice box with the handle and returning it. Disappointed but, hey, it happens!	negative
I liked the easy to use Affresh tablets. Just drop them in. Cleaned washer well. Has a fresh smell.	positive
They dont seen to fit right	negative
So far I've used the lavender in my bedroom (I spray it on my sheets before I go to bed) and the orange one in the kitchen to try and freshen the air. The scents are nice - for being on the mild side they do last longer than I thought they would. I don't know if they would work as an odor eliminator but I do like them a lot.	positive
The case feel nice and look nice but I hope it will last long	positive
It's very delicious but had a rather runny consistency compared to a calorie packed caramel dip. That's the sacrifice for calorie-free though, so can't complain too much!!	positive
It never fit properly but it stated it was the correct size. It would fit but it would easily come off the laptop.	negative
Gum is good, little small so usually have two pieces	positive
They were a little thin, but looked good on the table for the 4th of July	positive
Easy to read overview of how to sell your art with good readily implemented advice. I recommend it. Take action on its advice or its a waste of your time.	positive
The short book to educate the readers on opening a new business and operating it. It is written in a casual way rather than guided way, wherein all facts, challenges, viewpoints are expressed via conversations. The advice, motivation and facts are presented in a discussion form that I think is a different and effective way of educating. On one hand its motives and encourages to pursue the dreams, but on the flip side also warns about challenges, risks and concerns. Good book!	positive
not bad, for the price, you cant beat it	positive
I loved the top. It fit nice, and can be worn many different ways. But I needed a white top for an event, and the one that was sent was cream so I ended up sending it back. Will probably buy in black or another color.	positive
Never received the item or a refund	negative
"Product looks and feels well made, installation easy, pump 2 to 3 times and the engine is ready to fire,,, works perfect( no leaks from housing)....But if you need the hoses and tees. Don't buy this seperately,,you need to buy the hole kit, with hose and tees. Find the kits that offer all brass ""T"" fittings instead of plastic.. Especially that cheap off shore garbage. Do you want to take any chances on your machine with so called plastic fuel fittings!!!!"	positive
Like the product but they do not work with timers. I put them behind cabinets and dressers throughout my house for ambiance but when I hooked them up to a timer, they just don't work. I still have one the box unopened and probably will never use.	negative
Pictures are beautiful! Fun to do! Only reason I’m only giving 4 stars is because on the large picture the black diamonds were so stuck together I had to really play with them to get them apart.	positive
Wasn’t what I expected	negative
The decanter I received is not what is advertised. I received a cheap knock off made from thin glass weighing in at only 8oz compared to the 2lb. Decanter advertised, as well as a smooth bottom instead of a crimped to protect the bottom.	negative
Great book. Internet dating.....hmmmmm. Page turner for sure. Really like this author AND love that it isn’t a 5-7 books series!!!	positive
Product makes you feel sticky and was described as very cooling, can barely feel the peppermint	negative
At first loved the softness of these sheets. But after washing alone 4 times material is balling up where I sleep! Not worth the high cost! Wow! Seller sent a free replacement set saying that the product was not up to their expectations. I was not expecting this and was pleasantly suprised! Hope the new set lasts!	negative
Super cute but runs small. Size up and you’ll be fine.	positive
Got my box but they are almost expired.... just a month left.	negative
Learning curve to apply	positive
Purchased the Westinghouse TV on OfferUp, but the seller lost the remote. I was able to negotiate the price down for the TV, and used the money for the remote. Win-win situation..	positive
Wrong size sent. Can't install. Haven't yet begun the process of returning this product. For the cost it's not worth my time but I'll feel ripped-off if I don't return. Tossed the packaging already. Extreme hassle to me.	negative
Great tool works very well but just a little heavy	positive
it's one of the best party games around.	positive
Really like the convenience. Wish it could be stacked with the larger one on top. Second purchase - the slot holding one of the castors broke on our first set . . . but liked it enough to give it another chance.	positive
Product was delivered brand new and factory sealed. The radio reception was horrible and the CD player did not work. Returned immediately.	negative
The material is very durable rubber the tradeoff is that these are a little bit hard on my heel but I can definitely feel the difference it makes while for the plantar fascia. You may want to add some cushioning to it though	positive
Box came banged up. Whatever cut off the box, filter NOT SECURED in box (flopping side to side) scraping on the bottom, NOT TO MENTION, MANUFACTURER DATE WAS OVER A YEAR AND 1/2 OLD.....	negative
Very pleased with the screen protectors. Fits perfectly and has good directions and everything needed.	positive
There's no bad to this book. It takes you through the early unorganized times to the ultimate victory in the Pacific theater. And it does it in a very personable and interesting way.	positive
Great got what was ordered	positive
First drop and it shattered. Had it on only 24 hours. A real shame because I was enjoying it until it broke.	negative
Book looks used not new Cover and back cover are creased and worn Binding is worn also	negative
Helped a little. Nothing to write home about.	negative
I received this item absolutely trashed. It was not placed in a shipping box. Metal frame was badly bent and damaged. In addition some of the plastic vertical blinds were damaged. Very disappointed. I bought two other vertical blinds just like this one and they came in a shipping box and we're not damaged. I don't know if it was an issue with the shipping company used such as USPS because the other two didn't have a problem and were shipped by other sources.	negative
Works well enough and compact design makes it very useful	positive
Gets hot, stays warm for hours. Only complaint is when against bare skin (i.e. the back of your hand if you stick these in your gloves) it was too unbearably hot, so keep a layer in between. Great in your shoes!	positive
It does not rotate as intended. Fail!	negative
"While the plot for Second Life intrigued me, I found that it became predictable as to who the ""villain"" would be and how they fit into the story. I did finish the book, something I do not always do when that happens!"	positive
My 10 year old daughter loves her tsum tsum pink lounger. It is really cute and comfortable. Filling it with air involves a learning curve, but we worked it out. All in all, a great purchase!	positive
Granite is shiny after it is put on, but takes so much work not to leave streaks. The person who cleaned and resealed my granite recommended this. I will never buy it again as it takes so much work to get out the streaks and I did follow the instructions.	negative
The taste was very bland. I did not taste white chocolate and barely the coconut. The main thing I could not stomach was the floaters in it. And yes I did shake very well but they would still be there. I can’t purchase again. I was interested in the other flavor but I don’t want to spend that kind of money and be this disappointed. I can’t even finish the 12 pack I bought.	negative
Came in different color, wasn’t soft at all, and I doubt that it was 2,5 tog. So disappointed!	negative
Decent external case. It's as simple as it can be. It basically has a slide off cover, you put your SSD in the slot and that's it. Nothing fancy. All plastic housing. It seems pretty cheap, but it works.	positive
Did not receive product.	negative
Poor quality. Both ear buds will not pair or if they do one of them always disconnects. Very annoying.	negative
not exactly as pictured with white Kirby Logo, mine arrived a yellow color. not sure of difference but belt worked fine	positive
I love making soups in the fall/winter time so this book is perfect. This book will help you have a sumptuous Soup dishes that you can create even everyday using your very own Instant pot and pressure cooker. A definitely healthy , delicious and easy to prepare soup. If you love making soups this is the book for you!	positive
This set of gloves are yellow black colored. I live in a city of snow. I had multiple gloves but I need one which helps me survive in the coldest place. Temperature goes from 0 degree to -30 degrees and more and we really need more comfortable and more survivable gloves. These are very soft, very comfortable gloves. I loved the color combination.	positive
It came in the mail on time and was in perfect working order.	positive
I liked this heating pad so well I ordered two more -- one for my sister and one for my boss. Surprisingly, my pad stopped working last weekend (July 6, 2019), 10 months after purchase (Sept. 8, 2018). It was too expensive for such a short life.	negative
Never received my product. The delivery date keeps getting postponed.	negative
I purchased it for my desktop computer. Sound quality is good and clear. Blue light is nice. It is good for this price.	positive
Definitely a good deal for the price	positive
All the bows are falling apart. Not happy at all. I would not buy this again. I rather make my own bows . There not good at all.	negative
Got this for Valentine's Day for my Hubby. Works perfectly considering the size. He likes it very much.	positive
Bought for sisters dog and tried this out had some effect. Hopefully will work after a few times.	positive
Concealer arrived quickly.The packing is good and the quality is good.The effect of concealer is obvious and we are very satisfied	positive
These fell apart after about 1 month...of course it was after the return window had closed. I do not recommend this product.	negative
Great product but a little tough to use and please read the size because these things are huge!	positive
These are a good replacement for the price.	positive
Great value and beautiful cards. Would like more variety - ended up mostly birthday cards. Still good value for the money	positive
Never order from this place again	negative
Pros: Very large with great color. Cons: Flag material is very thin. Ordered the black one shown in the photo, received a white one. Was sent the wrong color flag.	negative
These are very handy! Each marker has the same color but one end is more of a thicker marker but as big as a regular marking pen. The other is a fine tip marker for doing more detailed work. Great for adult coloring books or anywhere you would need a fine point or a marker not as thick as the regular ones.	positive
Great for what it is. Really did come in pre-seasoned. Good weight to it. My only complaint was I didn't realize that the amazon logo was actually on the front. Doesn't take up much space but it's a bit of an eye-sore. Funny thing is getting those words grilled into a sandwich or piece of meat. I wouldn't mind it but be aware if your gifting it to someone that those letters are part of it.	positive
Good product.... Reliable.....	positive
got the report back and was very helpful	positive
Love the product I’ve been using it on my kids for years but I bought 2 of these in February to be prepared for the start of the summer and just pulled them out of the closet to see that they expired in April. And now it’s too late to return them. Why would you ship a sunscreen that expires in 2 months?	negative
Does NOT come with the storage box as pictured ...I only received 2 replacement packs of 25 thus making the cost 50% move than the other replacement packs listed on the same page.	negative
Love these hangers. They are sturdy and don’t cause bumps in your clothes at the shoulder.	positive
I’ve had better. The way the comb was and the way the wig sat on my head was terrible.	negative
LOVE the two sided magnified mirror ...lights up bright easy to charge ... not practical for carrying in a clutch or crossbody purse	positive
The candy has been exposed to too much heat. The milk chocolate is all white and dried out and crusty. It tastes stale although the good til date has 10 months to go. The product cannot be returned by Amazon policy. $40 wasted. I am throwing the candy out. Very disappointing on the part of the shipper and Amazon.	negative
Like many others, we got the ghost Pusheen. I feel like they know what's in these and sell them accordingly. The plush is cute and well made, it's just a bummer that it appears to have less of a chance of variance than if you were to buy it straight out of the case in a store.	positive
This works as described with my iPhone and iPad.	positive
Shirt is a bit short in the torso for me but I have a long midsection. Quality is good.	positive
I’m a big electronics type of person an I’m always looking for outlets to charge my electronics. What I like most about it is it’s high charging capacity and how it can take care of my electronics. It can charge two at a time. It does weigh more than it looks but that’s how power banks are	positive
The rubber doesn't hit floor evenly. Kind of defeats the purpose. Furthermore, the brush handle doesn't fit into the dustpan handle as you would expect.	negative
Worked for my son when nothing else did	positive
"The clock says ""silent non-ticking"" but ticks very loudly. Much louder than my old clock. I am a therapist and put this clock in my office and clients noticed it right away. Very distracting. Not happy with the false advertising."	negative
This infuser is awesome! I'm so pleased with it. I like the personal touch that kitchables products offers. They truly want to make sure I'm satisfied with the product.	positive
Light, looks well built, but the front foam gave me a huge headache on under an hour! Trimmed the excess foam and made it better, but I just bought a new one	negative
"Whoever was responsible for proofreading this book should be fired. Some recipes are in English measurements, some metric, some have both in the SAME recipe. Abbreviations are not standard, grams are expressed as g, gm, gn, and grams on the same page! With this little attention to detail, I'm not inclined to try any recipes because I don't know what else is wrong. The ""thousand day"" menu is just STUPID and a terrible waste of pages in the book. Who needs a 3 year meal planner?"	negative
These elastic laces are great for my son. He is 11 and not very good at tying his shoes, they always come undone. This takes the problem away. They are very low key looking, too, so no one notices.	positive
My feet feel the same 😒	negative
I received it yesterday.. It’s torn on one of the corners . If I try to take off for a picture it will tear more.	negative
Tuns out this is HUGE. Way too be and heavy for my purposes.	negative
This was smaller than I expected for the prices y’all charge and the products are smaller ...	negative
Does not come with the flasher relay product description makes it seem like it does u will need to buy a flasher relay on the side just buy the $21. And change unless u already have flashers. Other than that signals look grate. Super easy install	negative
I gave the serial number and product number for my nextbook and the cord was too large.	negative
Copper is a great pick me up color. It makes me want to use my brush . As Yin snd Yang go ...it does have a bit of rotating noise.	positive
I make a lot of key fobs and tried these out. They are actually slightly smaller than an inch so my fabric was overhanging the edge. These also scratch extremely easily when closing.	negative
Not the same horn in the picture definitely much smaller...disappointed. I have a Great Dane now I'm worried it's too small. No measurements listed.	negative
This umbrella is very practical! It is also very simple to assemble, and you can put a sun on my balcony. The base is lighter, and you must add weight to the base when the wind is strong!	positive
Just got it and can't wait to use it!	positive
My niece (11) and nephew (9) wouldn't let me stop reading this to them! I loved it myself! I can't wait until my kids are old enough to read it. Fun, rollicking adventure between a brother and sister (fit my niece and nephew perfectly). They totally could see themselves in the story (especially the sibling rivalry). If you and your children enjoy special adventure stories, you definitely want to check this out. Who wouldn't want to read about a rabbit fighting an evil giant tiger? Or a chase after a mythical unicorn?	positive
Product stop working in a few weeks	negative
Really wanted one with a standard plug to replace former one. Thos has uncommon plug and must be completely re ran to head unit	negative
As an exclusive user of this product for the last few years, (because I love the brush and how it applies) I can honestly say this product has turned to shit in the last year. I don’t know what changed, but you’d think I would get more than 5 uses out of the tube before it dries up and gets all gross. I use this product every day, so 5 uses is unacceptable. Will not be buying again.	negative
Left earbud NEVER charges. Every time I want to use them i have to push left earbud firmly into case for it to charge. Extremely frustrating for such an expensive product.	negative
I got this when I got my Vitamix 5200 to get into heathy smoothies. It does have lots of options for you. Some of the recipes seem to call for a greater number of ingredients than I want to chase down, but overall it will provide every kind of smoothie you are looking for. Solid purchase.	positive
I absolutely love the look, the solid feel of the aluminum, and everything else about it except the fact that the one I got unfortunately has something wrong with the pcb that plugs into the pi. When plugged in to the pcb the screen just turns on and off in a loop but unplug it and plug the hdmi in direct and the pi works perfectly.	negative
This is the second time I've bought this set of t-nuts and both times there were 5 or so that had bad threads. Thats an acceptable failure rate for the price.	positive
Did not fit my phone	negative
great quality. love the lettering and the design around the edges. cant wait to decorate with them. speedy delivery	positive
It smelled like blueberries. My daughter loves it.	positive
I bought these because they were fairly inexpensive but they hardly even stick and the ring is so stiff that you cannot even hardly maneuver it. After the three ring holders broke I tried the very last one I had and it lasted ONLY A DAY!!	negative
Very large in size. Bigger than I expected. Must have large drawer to put it in but very nice and well designed.	positive
Maybe it is just that I like the way the author writes; that is not too pretentious. He managed to include fairly standard fantasy elements, but then in a different way. And most of the characters are just interesting. A very entertaining and good read.	positive
My bag came with a small opening. It has spilled all over in my box. Very unhappy about that.	negative
The product was delivered on time and functioned in a limited capacity. When plugged in it would run the lap top but the battery would not charge whether the computer was on or off. The battery was at 37% and I ran the computer for many hours with the 65 watt charger connected and the battery stayed at 37%. Helped me through the crisis. I have no faults with the charger.	positive
Heart rate monitor was 40-50 point off consistently.	negative
Super gross after leaving it in my shower just for two days! It collects hair but it causes the water to rise in my tub then gets muck everywhere.	negative
My daughter's school requires a headphone. We bought one before school year started and it broke around winter break time (where the chord connects to the headphone). We purchased another one which again broke the same way after another few months. With both purchased, they didn't last the whole school year. Not recommending.	negative
Decent and gets the job done. A bit too starchy for me, but overall good.	positive
Low quality. Only lasted 1 day before it would no longer close. Small blades bent easily.	negative
Have no had blood test yet to see how well they will work.	positive
Nice product, as described, specially liked the case also.	positive
Tried to use this product instead of spending much more at the dentist for a night guard. Could not sleep with it in my mouth at night. Fits horribly even after molding it. Ended up caving and spending the money at the dentist. It is a night a day difference compared to this product. Highly recommend saving your money.	negative
The humidifier part seems to work well, but it does not glow color as described. A little disappointed because I chose it for that reason.	negative
Had a bad allergic reaction with this product Severe itching,slight nausea,bad dreams to name a few.Will not buy again.	negative
SEE MY PHOTO! This is labeled as if it is a fit for a 2016 Honda CR-Z, but I ASSURE you it's not. The actual filter for the 2016 is square and much smaller. Had to return. Other reviews state its not a fit. Seller needs to update and correct the listing.	negative
"Loved the way it looked. Went on great. HOWEVER, its intended purpose was for PRIVACY (as it is advertised). Apparently don't purchase a ""pattern"" design as in the LEMON CLOUD 3D as outsiders can still see in through the clear part of the flower design. Therefore, since it is being marketed as 'PRIVACY' window film, I would not recommend this particular pattern, but good to keep in mind if you are purchasing any type of ""design"" versus a solid color as silver or black."	negative
These are for flat butts only! I have an athletic butt so the waist band comes down too low!!!!	negative
Read the fine print. Cover only	negative
These high waisted pants are wonderful. The color is super fun and they are beyond comfortable. I am a big fan of high waisted work out pants vs regular waist line. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I would have liked a bit more compression, which is what I was expecting based on the name of the pants. However, these will be perfect for my home workouts and running errands.	positive
Looks good but weight is too heavy n hurts when any pressure is applied.	negative
Very handsome, appears to be well made, and keeps excellent time. Love it!	positive
If you can't stand the bottom sheet to be loose, you won't like these unless you have a very deep mattress. I like them and since they are cotton, I am sure they will shrink over time and fit better. Fabric is soft.	positive
I tried to watch this but my screen was just black the whole time with only sound. Waste of money. Definitely won't be renting from amazon again.	negative
Never got the package and Was denied refund or replacement	negative
Remote could be better but still worth the money	positive
Good lines good quality	positive
Not as good as everyone makes it out to be and WAY over priced. THIS IS A REAL REVIEW!!! I am not a robot or hired by the company to make ratings go up.	negative
I bought this diaper bag for my daughter. Her son is two now so she doesn't need to carry much. I wish we purchased this when he was born! It is light, plenty of room and fashionable. Even her husband doesn't mind carrying it. Great quality and loved the price. Will definably by again.	positive
Works great! Handy when making cookies!	positive
I've had this product for a month and the pepper grinder has already broke and wont grind the pepper anymore. Really disappointed with the quality of the top of the shaker.	negative
I had a smaller version that worked well. After years on the deck the connections started to fail. I ended up fixing those and installing these... Still wish for a slightly better sound but I'm picky...	positive
Lovely calendar and wonderful photographs, but Amazon apparently doesn't know how to pack and ship a calendar. The hard cardboard in the middle of the calendar doesn't extend to the edges, so the calendar gets smashed because they ship it in a soft enveloped. This happened not only to the original calendar I ordered but to its replacement!	negative
I RETURNED IT AND NEVER RECEIVED A CREDIT . WHAT A RIPOFF!	negative
Sadly I didn't receive this item. My mail carrier did NOT leave it in my mailbox as the tracking shows. I watched her deliver mail that day because I knew this was coming and worried it would be too big for the mailbox	negative
Light flickers when the wire is being touched or tapped.	negative
I have a bunch of these for all my dry goods	positive
The product lights aren’t very bright. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Cheap junk that needs to be removed from Amazon.	negative
Have waited a week for a response and have not heard back.	negative
I purchased the makeup brushes for my daughter, she said they are very nice.	positive
The first knife I ordered arrived with a huge warp in the blade, an immediate deal breaker. After an unsuccessful attempting to reach out to the manufacturer, Amazon had a replacement out to me the next day. The replacement had no issues. As other reviewers mentioned, it's not that sharp. Not a problem for me, 20 minutes later with various grit stones and a final strop, this knife is sharp!	positive
Lovely party favor...good price and the kids loved it .	positive
The print quality (black on white) is fine. But removing the backing is difficult and frustrating. Would not buy again.	negative
Not thick and plush as you'd think. Hoping a wash will fluff them up. Was hoping more like PB towels. Oh well. Keeping mostly for the design but these won't do for everyday use.	negative
works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound.	positive
They died quickly, don't hold a charge well, are not bright at	negative
I usual Macomber fashion this story has characters that you would like for friends. Their problems point to usual human need in us all.	positive
Bout this in November and it was great until the kick stand broke. The little piece that keeps it in the track broke off after a little under 2 months. Maybe mine was defective. I can't recommend this product, but if you need a kickstand, I guess give this a shot. But probably pass on it. Good protection though.	negative
Very comfortable. I like these pants very much!	positive
Does not hold air. Buy a different brand. Dont waste your money	negative
Have to change my review die to having dropped my phone discovered this case doesn't protect the face of the phone at all.	negative
The first third and last third of this volume were interesting, fast reads. I got bogged down in the middle section which discussed the intricate details of Hamilton’s influence as Treasury Secretary on the American Banking system. However, this biography still merits a solid four stars from me.	positive
Feels cheap and not comfortable	negative
The light bulb socket was broken, this light does not come with a dimmer switch, you can buy one for it,as I did on Amazon.	negative
I enjoyed the trip through history with characters I will remember. Experiencing Poland during WWII was educational and entertaining. Thanks for the read.	positive
Prevents food from getting on the floor, but not water. Looks good though.	positive
Make hair sorta oily	negative
I never received item	negative
I bought these for my boyfriend who has Hulk hands and tends to break all wine glasses. After 2 times of this in the freezer, one of our glasses broke apart and is continuously splitting every time it is put in the freezer. Even when he doesn't Hulk him, we have the worst luck with the glasses we get. Guess we should switch to beer!	negative
This was not a good toy. Didn't work right and child was upset and told me to send it back to Santa... but Amazon would not let this item be returned!	negative
Great deal for the price. I only used it for a trip where I drove so not sure how it would hold up if used for air travel.	positive
You get what you pay for and for the price it was a great buy. It was a little small for my husband but it worked for him wearing it for only a couple of hours Halloween night.	positive
Poor quality construction - would not purchase again.	negative
I didn’t receive it. I don’t know where or who they gave it to. I am very upset.	negative
I wish I had bought this years ago! This product is brilliant! Before buying this I had a similar set up but the base attached directly to the dash via sticky tape. This design is so much better! It stays firmly in the vent and doesn't ever fall out. The magnet was more than strong enough to hold my phone even when I didn't feel like slowing down over speed bumps.	positive
Banner had to be strung. For $12.99 it was not worth it. No instructions. Just a stack of square cards with letters and 2 strings. Disappointed.	negative
It was a direct replacement of the original batteries for the Razor scooter. Fit perfectly and charged right up and lasted the same amount of time as the originals.	positive
Love this to hold my credit cards	positive
Brightness can be adjusted, led lights have good eye protection.	positive
I never received the hat. I want my money back! It’s been 3 months!	negative
Without much use and simply sitting in my freezer one of the ice packs split, I would get my money back if I could.	negative
Very nice knife, even packaging is first rate, will prob purchase more.	positive
The comb is nice, but the scissors are crap. They do not function smoothly, there is too much friction while operating them. Hard to explain, but as if they are catching on something when trying to open/close them, if that makes sense. Feels like faulty manufacturing.	negative
This is junk! I make smoothies and my last one burned up with lots of use. This one wont blend frozen fruit or veggies! You get what you pay for. Will buy a better made blender.	negative
"Capri's way too short... picture shows length at calf...they hit me at the back of my knee...uncomfortable at that lengh..too bad because they are affordable. I am 5'8"" larger size would be too big.. hopefully the lengh issue can be resolved."	negative
I'd of liked the seeds but got a package but nothing in the package was empty what happened	negative
Great amount of bubbles generated and really nice smell	positive
Ordered and when it came it did not work. The contacts were not put in place correctly. My husband had to take it apart to try and fix it.	negative
I didn't end up playing the game, as it was not clear how to work it.	negative
wow! what can i say, for the price of this faucet it does the trick quite nicely. Very solid feel and adjusts nicely. I installed this in my RV and it was a breeze. No need to buy the expensive name brand when this one does just as well.	positive
I read that sizing up was necessary based on reviews--this skirt is poorly made to begin with. The fabric is not any sort of comfortable, and ultimately disappointing purchase.	negative
Not the same product as shown. Plastic twist cap with plastic thread.	negative
SHHH....Its a Christmas present for my daughter. Everything came to us in a very timely manner, was exactly as described, and in great condition. Fingers crossed she loves it!	positive
All was ok...up to the moment I found a better one at a cheaper price.	positive
Never got it :( they stole my money	negative
mine came in a flimsy box that fell apart immediately- unbeknownst to me it requires assembly and it is missing a lot of the necessary hardware to assemble it - also rather bulky. so hopefully amazon can give me my money back	negative
They didnt hold up good. They look dirty and all fuzzy after a few uses.	negative
The album came slightly damaged, but that's alright. I am missing my yellow wood card and photo though, which kind of disappointed me. EDIT: Yellow wood preorder card and photo arrived separately.	positive
I like that 4 were included and they work fine. The free case that comes with it is a bit flimsy but it was free (part of the combo) so cant really complain about that. Overall good value.	positive
not even sure what the hell I would need 3 non power delivering usb ports. I guess if i needed to upload pictures off 3 phones directly at the same time maybe? my phone connects to my pc when plugged into it, but not one ounce of power delivered to it. cant use anything that requires power via the usbs either. anything plugged in must have its own power supply and why the hell would i need that? money grab.	negative
I liked the way they showed the different raptors from multiple angles on the same page. Innovative concept.	positive
My local stores stopped carrying this product so I was forced to purchase it on line. It is way too expensive for both the product and shipping.	positive
I use this to store robotics parts on my classroom. It’s exactly what I was looking for. The drawers slide easily but you do have to be careful upon full extension as they may come disconnected. Only reason for 4 stars.	positive
Somewhat small around the waist. Otherwise perfect.	positive
Great quality kneepads. My kids use them whenever they play basketball. Comfortable and affordable. My kid are 8 years old and ordered small size for him , it fits perfectly on him , I would recommend and will continue to buy this product.	positive
It is perfect! Just as I thought it would be! Adorable in my laundry room!	negative
It's a fantastic curling iron, the only thing that I have an issue with is the tip you hold it is extremely small and burned my fingers a few times till I adapted to the size.	positive
The plate is not deep enough and the switch prevents the cover from being flush.	negative
Nice sweater! Warm and stylish! It made lint balls quickly is why I didn't give it 5 stars.	positive
Not what I hoped. May wear them come winter, but not made as well as I had hoped.	negative
Love it! Nice and moist. Took a while to get here and it was shipped from the mainland.	positive
The idea of this product is great and I thought that it will be a good temporary solution.. but its not. I purchased the small and its way to be big. its fall off and just pointless	negative
Could not recommend this play more, the intense blend of time and place creates an arch that is unmatched. The characters are endearing and by the end of the play, your heart breaks when you leave them.	positive
I loved this water bottle, and my dog also loved this water bottle, but after about a month or so of use, it has stopped working. It stopped dispensing water. I wish it worked better because I thought it was so nifty.	negative
I was using these for a project, I ordered a total of about 96 units, a hand full had too small of a hole in the back and caused product failure of the project we were involved in.	negative
Didn't notice any change.	negative
While I enjoyed this movie in my mid 50’s I would expect the typical teen To -late 20’s to rate it 5 stars. I wrongly wasn’t expecting this level of quality performance and storyline for a tube red original movie. It’s quite good if you enjoy the genre.	positive
At first I was so excited to receive this but after a month of use the center began to tear down the middle . Not worth the money	negative
I was looking forward to the real UK Cadbury, but this product came w no insulation in a regular envelope and was a bag of liquid when it arrive in CT. There is no refund or seller, so no recourse, a bad buy.	negative
Phone case is heavier than the others I have purchased. I also wish there was room for more than one card in the slot. All that being said it is a nice sturdy case and we'll worth the price I paid.	positive
This phone after one year does not allow me talk on the phone without being on speaker mode.	negative
Very cool Star Wars toy. A little difficult to figure out the commands and how to get it to do what you want.	positive
The second time I tried to open it a metal spike poked thru the umbrella. It is beautiful but seams are unraveling around the edges and I JUST got it!	negative
I never received this item and it's marked delivered?	negative
If you put them in the right place, they will stay in the vent.I was wrong, but one day I was right. I was so happy.When it came out of the vent, it didn't bother me to take it off the back of the phone, but now I've connected it correctly.Plus, my iPhone X Max has a heavy case, and magnets hold my phone perfectly.	positive
They work pretty good if you have a small car and no racks. All you need is these and 2-4 rachet straps. My only complaint is they blow away if its windy because theyre really light. Theyll move around when you try and load it but they serve their purpose.	positive
It looks nice and I am able to use my phone and all that. But it definitely does not keep me warm. Even in slightly cold weather it does not work and I feel better without the gloves.	negative
This kit broke first time I used it , bottom ring snapped , and won’t expand anymore , I haven’t e-mailed the company yet , only happened Friday January 26th 2018 I wouldn’t recommend it at all.	negative
Just a little large but they are real comfortable but they are real comparable do you suggest I get a 38	positive
Lots of brown patches after application.	negative
Don’t waste your time and money on these. All of them died btw 1-3 weeks of use.	negative
It is a good case but sometimes feels like it's hard to open the charging flap	positive
Positive experience with this vendor, everything as promised. These knives are made extremely well and are equally attractive. They fit in the hand well and I have used them on beef, pork, veal, and chicken with excellent results. They have been through the dishwasher several times and there has been no issues. I would recommend these knives to anyone who asked. I would advise handling carefully because they are extremely sharp!	positive
Costume runs ridiculously large. My son is 8 and he is swimming in the Medium. The material is very cheap for the price and nothing stays put. The hat is 5 sizes to small for him and can not be adjusted. Really disappointed.	negative
lights didn't work right out of package, wires are loose. poor design. (over priced)	negative
These noodles have almost no calories, no carbs, and are ready to eat in one minute. They give me a nice filled feeling. They don't have any flavor on their own, but like all noodles, you should put something on them. I do not notice any objectionable scent or flavor that some other reviewers have mentioned.	positive
product doesn't work. poor design	negative
I love the look and style. The sound quality would be great if you didn’t have to hold the ear pieces in the ears. It doesn’t have enough resistance to hold its place in the ears. Otherwise this would have been amazing.	negative
Doesn’t fit well on my bushmaster.	negative
Not sure how to rate this. The product really works. How do I know this? I know this because I bought a disposable travel pack to keep in my car. My breath is 100% fresher. However, the pumps on the 2 bottles are awful. Don't buy this product in this format. it isn't worth the money.	negative
It did not fit my Galaxy Note 5 Phone - perhaps I can find something it does fit or perhaps another cable that will fit the phone (Fast Charger unit is regular USB) - and it was recommended - and linked to the Amazon product - by the Samsung site as a valid replacement for the cable - They are out of stock! Pros - they sent me the item Cons - the Item does not work on my Galaxy Note 5	negative
I got this for hubbies new hobby and he loves it.	positive
Upon receiving the item all but 1 dish and cup were completely broken. Since I had ordered 2 boxes, I was able to unpack and exam the quality of this dish set. Overall the pattern and color are nice. The plates and bowls are smaller than what I had expected. Hopefully when I receive the replacement set I will better be able to enjoy these dishes.	negative
Good book, has everything to get you ready for the test. . However they will be changing soon. Best to wait for the new edition	positive
Unfortunately due to a reschedule didn’t have a need for this immediately and put it away without examining it. Now opening it and discovering due to a manufacturing defect, there is less space “inside” than there should be. Very poor Q/A.	negative
XS was a little too small. Have XS collar and fits good so recommend going a size bigger because my puppy cannot put all his legs in this costume due to the size	positive
Black Plastic Casing broke when installing but other than that it is way better than keys. May update other doors as price comes down over time.	positive
I am an admirer of Asher's books. Reading this one was a pleasure as usual.	positive
I had this charger for only one month and it already broke. the plug in part got stuck into my laptop and the actual cord detached. I hope I can get a refund or a new one sent to me.	negative
I liked the design of both the shirt and the onesie. Very cute!! Also, received the items very speedy - within 2 days with standard shipping! I really appreciated that! Will definitely order from this vendor again!	positive
It taste like blood, its really terrible	negative
A bit slow in parts especially reading the series in order but overall a good read. On to the next one in audible.	positive
As with most hearing aid batteries they're easy to carry around with you and are reliable. I was a little disappointed with the short battery life. On average, the batteries only last about a week. Typically I would expect them to last 10-14 days. It may be because I have Phonak hearing aids which take a little more energy than others to operate.	positive
The print was only on one side and the material was not velour but a cheap cotton. I was really disappointed but it was a gift and I needed it then.	negative
The bits are ok they tend to bend or strip really easy even knowing I'm using it with a 12v drill and the lowest torque and that is 1 about 1lbs	negative
Love the design but not the fold back and tuck feature. It never stays put! I bought this to replace my old Fintie case which I loved, but I didn’t read the description carefully enough, as this one doesn’t rotate or have the elastic strip to close securely - two features I loved, but that’s my fault for buying impulsively. I will use this case until I can find a good replacement...this one is mainly just pretty.	negative
Everything you need for phone repairs at a low cost	positive
Prefect fit band for my Alta. In fact, I like it better than my original band. Clipped on immediately and completely and I am thinking of ordering another one.	positive
Just another cheap stretchy bra. Nothing to write home about.	negative
Package said it was windows 7 compatible. Driver would not install correctly no matter what I tried.	negative
Doesnt last very long	negative
Having owned a coffee shop and accustomed to good espresso, this machine and the coffee is everything you can get at a good coffee shop. The little aeroccino milk frother makes perfect foam every time. This was such a great deal I highly recommend it!	positive
Very cute on, comfortable	positive
This screen protector constantly fogs up. Also, there's a black border around it that blocks just enough of the screen to make some things impossible.	negative
Bought this recently along with 150 ml one and love it! Use this one for our kitchen/dining room area and the 150 ml for our bedroom. Lasts for hours, love the changing lighting, very relaxing.	positive
Well written and full of great insight. I would suggest this to any woman/man regardless of where they are on their journey. Loved every page!	positive
Great when it works but it breaks too easily or stops working after a while.	negative
My sons phone cracked after a small drop(less then a foot on to a table) with the case on. It said its protector was drop resistant. Very disappointed requesting a refund. 1 star rating is due to Amazon policy.	negative
i'm 5ft 6inches and weigh 140 and the small was too big. i'm really trying to watch my posture because i'm a server and have issues with my back. it's a great idea, but it just didn't fit	negative
I Just got so far it alright.	positive
Does not stick to side of kitchen counter to hold small outlet for mixer it fell off multiple times or in car as iPhone hands free holder. My cellphone holder lost its sticky so I was hoping these pads would hold it in place but it didn't, kept tipping over. Very disappointed!!!	negative
These are good for the environment. So buy them. Save our planet if you don’t want to wash dishes	positive
If I could give them 0 stars I would. They sent me something that isn't even a charger. WTF is this stuff?	negative
Nice feel and look to it. Would like it to be a bit more roomier, but overall a good product.	positive
So as some other reviews mention, no matter how much of a perfectionist baker you are, these still will have a little line in the center. I’ve tried a million different methods of pouring the batter in and can’t seem to get rid of that. However if you like your cake pops tasting like actual cake and not half baked batter, or if you want to make a lot in a short period of time, this machine is perfect. Especially for the price	positive
the magnetic bit that goes into the phone is poorly designed / manufactured I lost 2 head.	negative
this order was not received	negative
As described, great price!	positive
The inside of the tube was rusted as I took it out of the box. The bottom threaded hope worked, but the top had such poor welding the bolt wouldn't go through to secure the pole. Returning	negative
Everything was just as described. Arrived as advertised and easy to install	positive
Received smashed up and was unable to use and unable to return. I do not recommend buying this from this shop.	negative
I really thought there would be some elastic around the waist, it's difficult to tie tight enough to stay up and if you pull too hard on the strings ... RIP. The fabric is comfortable and soft, I just don't think it's made very well but I do have some great window rags now!	negative
Perfect for my giant tote and keeping things organized	positive
Worked perfectly for me!	positive
Pictures are great and it's super fun	positive
Great fitting shoe. The insole is removable so I can insert my orthodics underneath and get the benefit of the cushioning of original insole. The dark gray color is very classy and the aqua trim and laces brighten it up. I will enjoy wearing these on my upcoming vacation.	positive
This was a great movie when I was a child. I watched it recently and forgot how bad the music was for this movie	positive
I noticed a difference within only a couple days, but the strong smell takes some getting used to!	positive
This product has made such a difference , my husband can now hear & enjoy the television & I don't have to listen at an insanely loud volume.	positive
It's a large size microfiber sheet. I would not call it a beach towel but it could be used to cover the lounge chair at the pool. It is absorbent, and it takes no room compared to a conventional towel so if you want to dry off with it, it'll do the job. Four stars for ambiguity.	positive
It’s a very nice item. It’s fits in with my decor. I am happy I purchased it.	positive
The sweater was put together wrong. The tag was sewn on the outside (smooth seams), the arms were sewn inside out (cuffs tacked on rough seams). In addition, before I even noticed this I tried to get wrinkles from vacuum packing out and while I was able to get some out there were still quite a few that seems like they aren't going anywhere. I thought I'd keep it for knocking around until I discovered that some seams were on inside, some on outside and sleeves tacked incorrectly.	negative
Bought this to help my Mom with a clogged bath tub drain. Worked great and saved us the cost of a plumber. This product when used will lose some teeth and after a few uses should be disposed. However, you get several in a package and they are inexpensive and do the job!	positive
Very strong I’m sure this will protect your phone from the heaviest drops.	positive
Loved the stories but the omissions of words, bad spelling and grammar were a disappointment.	positive
They were great for the value. Even better if you use a dab of spirit gum to make sure they stay on.	positive
I have pretty sensitive dry skin with eczema. This sunblock works well for my daily use! And I really the texture of the cream as well as its subtle scent.	positive
I got the jacket for my son who is going to college in Flagstaff, AZ the jacket keeps him very warm but the first time he wore it, it ripped on the seam	positive
I had to return this band because one side of the band did not fit my watch. The quality was really nice other than it not fitting. The weight was good. The color was good and it shined nicely. I would have loved to keep it. Returning was easy and my refund came fast.	negative
3 months later... blue is starting to peel off revealing a pinkish/purple color underneath	negative
This means with its help, your organization can stay ahead of the competition by providing you the correct information at the right time with minimal effort. You don't have to worry about looking for data in multiple places, or learning complex SQL statements to find out the business information. You will find it easy to deal with an increasing number of reports, dashboards and natural-language query engines which can be used by business users without any technical support.	positive
A favorite treat for my canines... bug and small.	positive
The item is thin plastic, but thus far (5 or so uses), it works fine. There is a tab that helps keep the top part in place on the bottom cup. I like that there are measurement lines on the container. It is quite small, but it works well.	positive
I'm quite pleased with this item. It also buttons together and the front and the underwear button together on both sides, definitely a good outfit for easy access LOL	positive
great item, will be perfect for camping. *****BATTERIES ARE ALREADY IN LIGHTS- BUT THEY ARE WRAPPED UP SO IT WILL NOT WORK AT FIRST UNTIL YOU REMOVE THE WRAPPER****** when I first opened them I tried to turn it on and when it didn't work I assumed they were included in the package, I emailed the shipper and was emailed back within the hour letting me know the batteries should be inside light.	positive
Perfect fit according to chart. Only socks you will need in the frigid temps when you are working out in it	positive
Good quality non stick ceramic coated pan. Very easy to clean and is great value for the price.	positive
I think they have been sitting on the shelf. The contents in the capsule look dried up.	negative
Good product but the hood is definitely made for someone with an abnormally large head.	positive
This book was a disappointment! I typically can read straight thru in one setting. I struggled to keep focus. I was confused by the storyline. It felt thrown together and lacked passion. Ghost writer?? This is not the same author that i have enjoyed for years! Not worth it. Wait until it is a free read. I want my money back. Good reading is a result of excellent writing...this was not a good read!	negative
Nice looking pots, although there are slight blemishes in the design. But for the price not a big deal. Would buy again.	positive
I am not happy with the smell of this Lemongrass Oil. It has a sour, spoiled aroma. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. The packaging and bottle are both fine, it's the oil itself which is a bit rancid smelling. Sadly, I tossed the packaging so cannot return it.	negative
Came with these weird marks along seam. Not very soft. It says super soft, but it feels like the cheap sheets from Walmart. Got 2 stars instead of 1 because the zipper is very smooth.	negative
Arrived in time. Product works perfectly. Very happy with purchase.	positive
My package arrived when it said it was going to, but it was like I bought it straight off the shelf. I figured it would show up discrete, in a brown box like it usually does. Instead it was in its original box, picture and description for the world to see. What was supposed to be a gift is no longer one since my partner could very CLEARLY see what was in the box.	negative
Normally I wear a 6.5 but not in this brand so I ordered a size 7 I love these boots so I hope they work!	positive
Happy with what I got	positive
Makes riding in the car & any place I sit the lumbar pillow gives me a lot of support & makes me as comfortable as possible. I have a lot of osteoarthritis, therefore can only get a little relief.	positive
Very nice case. Find myself using the kickstand feature more than I thought I would. Very cool!	positive
They look great but you can't get them onto the cable. I managed to get 2 on with a lot of work. Will most likely return.	negative
Looks cool and I really love it! Very comfortable and sturdy leash. Well made.	positive
These are cute! Baby loved them but there is no way to wash them. Water gets in which is a huge no-no.	negative
The ring is very pretty. However, the rose gold-tone began fading within a week of my daughter wearing it.	negative
Broke after 3 months, not happy!	negative
This model do not have a GPS connection, also the time on the watch delayed 10 minutes. The menu Is not easy or simple to operate.	negative
Great Customer Service! Thank you...	positive
It does not have enough fibers to actually sweep. They're also very stiff.	negative
This item gets dirty way to fast and it does not fit the car properly.	negative
Good price, good basic set, wish it had more smaller sizes of drill bits.	positive
I absolutely love these lights they are brighter than my installed lighting on my home and I don't have to use electricity everything is solar powered they are so bright I just love them	positive
It charges fine, but the blue light stays on while the phone is charging. I bought this to put it by my bed, but since the light stays on, you can’t really sleep with it charging. I don’t really use it at all.	negative
Fits the phone perfect and looks great!	positive
It is easy to get the ice cubes out.	positive
Great size, and fits on the first shelf in our fridge. My only complaints are 1) the lid leaks if I shake it or tip it sideways and 2) the nozzle is plastic, as most are - but it feels cheap and may break. The jar is such a great size and quality though, that I plan on purchasing a stainless steel spout for it.	positive
Handy for tough plaque!	positive
Edit: the company sent me a new one that also came with a quick charge wall adapter. This charges much faster and all the way when using the wall adapter Waste of money. Had my phone on it all night and it only managed to charge up to 73 percent	positive
Works exactly as I intended. I wanted it to hang flower boxes on my chainlink fence.	positive
This case is nice and sleek. It's on the thin side and I wish it had a little holder for a keyring. Also a dust magnet like all silicone cases but all in all, nice.	positive
Do not buy this!!! First off the box says rust resistant. I recieved this green (not black as described) rusted old mailbox with numbers still on the broken lid. WTF Amazon?? Did your driver steal this off someone's house and deliver to me!!	negative
The blanket does keep you cool and it really does help you to get a good nights rest.	positive
I have had other hand-held vacs and none were like one. The flip down suction cleaner does not stay down and the vacuum does not pick up well at all.	negative
Very small sitting between arm rest. Cheap plastic	negative
So far it is one of the better cooking games I have played	positive
This band did not fit my Apple 4 watch fits huge	negative
Somehow, while I enjoyed the theatrical release, the extended version did not add much value and made the experience rather tedious, I'm afraid.	negative
Product works well and throws the snow a good distance. However upon my third use of the product there is one tiny screw that holds the handle on. This screw fell out and because the handle is adjustable and the screw only has about 3 threads to hold the screw in when the screw came out it stripped the threads making it impossible to get a new screw in to hold the handle on the machine.	negative
I bought this for my Honda Ridgeline so my wife could step up to access the bed. It looks nice and seems to be good quality. However, it does not come with a pin which required an additional trip to the store. They should be clear that the hitch does not come with a required pin.	positive
Break easily. Hole needs to be exact to install properly.	negative
Super soft but the chest area doesn't fit so I may or may not return or just use a sweater	positive
Too big in the waist and too long	negative
Didn't have wheels and was hard to move on the floor. Didn't seem to heat as well as others I have. Returned it	negative
I did not place any order at all. This is a mistake. I've never even shopped for this beverage. I need to return it. It is unopened.	negative
Works great. Removes hair painlessly. Lightweight. Highly recommend!	positive
This product works seamlessly! I have struggled with loss of connections, wi-fi extenders, slow gaming, etc.. but this has solved all our connectivity woes.	positive
Broke out of box would not recommend	negative
Bubbles were very simple to mix and use. Kids had a blast with it! Will definitely reorder. Highly recommended!	positive
The product shows up in my control panel but Guardian Protection wont allow me to add it in.	positive
It’s was fast shipping looks good	positive
It arrived dirty and one in the pack instead of 2.	negative
My daughter purchased these, but ended up returning them. She said that the quality was not as good as another brand she previously purchased.	negative
Good Product. Dissolves quickly as described. The taste isnt the most spectacular for any of the flavors, but is far more feasible to carry around with you than an equivalent amount of gatorade. I am a runner that puts in a lot of miles in a given week, so these are very convenient to keep in my desk drawer or in my bag. I would recommend these to others and would order again.	positive
Lots of waste due to wrinkles! I love the finished product, but wasted half because of wrinkles!	negative
This isn’t meant to be shipped in a bubble envelope; as a result of poor shipping methods the metal was bent out of shape (it was dropped at my door. I’d hate to know what the postal service would have done if they had to put it in our small mail box!). The metal isn’t very strong so which some work I was able to bring it to a semi presentable condition and make the wax tray fit the metal light bulb area. Wouldn’t but from these people again.	negative
When I got it, it was broken 😔 I was really excited to use it.	negative
Cute idea, but maybe take better care of how u ship the package. This was suppose to be a gift. Nobody wants a damaged item	negative
This cord doesn’t even work! I know it’s not the box because it doesn’t work I. My car or portable charger either. Frustrated but too much trouble to mess with returning it	negative
Looked cheap, flimsy, and overall just not good quality.	negative
Less than 5 minutes after installation of the axle it broke. Not sure if there was a defect or what. I would recommend buying extra axle shafts with this perchase!	negative
Unfortunately, it arrived damaged. It was to be used on a camping trip this weekend. Now I have to drive over an hour one way to a UPS store to return it. Hopefully when the replacement arrives I can provide a good review. So disappointed.	negative
This book had me hooked from the beginning. Can't wait to read them all. Fantasy with biblical prophecy in motion.	positive
Frankly these dividers need to be like, half the size and taller; they're great for dividing cutting boards, but they're too flimsy to hold the entire weight of a pan, too big to hold most small lids, and the weird dip in the middle only accomodates lids with knobs (as opposed to handles). Not really what I was looking for, I'm just going to build something with wood panels and dowels instead.	negative
This dress is super cute and sexy especially for the price. My husband fell in love with the dress when I tried it on...cant wait to get dolled up for our birthday next month. This dress will be a hit...oh and I am thinking of ordering a black one.	positive
This is a beautiful blanket and it's very soft BUT it's very thin material. I was really hoping that it was going to be a thicker material. It'll be perfect for summer to keep the chill off when the air conditioning is on but I'm going to have to get something else for winter this year.	positive
It does not stretch much, So it keeps everything nice and tight.	positive
Lasted 9 weeks before the belt clip fell off which is how I prefer to attach it. Otherwise was great while it lasted.	negative
2 1/2 stars. Spray patterns work fine. Does not shut off water completely when handle is released, so it dribbles until you turn the source water off. Seems flimsy.	negative
Works for my glasses even though they are a bit bigger than I would have preferred if I could have chosen the size.	positive
This screen stopped working immediately -the parts that came preassembled didn't work at all!	negative
This is a total rip off do not waste your money it is overpriced	negative
So weird! The bags are good but they are packed in an unmarked cardboard box & are folded together. There’s no easy way to dispense them. I can’t pull out just one bag. When I pull one out they all come out. And because they’re in a plain box with 4 flaps instead of a dispenser box they’re inconvenient. I won’t buy these again. For me the cost savings isn’t worth the hassle	negative
Knife does not have any real cutting capability- serration in blade tears if at all and certainly in no way cuts. Overall average quality regarding general product.	negative
I’m really happy with the 2 piece cover finely something to protect the leather sofa thanks.	positive
Quality isn’t as expected. Cheap plastic feeling. Looks just like the picture but quality isn’t there.	negative
My toddlers plays in here every day. It has maintained very well with daily use. Easy set up and break down.	positive
One headlight is flickering after a few months of use. Use another brand.	negative
Really good dumbbell set 5 to 35 increments of 5	positive
There are never enough chargers around when you need one. The charger works, it has two USB ports, and it’s cheaper than the OEM version. I don’t know about longevity, but it is hard plastic, so I’m expecting reasonable durability.	positive
They work tremendously well I haven't seen any little creatures	positive
I liked this unique tshirt and bought it for our trip to Universal. I had to order it in a Large because it was the only size I could get with Prime shipping. I normally wear a small so I was worried I'd swim in it but it turned out that it ran small and was comfortably big. I'd suggest ordering one size up!	positive
Rented this because a friend swore it was good. I told her several times this is the most regrettable $4 I’ve ever spent. Couldn’t even finish it.	negative
Helps offset overall redness but you need to use a lot since it doesn't have a lot of pigment. I still prefer that over some of the other green color-correctors I've tried. A little green goes a long way so the lighter color is safer to apply, especially if your foundation isn't high-pigment to cover up the green tint. I end up using more but at this price it's not a big deal.	positive
I never received this shirt!	negative
Ordered The Office Stickers and received this.	negative
Sorry I didn't read the reviews before ordering. This stroller is very cheaply made. The seat was ripped on delivery. There was no return slip. I put the stroller right in the garbage.	negative
Worst tire product ever....I applied it and did not drive my car for over 12 hours. Next time I drove the vehicle there was white splatter all over the wheels.	negative
I absolutely loved this little thing! It was exactly what I was looking for on my 6 day, 600 mile trip. The problem was the mount on the handlebars was way too weak and it fell off constantly. By day two a bump in the road sent it flying down a cliff and I never saw it again. If it were attached better, though, it would be a steal.	negative
Didn’t receive what item from the picture & wasn’t able to charge more listen to music at the same time	negative
Does not stick very well. Magnet is very weak	negative
This was to replace my broken band. One side of this one doesn't fit exactly right, so it has a gap in it.	negative
This wii is a piece of junk! Nothing works! I have tried it on all of our tv's and Nothing! What a waste of money! I bought this for my grandkids and it was a complete disappointment. I will never by from this company again. This experience has taught me not to buy anything that is refurbished.	negative
Makes the hair feel refreshed!!! Really like this product. Only use if your locks are settled in.....	positive
too expensive for what you get	positive
Very meaningful movie	positive
I’m really disappointed in this piece. I was excited to get extra room in our kitchen. When I went to put it together the predrilled holes did not line up with the holes in the iron piece for the top. I’m working on re-drilling holes now but they were 3+ cm off from where they needed to be in order to match up.	negative
Works decently enough for the price. Lights our walkways to the front and back doors, which was the goal due to a lack of streetlights in our neighborhood and our multiple short steps toward our home situated on a slight incline. Tip: Follow all instructions for maximum benefit.	positive
The buckles may be wonderful, but the bolts that come with it suck. Stainless on stainless, gall up within 4 turns. Just how I wanted to spend my evening, with the cutoff wheel....	negative
This is a board book for young children about Easter. I decided to toss this book, rather than give it to my granddaughter. In an effort to make a rhyming book, it uses way too many negative words for toddlers, such as dead, hate, etc. I think the Easter message should be a little softer and much more positive for that age group.	negative
This planter looks nothing like the photos that are featured. It is significantly lighter in color and the “metal” accent pieces look extremely fake. The material is so flimsy that it doesn’t hold its shape.	negative
This might be personal preference - but when I bought this pillow I thought memory foam is a bit more dense than that - the pillow is way too soft and not really lending support to my neck, so i ended up have to roll a towel under my neck. I suffer from neck and back pain, and need much support from my pillow, but this one is not it. Very disappointed	negative
Great band, very comfortable. Easy to adjust and I like that it has a little “give” when you bend your wrist unlike the silicone. I don’t like how silicone bands for the Versa the metal clasps can pull away or break apart from the silicone over time and these are built into the plastic, making them much more durable long-term.	positive
Ordered a large. Ran very short, I’m 5’10” and my butt hangs out. Missed the return window and now am stuck with a dress that doesn’t fit. Don’t order if your tall or want to keep a cute dress classy and not flash everyone..	negative
Received an empty envelope with no stickers	negative
the tool you use to slide out the key cylinder doesnt fit over the end of my new schlage entry lock. This makes this kit worthless, without the proper tool springs parts fly everywhere	negative
Very nice fit the money.	positive
This product has never been delivered. Numerous calls have been made to resolve issue. Poor customer service from seller.	negative
Love this show but missed the last season	positive
After one Wash and the arm strap fell off. I don't want to return it and try to fix it myself but very disappointed.	negative
A lot smaller than I expected	negative
This is perfect! Sturdy enough to keep my baby in, big enough an adult can easily fit inside with her and have room to spare. She is 14 months and I think this will easily last til 2 years old. Easy to assemble, safe and she loves it. Which means I do too!	positive
I am usually a 9.5, so I ordered a size 10 since I’m pregnant. I was unable to get my foot into the boot; my foot wouldn’t go in past the arch. My feet are not swollen (yet!) so I was disappointed that they didn’t fit. Had I been able to get my foot inside the boot, they looked as though they would have fit. They appear to be of good quality and are very attractive.	negative
I've worn this bra for years, and it is a really comfortable supportive bra and this is a great price. Unfortunately this batch is sewn with the fabric of the outer layer of the cups bigger than the lining so it's terribly wrinkled. I bought black, nude and white and they all had the same problem. I was very disappointed. Now I'll have to wait for a sale and buy them in person.	negative
Was a digital copy not a physical.	positive
As a car hauler when I load cars at night it's perfect I can see the car if it has any damages it's very bright it does the job	positive
Nice socks, but not as large as listed. I wear a size 15 shoe comfortably, and these socks will not pull over my heels, and slide down my foot immediately. They re simply not long enough.	negative
The acting is decent but I cannot continue to watch.	negative
It is hardy alright. 5 stars for that. But once the case is on the iPhone, the buttons become difficult to use. Emphasis on security has diluted the phone features.	negative
"A good Davidson episode. One of those ""back in time in England, preventing stranded aliens from destroying the Earth"" episodes. A bit of sublimated exasperation between the Doctor and the companions."	positive
I've have it a couple of weeks. It's still holding up really well. I don't wear it 24/7. Only when I'm going out and I take it off when I'm home.	positive
Fit my current dryer and doesn't come off when I put it away in my basket under the counter! Great diffuser! and stays on the dryer well! Very sturdy! Highly recommend!	positive
What’s to not like. Better than expected. Heavy weight wood. Looks great nicely finished Would recommend this product.	positive
Perfect as described.	positive
Was really excited to use the tuner however it was broken upon arrival. I am not sure if it is broken or it came with a dead battery but it won’t turn on and I have not even been able to try it out.	negative
Packaging, instructions, finish, etc., are all good. Stream is fairly narrow.	positive
A story beautifully told, wonderful relationships of friendship and love. Worth reading.	positive
The bells keep calling if the chains. The nut that holds the bells on the base come undone allowing all the bells to fall to the floor. First time it happened I thought it was a fluke. No, it happens about once a month. Wouldn't recommend.	positive
My daughter is obsessed w this bike. She’s 1.5 and fits perfect. My only complaints is that the steering is almost too sensitive and I have to really grip it to control it and I wish there was a cup holder for me. I would recommend	positive
The book was much smaller than I thought it would be.	negative
Easy to use and the adhesive to paper is quite strong. Great for photo magnets.	positive
These are what I expected. Good size. I’m happy with them.	positive
Good for the price, scratchy movement as expected.	positive
Excellent quailty,I would definitely recommend this collar .Well made and attractive!	positive
I haven't used this cooker yet. A part is missing	negative
I like the more flexible aspect of these cases. I only wish there was room inside for a CD cover.	positive
Women have a tendency to be caretakers and not honor their own needs. This book illustrates a woman that looks after her own needs and meshes them with those in her life.	positive
I'm sort of a amateur Civil War history buff, and was initially attracted by the title. It took a while to get my head around the role-changing represented for many of the Civil War's main characters, but this is a wonderfully crafted what-if story if the US had went a slightly different way in the 75 years or so preceding the Civil War. The author has definitely left us hanging, though, with a strong hint of sequels to follow. I can wait for what comes next!	positive
I used to love the Rockports. They didn't fit at all not even close.	negative
I have a problems with connecting my USB cable and headphones- couldn't connect tight enough. The cut-outs in the case are not good enough.	negative
This product was a gift. The person I gave it to is enjoying it immensely.	positive
I hadn’t realized this was the small version of the standard size when I ordered so I wanted to warn others who may not be aware either. Not such a good deal anymore 😬	negative
Looks real from far away! Light and delicate like the real thing up close. Really excited to see how it looks with my wedding dress for our beach wedding.	positive
This Bugs 3 drone is awesome...pure manual control ,very agile and pure fun . I love the acrobatic feature and the sensitivity on the control and those powerfull brushless motors. I attached my go pro and had great arial captures. This drone is not boring at all. You can also buy extra battery with different spec for A/H for longer flights. This is the kind of drone years from now should be on your display wall....someday some will ask you what your drones treasures are ...I would start with the Bugs series :)	positive
Froze up was not new sent a return item	negative
The sweeping action is really smooth and can be easily adjusted. The bag doesn't hold much, so it has to be emptied often. Brushes seem to hold pine needles and any vines get really wrapped. Not a game changer. just accept this regular cleaning as normal maintenance	positive
Love this! Really good quality and perfect for my bathroom. The picture is a little lighter in color than the advertisement but still really good, not distorted or blurry.	positive
Didn’t really like the product , but I guess you get what you pay for	negative
Containers/box came busted open	negative
Didn’t work as well as others products offered on Amazon!	negative
These are really fresh and salted just right. Very tender too.	positive
Works as advertised even through a very cold winter.	positive
Thinner than I expected. They do not stay secured around the seat. I would not order them again	negative
They work really well exactly what I needed	positive
Almost immediately I started to feel a difference. The arch support and comfort on my heels started making my foot pain go away.	positive
The microphone volume is super low. The toy makes sounds at a good level but I didn't buy a noise maker.	negative
I trimmed considerable lengths of wire for a custom fit in my truck. If you're OK with soldering and heat shrinking it's an excellent package. No wiring diagram, but if you've done basic wiring it's obvious and easy. The remote works a treat.	positive
Cute and even more comfortable than expected. Nice quality.	positive
I bought it as a replacement for my sound core nano thinking it would be louder since it's approximately the same size but newer. I still think the Nano is a bit louder. Also, the build quality of the Nano is way better. Hey Anker... just remake the Nano and mass produce it again. I'll find a use for the Ao, eventually, I'm sure.	positive
A few quirks and maybe a too much writing where not necessary. Biggest issue was using a word that no person in any conversation ever uses. Meniscus is never used in reference to the surface of water by anyone ever in the history of conversations. Please stop trying to use it unless talking about your knee.	positive
The material is very cheap	negative
We have a table on the side of our fridge that has the coffee maker, toaster, and all that goes with them (sugar, creamer, butter dish, etc.). Having the paper towels so handy makes for quick clean up!	positive
Great quality & they look amazing, but I ordered size 9 for my husband, & they're way too small. They're probably closer to a 7 because they fit my finger perfectly. Also, we only got 4 rings & not the 5 I originally ordered.	negative
I would return if I could but it’s too late. It’s horrible and wasted my money.	negative
I have asian eyes and thought it would be impossible for fake eyelashes to be too short. Well these are. Additionally, they are so hard to put on. How do people do it? I thought these would be super easy! I would not reommend this product at all.	negative
Bought for daughters room. Looks good and she loves it. She is three. It's a smaller room so it works well. I would not put this in s larger room though.	positive
Took a long time to receive. One of the batteries was bad. Other than that OK	positive
great product but don't believe the packaging! it says 1 tsp stevia is equal to 2 tsp sugar. it is way sweeter and you should add significantly less. i made some sweet tea and put 1/2 the amount of stevia than i normally put of sugar and it doesnt taste like like tea anymore just stevia. once you get the balance down though its great.	positive
Christmas present for my son. He loved it. He assembled it and tested it put has not had a chance to use it yet because of the season. He is looking forward to the chance to go fishing. He liked the metal reel and the case, for convenience and longevity,	positive
Definitely does not hold as much as I expected. The dividers make certain sections too small to fit anything so I ended up just tossing them. Bag is very hard and bulky. Makeup brushes do not fit in the slots provided on the side without messing up the brush hairs.	negative
Does not fit cabinets that do not have flat surface all around	negative
Received product today and it was broken inside the pakage	negative
This lock box is easy to install , very safety and so convenient,very useful.	positive
It was nice while it lasted. Chain broke after only 2 days. I fixed it but it was annoying.	positive
I did not realize I purchased a cream/gel and had been using a cream only previously. This product was not as effective as the cream only version.	negative

Good quality PLA and it works really well on my machine I have printed several things (using about half of the roll) big and small and it’s worked well for everything.	positive
This item was damage on arrival. Almost not worth the hassle to return for a replacement. l have been disappointed with Amazon and the products they offer/supply. To add to the disappointment delivery was delayed when promised within two days. Prime is not so “prime” anymore!	negative
The headlamps were easy to install. There is a concern that they are two different sizes. As you can see on the passenger side, I can insert two quarters in the gap between the body and the lens. On the driver side, there are four quarters inserted in the gap. Not good.	negative
Decent pair of chairs for the price	positive
Never received item. Seller put wrong address on item and wad delivered to another city. We never saw the item	negative
Started making a horrible noise day 3. Noise clears up after a minute. Annoying that it was brand new.	negative
I love this paddle because it is so light and the grip is awesome!	positive
Ordered this phone for my Mother and we could not keep the charging cord in the phone. The prongs are located inside the phone to far and cord would not connect and stay connected. Returned for credit and ordered new one for replacement. Hopefully the new one works better...	negative
Bought as an xmas gift for son. Backpack is roomy and sturdy. Bought a battery pack for the USB.	positive
The cookies arrived crumbled. I would like a refund please. I purchased two boxes.	negative
Terrible. Eats thru string like a piglet. And after 3 uses, the Spool just shattered	negative
Love the colors and the feel of the fabric, but the fabric is very cheap and they started to fall apart after one use!	negative
Good boots, a little on the hard side. Put in some cushions and they're great.	positive
Spout drips A LOT. Making a mess all over the counter. Dawn is a great product. Dispenser spout is awful.	negative
Slowly drops down until it hits my keyboard. Tiny screw and Allen wrench to adjust the weight balance is a joke. Everything seems sturdy and well made except the most import part, the hinge. Like the other reviewer said I'm going to jam paper in the hinge to keep it from slowly sinking. Save your money, buy another brand.	negative
This is a double cuff pouch. Do not order if you are just looking for a regular cuff pouch. It is not as described. And it is not shown in the pictures.	negative
I love this lamp but the small lamp clip that is to be used to hold the small globe on is missing. I have a small hose clamp holding that globe on currently.	negative
Great price! I decorate them for work ID badges	positive
Bought this to give my third bathroom shower a nice design pop and it does it’s job. Good quality material and looks great.	positive
Never received the product.	negative
Don't taste it at all whether in my flavored water or on food. Clumps are a bit tough to dissolve, but eventually do. Trying to to keep my gut healthy and this should help.	positive
These will be returned. I bought an XL based on the size charts and reviews. I understand they are not meant to have much support, but they were way too loose. I am a 36D and they did me no favors. Also the cup liners felt too small and showed through my shirts.	negative
This was the last one and it does not disappoint.	positive
Have to figure out what is the best input to use. I tried the optical on my ATT receiver and the volume was poor. However, when connected to the TV optical it was much better. It still isn't quite as loud as I would have liked it to be, but it's good enough. The bluetooth audio seems to be louder than I can get from the TV. Other negative is having to use a 2nd remote (soundbar) to change the volume since I can't get it to work with my ATT remote.	positive
This is a great product that fits nicely. Snug enough to show shape and lose enough that I can still breath.	positive
Smaller than expected.	negative
... it's also not easy to open and close. We should be able to buy a better non-metal belt than this.	negative
So....there's only 1 lid for the 3 boxes. I guess I didn't catch that in the description. Definitely would not have bothered buying these if I had known. Also, pretty light construction, so probably won't hold up to a lot of use. Definitely puts my reorganizing project on hold until I buy replacements. Not pleased.	negative
A little big. Besides that it's nice.	positive
This sleep sack is cute and soft however the neckline comes up too high for my baby where she’s able to grab the material and start biting on it. I have one that’s more of a v neck that works better.	negative
Extremely poor quality for gaming, upon arrival 4 keys did not work and the interior fell apart after a few weeks. 0/10 would not recommend.	negative
I'm glad to know the chemical is safe for us and our pets, because it does have a strong chemical odor that lingers for up to a day. Also, we've bought 3 bottles of this product and 2 of the 3 squeeze nozzles have broken. The product itself definitely does the job, but its important to note that treatment needs to be kept up for up to a year cause bedbugs/ eggs can stay dormant a long time. We have also used a steamer as another treatment along with this product.	positive
This product worked pretty well for my son's costume. His hair is very dark and it was mostly covered in grey.	positive
So soft and fit well	positive
This is so cute! Way better than I expected. The material isn’t great but the outfit still looks cute.	positive
Made me feel like I was being manipulated through propaganda. I hate that. No thank you.	negative
"My first experience with these authors. Enjoyed the novel, thank you. Though characters are interesting and everything was kept ""real"" none of the superhero bulletproof games, the general story line is well traveled...Shall continue reading the series to see what evolves"	positive
Try to bring it on a original Pandora Bracelet. It is not possible.	negative
Like it plug many things in it and seems charge faster	positive
Good quality. Excellent taste. Will purchase from this company again.	positive
Did not do anything for me. No difference	negative
The color is great, the issue I have is when I turn the bulb off it flashes while their off, I bought the 2 pk and tried the other one and it flashes also, it's very annoying I would send them back but it's more of an issue to pack them up go to ups and drop them off, not satisfied with this product.	negative
Well considering that my truck sits in the driveway most of the time not being used, the fact that these lights only worked for 2 months before they quit working and only just flash all the time now ... NO THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY! And since I can't return them after a month, it was a waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY!!!	negative
Charges but does not play music from my iPhone 7 from my older iHome...what can I do??	negative
Worthless. It's terreible when a product does not exactly what it says it does. Not what I expected .	negative
It does its job. Great tool to have if you own QSC Subs	positive
like a plastic, i hated it!!	negative
Awesome quality. Works great. Amazing price.	positive
Great quality. Wonderful product. Fast shipping.	positive
Product did not work, bought a two pack neither of them worked for transmitting data will let you charge that’s it .	negative
Not right size on chest no matter what size you get, too much side boob	negative
Very preliminary, not much new stuff. Would not recommend this book. Seems like the content is not fully developed yet	negative
In the bottle, several of the capsules had come apart and the content distributed across the remainder. I realized this the hard way. As I placed a capsule in my mouth, and prior to swallowing, I breathed inward. Thus, I sucked cinnamon and cayenne dust into my lungs. I thought I was going to die. Coughing, burning lungs, eyes watering, etc for about a half hour. I have no idea whether the product is otherwise any good, as I tossed the remainder into the trash.	negative
Fit and quality very impressive	positive
a bit too sweet and sugary	negative
Doesn’t really endure much for heavy work. I work out on the ramp handling bags and it tore after a bout 2/3 weeks of wearing it. It might work for a less strenuous type of work.	negative
over a month waiting on shipping from China(?)and one of 2 ordered was cracked, don't know where I can't see the crack but as I hand washed for first use the mug filled with water.	negative
Right size but was not impressed. Returned.	negative
Parts are not cheap, but functionality is very poor. It simply doesn't doo enough. Doesn't raise laptop high enough or feel secure when it is holding it. Returned it, despite its flexibility.	negative
l should have read reviews if there is way to remove key after you lock it wasent disclosed mind you its not hard for me to remove a key from a lock but with this gas cap lock impossible	negative
I love the softness of these hand towels. I would definitely recommend!	positive
If your buying for a child it should be fine.	negative
Good quality. Comfy.	positive
The ipad turns off and on does not want to charge	negative
"Excellent comfort and lightweight warmth for the price. It doesn't completely ""fill out"" my duvet cover, so I sometimes struggle to get the duvet to lie nice and flat after washing. Usually that goes away after a few days of use."	positive
Works very well. Little scrubbing needed.	positive
that's not what I expected . and it is very small, it has no pockets, very expensive for how little it is. It looks like a doll backpack.	negative
I believe this product to be a return as the packaging was not great. Easy installation but once installed, the lock would not take codes on the first try, would not auto-lock after 3 seconds, and made a very loud grinding sound before and after the lock mechanism was slowly engaged. The app is also lacking as there is no way to know which code you are sending someone. I returned the item.	negative
Totally wrong screws! Not even close to what is pictured. I was looking for window hinge bolts for my CJ7 like what is pictured in the description. The ones I received are button head fine thread. I have attached a picture below. I would have just returned them but it’s a pain and I’m not sure if This was the wrong screws by mistake or what they think is the correct part. Order with caution.	negative
So far so good just wish use time was long then 6 hours.	positive
the controller for the remote stopped working within the first week. ordered another and the same thing happened. The lights are great, but you can't use the remote which is a shame	negative
The fit is good but the waist line was a bit lower than expected.	positive
I like that this can collapse. Four stars cuz you need two hands to carry it. I use this all the time.	positive
This was a big hit for Christmas. We loved that we could put whatever saying that we wanted. Great for office party's.	positive
I used it for my YouTube channel, it doesn't appear in the video but in my opinion these are very professional. The recording quality is very good, you will not do anything wrong for this price.	positive
Only lasted one winter	negative
Very nice product. Small footprint and I like the draining function of the insert.	positive
I like it because it was portable Did not like it was a little hard to put on	positive
garbage after 2 weeks they don’t work	negative
Very comfortable and the perfect size.	positive
"Now that is an EXCELLENT story! From the start of ""Men Under Fire"" to the very end it has you under it's spell. With a great cast of characters and a well written storyline you will not be able to put it down. Loved it! Happy Reading:)"	positive
IT YOU ALREADY HAVE MOUTH PIECES YOU LIKE OR NEED NEW ONES THIS IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE EXPENSIVE STUFF. IT REALLY WORKS.	positive
The hinges on the device do not allow the lid to close as it should. I was very upset about the construction.	negative
Great bag until it falls apart. I have the smallest light laptop that I used to carry around in it and it still busted everywhere :(. No one has answered me as to if I can return this bag or not.	negative
This tablecloth is extremely thin and poor quality. Also, stains easily & even with pre-wash solution does not come clean. Definitely do not recommend.	negative
Just tapioca, usable for thickening, or baking. Very bland does not add taste.	negative
Slow developing at the beginning but it won't end like you might think. This is a very entertaining true indie film.	positive
It never got here ??? Why not ???	negative
I used them between the curtains on my bed room. These are absolutely gorgeous! You’ll never fine a better price!	positive
Honestly, my own glue and water concoction worked better, and this DID affect color.	negative
Love it! Smells like roses. I use this as a toner and makeup setting spray.	positive
I found it difficult to use and then also found there’s a no return policy that I was not aware of.	negative
This product was excellent...very easy to work with and the packs were full. I used this for large box braids and it was plenty. I plan on purchasing again I bought the ombre purple and ombre blue	positive
this is for long term memory protection. I'm 72 now so maybe in 10 or 15 years I'll know more.	positive
Well designed gig bag. Like the green color too.Good zippers and room for your stuff.	positive
These were a good size for smaller kids. They have not broken yet, update, still in gpod shape not broken or bent! Love these.	positive
I love these mats. I always wanted to get rubber mats versus the fabric ones that came with my car. I finally decided to order them! I still can’t get that rubber smell out of my car though.	positive
Do not purchase! This was the worst thing I have every spent my money on. Not only did it not work but it fell apart when I tried to install the battery. Would give 0 starts if possible.	negative
These light are great, easy to use just pull apart then wrap around the umbrella pole, holds on securely where you want it, provides 3 light setting, bright light. When done with the lights either turn them off or remove the batteries and store them away for the next time. Set of 2 lights. Great buy.	positive
The first time I unwrapped it to install in the window, it got stuck and broke. The mesh was also not attached to the frame which defeated the purpose of the item. Very poor quality.	negative
It's very nice and dishwasher safe btw but if your mask is thick at all don't bother using this it'll slip right off, and it's a little hard to get into the nose area	positive
"Very disappointed. This size is made to get close to scalp. So surprised when the last 3"" where the plates are was so hot on the outside it burns. Even the rubber finger grips get extremely hot."	negative
First one never worked. Company replaced it with another one. Replacement lasted about one month before it quit working. Do not recommend this unit at all. Spent a little more money and bought a better one. You get what you pay for!	negative
Waste of money. Product doesn't work!!!!	negative
Just as described! Works well with as dip ink and with paint brushes!	positive
These are very cheap plastic that cannot be stacked without falling over.	negative
"A fake, non Apple product. Real Apple chargers say Designed by ""Apple"" in California. No UL listing icon either. Thankfully I identified this before using and possibly damaging my expensive iPad Pro. Live and learn."	negative
I was impressed with how sparkly the case was! The case itself has held up quite well but the material that holds the phone in is horribly discolored. This is my 11 year old daughters phone and she takes very good care of it. These pictures are after t was cleaned with alcohol which cleaned nothing off of it... The sparkly part is still in good condition but the discolored part looks gross.	negative
Bought as replacement part. Arrived damaged, impossible to know if it was damaged during shipping or at some other point. I suppose it’s better than buying a new microwave, but buyer beware that it will probably break again, and be sure to inspect it carefully when it arrives, especially if shipped in a bubble wrap envelope.	negative
One of these won’t turn off after just over the return date. Not happy.	negative
Great tape. Use to wrap wrists and ankle for weight training. Easy to tear and good support. Only complaint about product is that the roll becomes tight toward the end. Makes it hard to wrap.	positive
Used it for Spectra with high mileage, now it's shifting better	positive
This was helpful for doing sit-ups and push ups.	positive
Did not recieve this book. Tracking says it was delivered on Sept 8th inside my door. It was NOT.	negative
Not as easy to use and the smaller one that had extra tabs to make application a snap	positive
Doesn't work with Alexa	negative
One of the best headphones I’ve ever had...	positive
Im using these for a while and I love it. I wear it under my dress and now when its humid and hot they keep me away from chafing. They ate sexy as well and very soft on the skin. Fits true to size.	positive
Both my husband and I rent books through Amazon for our classes and have never had a problem..... until now. This book is labeled as being in “good” condition. If this is truly “good” I don’t want to see anything less than this quality. Now I want to make sure Amazon sees it was received in this condition and not from being in my possession when this is sent back. Will probably continue to rent through Amazon just sad about this one.	negative
Turned my wrist green after wearing two days.	negative
I’ve used this case for years for my phone and sometimes other items like keys and money to keep everything dry. It awesome, works as detailed the only qualm is that after about 6 months of usage the locks gets worn down and stop closing all the way so I make sure to be extra careful whenever that time comes.	positive
Wrinkled all over. Would have been good if firm.	negative
I use this for a reading light in my bedroom. It does a great job. The light illuminates about 24 inches or larger in diameter so it’s not just a beam on your book. This is helpful for reading in different positions. I’ve found the various light colors to be helpful depending on what I’m reading. One color is much better for reading a red letter bible than the others.	positive
The story is creative and intense and captivating. The characters are all intertwined and interesting. This is a great story by Barbara	positive
gave them to a friend & he liked them !!!!	negative
Good project car lots off of upgrade parts fyi buy ball bearing kit with this purchase plastic bushing wear out fast	positive
These are the right screws to mount drawer slides. I tried buying screws from the local big box home improvement stores. Those screws did not work. I will always buy a pack of these screws when I buy a 10 pack of drawer slides.	positive
The rear wheel doesn't have traction. Will not work on dirt very well. Very disappointed.	negative
My cat wouldn't touch it- was more like minced that pate-	negative
Nice colors and good quality. I haven't tried them though, because I bought these for gifts, so I don't know if they work well. So far, so good.	positive
I was really excited about these and I was very surprised at how noisy the lining is. I could hear rustling as I walked in them. I am very disappointed.	negative
The material is slippery and runs small so the pants slide down off my hips a lot.	negative
Don't know what happened to this order? Never did hatch?	negative
Poor quality. Hole within five hours.	negative
The top suction part came off a month after using and it now spills every time I close the top. Is there anyway I can buy a new suction part?	negative
I used it for my daughters wedding best wishes and it was a great night for it easy to use	positive
a little thin still a nice	positive
I was worried I would need to replace all the railing on my front porch. This was all I needed. Thanks!	positive
"So far.. perfect, perfect, perfect! Oh wait. No wall mount? Hmmm. Not pretty enough for my living room. Absurd standing on kitchen counter and my bedroom is too far away. Sorta beautifies my garage... but.. No. Hmmm. Might have to build a wall mount with a power ""on and off"" button."	positive
After just 2 or 3 days the back button on the bottom right of the phone has all but stopped working for me.	negative
So cute. Heavy and warm . It was too big which was great he grew into it. Has held up threw many washings and is ready to be handed down. Held the color really well.	positive
price and comfort were right in my budget	positive
Perfect in small spaces, the base of this is so small but sturdy. I set up in a lot of different places and never had an issue. Love this design so much more than a tripod version.	positive
Thanks, it would be nice if the vest secured sounder, and had heavier duty handles. Otherwise it is a good product	positive
Was great for our party!	positive
Very readable. Didn’t care for the ending. Why would someone in her condition put her life on the line? It wasn’t necessary. Liked all but the last two pages.	positive
After less than a month none of the chargers worked. The company sent out replacements and those lasted 2 weeks. Waste of money and time.	negative
"After slightly more than a year of use the ""brushed aluminum"" finish is flaking off revealing what looks like pot metal underneath. I will have to throw it away soon and buy something else."	negative
"I will be returning this ""new"" item which has clearly already been opened by someone else. The box was ripped and had a dirty residue all over the back. Inside the package, the battery was missing. Who knows if the stylus actually works or not- without the battery I can't use it."	negative
very nice for the price. excellent on low power however a little hard to focus at higher power	positive
The product fits my Kenmore refrigerator perfect. The only issue I have is that you have to dump 15 gallons of water before drinking the water. That’s a lot of water	negative
my favorite brand at great prices!	positive
Very compact, but roomy enough to hold all my credit cards, some cash and my driver’s license, but still fit comfortably in my pants pocket. Really like the fact that it has the information protection (RFID). Very pleased with the quality. Vendor has had correspondence twice already and is very eager to please the customer. I would definitely purchase this product and purchase from this vendor again!	positive
It's a very good product. It has waist pain all the time after pregnancy. It works much better after using this product.	positive
Uh I received these gloves rather than the product I ordered.. I checked my tracking number and yep.. it matched.	negative
I didn’t like it because there is no fitted excellent	negative
This simply didn't work. No way. No how. Threw it away. Should not have bought it. This was meant to be a replacement for the one stolen by the neighborhood kids. Now I have a new weather station from another company and can buy replacement parts if necessary.	negative
Thick and long, this mat is perfect for outdoor yoga/pilates/core. The material provided a good gripping surface so no sliding during planks.	positive
My 16 month old son enjoyed this, but after just a month of playing with it, one of the seams came undone and he came to me covered in blue goo. Luckily he was smart enough to not try eating any, but he had me scared looking up what the goo is made of to make sure it wouldn't hurt him being on his skin. Do not buy!	negative
Amazing sound machine! The sounds are so soothing and I sleep so well after having it.	positive
perfect starter pack for your new family member	positive
Broke the second day.	negative
Quiet and does what it says. Good buy	positive
Didnt fit my 2008 Chrysler town and country touring	negative
These were really a waste of money...they don't stay put or they get buried way deep between the cusion and the back or arm.	negative
ARRIVED ON TIME & IT'S PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED, I PLAN TO USE THEM TO HANG UP A BIRD WATER & FOOD FEEDER IN A TREE JUST OUTSIDE OUR BAY WINDOW.	positive
It was a decent sound machine for the price. I did not like how you had to turn the whole machine off to turn the nightlight off though. However, my real reason for the negative review is that the machine has stopped working. About 7 months of use and now it won’t turn on. Luckily, this happened the day all my family left after the holidays. If it had broken while everyone was here I know my child would never have slept.	negative
Failed in about 60 days. Cord is fine but the switch doesn’t work.	negative
I bought this product but ended up by nothing it says it was delivered almost a week ago but I'm still waiting.	negative
Never arrived. Contacted Amazon and seller but haven't heard back. Not sure what the problem is, but it feels sorta scammy... I want my money back.	negative
I have using ZMODO product since last 3 years and I still love it . It's keeps you connected .	positive
Mount is very tall and is no very stable when the phone is installed. No matter how much you tighten the lock the phone still moves	negative
Right out of the box it wouldn’t pump liquid. You can hear the pump but after trying three liquid products I have decided that it is not very good. Save your money.	negative
I really like how this ring looks. I ordered it to go along with the rest of my rose gold jewelry. Sadly it is a little big for my pinky although I did get a size 4. All the diamonds are intact and very pretty :). Would recommend this ring for stacking or for a quick little sparkle to add to an outfit.	positive
Dumb and violent. Not sure what the appeal is with this one. Too much internal dialogue. If you like reading about abused women, I guess ...seek counseling.	negative
I cried a few tears while reading this story	positive
Decent product, good price. Already showing some signs of wear in a relatively short period of time, but I am pretty tough on keyboards, so that is probably ok. It is fairly loud, but this is to be expected for this type of keyboard. Very good price, so if it fails I will just replace it.	positive
dropped my phone it still broke the screen underneath.	negative
The item did not work, button was not functional.	negative
I would not buy. For what you get Dumb bells are cheaper and more versatile	negative
Ordered a four pack and only received 3 would like my money for the forth bottle back. This is the second time I have had a problem receiving this item the first time I didn't receive the order at all now I was shorted a bottle. it was in a bag that said sold as a set do not seperated but the bag had been open	negative
Accurate description of product. Glove size accurate as well.	positive
I did have to replace it within 6 years, but I like the way if buffs my tile. And moderately priced.	positive
Nice shades. Only draw back are that the arms scratch my head when I put them on.	positive
She easy to install and looks great! I’m using two in either side of my bathroom mirror. They provide a good amount of light, but could also be used in a bedroom or hallway and wouldn’t be too overpowering. I love the industrial/ farmhouse look of them. Very trendy and great priced!	positive
Works great, just wish it could of had a molle attachment	positive
This was a beautiful item and would make a special mother day gift. My mom passed away sadly before I could give it to her. I know she would have loved it though and I will now cherish it and think of her.	positive
Love this author. Book is an easy but fun read. Make sure you read the entire trilogy.	positive
I bought these for use in my home gym located in my garage. My barbell gets very cold in the winter and these gloves add a layer of insulation to keep my hands from getting frostbite. The quality is very nice for the price, there is a good amount of padding on palms but it does not interfere with the feel of the bar. The wrist straps are a nice addition but I don't use them at this time.	positive
This is the second such stand I have bought. One was for my daughter who plays clarinet, and now for my granddaughter who is learning to play clarinet. Sturdy, affordable and last a long time.	positive
"This is a great item. I use it with a weight rack for my home gym, and it's incredible how easy it moves around 300lbs. I suggest using a youtube video titled ""HTC 2000 Mobile Base Assembly"", which makes the installation process a breeze. Without the video, it would take about twice as long. You'll thank me later."	positive
Bought one for my son. Front tire snapped after the first ten minutes he played with it. Sent for a refund. In the meantime ordered one more as a replacement. This one the back wheel snapped right away as well. Poor design.	negative
The temps do not match what other temps give. I would hit a spot first time it is once temp the next time it is a totally different temp and never has given close to same temp twice. Next time ill spend a little more money to get a better product.	negative
Got this for my son for Christmas and its Exactly what we wanted! He loves it	positive
The headphones don’t even show up in devices.	negative
It's an Ethernet cable. It's blue and it is 100 ft. long. It works. I have not noticed any Ethernet packets leaking out of the cable. What else is there to say?	positive
It stretched out after only a few washes. It doesn't fit my frame and i am pretty disappointed.	negative
Hi. I got my incomplete package, I bought 2 and only came 1	negative
Returned...could not use because it was not put together well...top bolt attached at angle making harp bent	negative
Purchase silicone inserts and couldn't tell a difference with them.	negative
I skipped through beautiful descriptive prose and prismatic relationships to connect the first chapter. It never fully happened, but the reviewer took care of that and way more...summary, analysis, historical context and short biography. I came away feeling quite ready for a final exam on the reviewer's Rebecca.	positive
broke within 5 uses and less than 1 month from when we received it- terrible quality. Hose diameter is also too narrow so the hose retracts whenever you spray- very annoying.	negative
Very nice. Lovely in the bathroom corner and doesn't look as messy as a regular 'tree' Plus the shelves hold baskets filled with towels and clay pots with my make up brushes and whatnot. Took some time to put together but was really easy to follow. I guess I would give it 5 stars if I thought the wood and basic design was a little more top of the line. But it's not going to lose function or get ruined by heavy use anyway.	positive
Seems to do the job but I pair with a caffeine pre workout, definitely got me over a plateau	positive
Finishing on the dress looks cheap the material on the back looks like what is use to line suit cases and and bags and I have to give a star to submit my comment it's not worth a star	negative
It is small little,rolls,and,hard. I like that,there is,no tube but I prefer the 1000 sheet rolls,which are softer.	negative
Doesn't work on Amazon fire stick for any device. Not Google. Not iOS. Waste of money.	negative
Really good value. I didn’t need many of the inserts. I am fussy about my day planner and make my own calendar pages. I would prefer only three rings - lots of holes to punch! Cover is thick ( it is nice but I would like a thinner one). Great value. A little smaller in size than I thought - as I said I make my own calendar pages which is half a sheet of paper 4.25 x 5.5 (half of 8.5 x 11). I had to trim them all down to fit.	positive
Too small of a diaper bag to fit all of the essentials in. It's also awkward at the top where the main opening is - very rigid, not flexible.	negative
It does seem to moisturize but the problem with it is it’s very watery which makes it difficult to use. I end up getting more of it on the floor than on my skin.	negative
works as advertised folds up just as easy makes changing for the shy more comfortable	positive
Recommend this book for a good read. Will definitely read more from this author. Looking forward to getting updates on the author.	positive
Bought this product for my new tattoo shop because a lot of clients were asking to charge their phone, and I always out of the phone charger cables, and always lost control of where to put all the phones. After I got this station, it worked so good you can just plug one outlet in, and you have so many ports that you can charge the phones at the one place. No more messy desk. Highly recommend to any of you looking to charge a lot of phones at the same time.	positive
Low quality. Doesnt stay together... you get what you pay for.	negative
I bought it to save a few dollars. It was my mistake. It didn't stick well and I would be able to take it off very easily once it is applied. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars and get a high rated one with over 500 reviews. I can't even return this item. Wasted money.	negative
I loved this necklace and got a TON of compliments on it! However, after owning it for less than 2 months, it broke. The tassel part broke off where it is soldered to the ring. I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful piece of jewelry and so versatile! I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.	positive
Material is cheap and easily torn, and far too shiny and thin to be effective for steampunk style. Zipper is weak and gets stuck easily.	negative
These did not fit like the photo shows. They’re very wide at the calf. I would have preferred a fit like the photo. They’re super comfortable but almost too comfortable if that makes sense. Felt more like pj’s than yoga crop pants. Funky fit.	negative
Very nice gloves, warm as can be, and fit perfectly...Great product...Thanks	positive
They are very short, not what I had hoped for.	positive
Ordered twice by mistake. need to cancel	negative
If you want to give yourself a headache trying to install somthing that should take 10 minutes but ends up taking 90 minutes, this is the toilet paper dispenser for you!	negative
The product claims to be tempered glass. But it is not! It even bends. The directions state that there are 2 peel off protectors -- one for each side. But this is not the case, only one side has the peel off protective layer. I really wanted glass because it would resist scratches better than plastic. If I wanted plastic, I could have gotten it for a lot less money.	negative
Would not leave at my door now they want me to go pick up package at UPS. The whole point of buying on Amazon was so I didn’t have to go out after work. If they can’t leave it at the door I don’t need it. It can set at the shipping facility and I will go to a local retail and buy it from now on.	negative
Not going to read any more McDermitt books, was so depressed by what’s happened with one of main heroes- Alex, and how her death was described in details. It is definitely just me and my emotions, but would not recommend to read this book	negative
Did not stay in my ear. Sent them back.	negative
Have had it for 2 days. So far so good. Only thing I do not like, but may be a house outlet issue, is it does not sit flush on my wall. Yes did remove original face plate of old outlet. Not sure if this is a product issue or not. Have set the timer and love the nightlite feature. So far so good. We have a dual broadband router and I had nonissue hooking it up to 2.4ghz.	positive
Worked ok while it lasted, but one day it just stopped working, 2 weeks after the warranty expired. Pros: Very powerful Cons: Loud and you need to push quite hard to operate it.	negative
Great book. This is an interesting and informative book. I just wish there was more detail. I was recently told that I am an empath. I was not sure what that meant. I identified with the descriptions given here. Now I know why I become overwhelmed in large crowds and become overwhelmed by emotions sometimes.	positive
Charger stops charging momentarily every few minutes for a while, making the phone ding to indicate it is charging when it starts again. Wife and I are both using these, on iphone 8's. It is seriously impacting out sleep if we don't turn our ringers off.	negative
I wore it to a local Art Walk w/some cha-cha pumps and created a sensation with my deconstructed look! Upon my 2nd even, many of the cheap nylon ribbons were starting to show wear; by my 3rd, the metal had become exposed through the cheap material.	negative
I bought this to use with a MacBook Pro. It works fine and is nice and compact. Seems a little cheaply-made, but I don't anticipate using it that much so it should be fine. No complaints!	positive
Difficult for my husband to put together and poor instructions, but excellent buy for the price.	positive
I feel sorry for the workers in the plant that make this stuff. Holy cow do these smell foul. I placed these outside to air out and can small from at leas 10 feet away. Not certain if I'm going to keep yet or return. Will report back in 30 days.	negative
never caught one rat. traps are tripped, bait is gone. maybe they are for small rats, which ours are not.	negative
It says it is a 4 pack, but I only received 3.	negative
The wine decanter was just as expected. I am happy with it.	positive
Half the bottle was gone smells very strong made me very nauseous	negative
Very cheaply made! Does not at all look 3D. Very disappointed	negative
These ropes are great for a puppy not an adult dog.	negative
Super cute great for the price. My three year old looks adorable in this	positive
I need a reliable way to connect to the internet and my computer doesn't come with an ethernet port. This one does what it is supposed to so I am satisfied. It also comes with 3 USB ports that I use to connect to external hard drives, cellphone, and camera. It would be great if it has a USB-C power pass-thru port so I can charge my MacBook Pro as well.	positive
My favorite vitamins. Good product.	positive
Very snug fit. Very well padded. Great protector. Hard to install bc so snug, but it’s great bc once the iPad is in it won’t budge.	positive
earring kept opening up, would not stay on my ears	negative
It's a good moisturizer for the dead of winter or those bitter cold months. It does leave some residue so be sure to spread the product out completely. It can be a little bit oily feeling in the warmer months because I don't need as much hydration. I like the smell but it is powerful for those sensitive to that sort of thing. I like to apply it at night so it doesn't mess with my makeup. Overall, a good product that I will reach for next winter.	positive
Fantastic! We used this product on countertops in a house that we were renting. It looks really good and added the finishing touch.	positive
Works great for those who may want to apply a leave-in conditioner over night. It is tight about your head so it did seem to give me a headache after a bit. The quality is great and pattern is cute.	positive
There were two cuts on the back of couch.	negative
Defective. The pin page doesn't come up. Called Amazon tech support who walked me through the troubleshooting process like it was my first time looking at a computer. Was really unhelpful and I'm not even sure he was listening. Then, I was referred to ASUS technical support only to connect with another equally inept male technician who insulted me further, and so I'm returning the product after hours online, troubleshooting and dealing with horrible tech reps from amazon and asus. It's a defective pc, the one I received.	negative
Good product, easy to assembly and function great with good power and revolutions.	positive
Great for, great ability to move around, even in carpet! No wear after a couple months.	positive
Thought it was good until I got a few feet into it and about 27” was unusable.	negative
Nice design, but very thin, almost transparent. Probably won't last after a few washings.	negative
Wish you could buy only prongs. My dog seems to lose that part but I have to buy this entire set of pieces every time.	positive
I had the original band for my watch that I wore every single day, for about 10 years (not an exaggeration), before it finally broke. This one lasted less than a year with limited use since I now only wear it for field work. It caught once on some metal I beams and it tore right off. Also installing this thing was ridiculous, it took about 30 minutes fumbling with the pins.	negative
I've owned other hydro flask products and love their proprietary coating but this mug is misleading and comes in a sort of rubber sheath around the metal cup. I wouldn't complain except you can pull the rubber away from the cup near the handle bringing doubts of long term life to this product.	positive
:3 got it for my friend and its perfect	positive
1st order: I Love love love product dark circles diminished while eye patch hydrates & cools. BUT 2nd & 3rd order packaging slightly off from 1st order AND hell pads would not adhere to skin. Very Disappointed.	negative
Mava Sports Knee Braces are made of high quality material that gave my knees a good feel of compression. It is important to measure your leg to get the correct size. The braces came in nice, easy to open packaging. I found the Velcro straps to be a little shorter than I would like them. However, that did not effect their performance. I trail walk 6 miles a day and find them comfortable enough to forget I am wearing them.	positive
I was not given the correct product...Would prefer to have what I paid for instead of what looks like an accident. I see that there is no return policy, however, I need to either be refunded or given the correct products. Will update the review if issue is corrected	negative
I wanted to enjoy this app but always running into advertisements. I deleted.	negative
Color not as described	negative
Can't get the smaller size so they send you a tool to remove links to make it fit. Too much screwing around.	negative
The plastic lid through which the plunger rod passes cracked within a week. For a few pennies of plastic, gussets on the underside of the lid would have provided the necessary support to prevent the crack. I would definitely not buy this again.	negative
Will not take grounded plug. Did not use outdoors	negative
I love the glasses and had the glasses for more then a month before they broke.	negative
We are finishing up our second box of 50, and really like these bags. They are intended for compostable kitchen waste and have served that purpose quite well for us. We have also used them for normal household waste and sent them off with the trash collectors. At lease we are not contributing a non-biodegradable bag along with the rest of the trash.	positive
I like it. Rides down though, like the opposite of wedgie-shorts. Have to keep pulling them up. Covers my muffin top but doesn't restrain it. Maybe I could have done with a smaller size but they are comfortable and have pockets.	positive
Fabulous magnets! Sleek design and surprisingly strong! Highly recommend.	positive
perfect size for a child, but too small for adults. towels came dirty.	negative
It's very heavy, but works great	positive
Really didn't like some of the story twists, but we'll see what happens next season. Still impressed by guest actors talent though.	positive
I have cataracts. The glasses are a great aid in protecting my eyes from sunlight. Thanks so much for this great product.	positive
Pockets! Love the pockets! Is a little heavier material than I expected for summer, but it's beautiful!	positive
Overall good quality and keeps food and cans cold. Wish it had some outside pockets or something to store snacks.	positive
Sometimes the string won't retract.	negative
LOVE LOVE these gloves. Lightweight cool and feel great. Not water proof so be careful but the dry extremely fast	positive
I like the product overall except the magnetic phone car mount does not fully stick on my dashboard other than that i think ots good quality.	positive
When movies feel boring to you, watch Jumanji. Jumanji it an experience that needs to be experienced	positive
I really like this lid. It fits perfectly. The size of the drinking hole is just what I was expecting.	positive
these were actually too small but we will keep them, who knows when we can use them.	positive
Too large for my needs	negative
Nice case but it seems a little 'loose' although the phone has stayed in it so far.	positive
Very very very small pot...	negative
My son loves this reel. It’s his second rod for inshore and freshwater fishing. Smooth.	positive
Smells good but not as good as other sandalwood I've had before it's just okay	positive
Beautiful color and dress design. Love the fit and the length for hubby! A little on the thin side though.	positive
This cover does not protect the camera lense as previously mentioned. Brand new phone is now damaged over a design defect.	negative
After allowing the pillows to breathe and putting In the dryer, I laid down for a good nights sleep that didn’t happen. This pillow is so firm it’s almost brick-like.	negative
So far my son really likes this Headset!	positive
Epic adventure - expertly written and researched.	positive
tore immediately when my student placed there fingers in the grippers	negative
It's great to have the charging ports in a surge protector. great idea!	positive
Did not need. Sent back.	negative
I really like this clock although it's not as large as I had expected even though it's the size as described. It doesn't show very well on a darker wall, as you night imagine, but it is nicely made and looks great!	positive
Horrible product. Never held air. We kept it in the package past the return date so we lost our money.	negative
When I wash got little bit small	negative
It's a Saturday night and I had no where to go and have caught up on all the cable shows I've usually watch, so I opened up Prime and this movie was recommended. Why? I don't know! This was horrible acting. My ears liked the music because it sound like the 90's, which was my favorite decade. I laughed at the end when they showed the packing up boxes, simply because there was no Amazon boxes back then!	negative
Beautiful Handcrafted notebook! Will definitely come back for another one. The quality is very good. I have been wanting one for a long time. I found it here on Amazon and came across this seller and I am so happy with it. I highly recommend it,for anyone looking for a special gift with a reasonable price its great!	positive
Does not look like shown in person.	negative
Works great for my senior rabbit who has become a little messy in her later years.	positive
They're cute but REALLY thin, can't use after they spit up 1 time	negative
The light effect is not that good. Not worth the price of the item. Poorly made	negative
My phone is cracked after using this it doesn't protect your phone that much	positive
Rusted after one hand wash and air dry. Disappointed	negative
This was a prime item and it didnt arrive on time. That was disappointing as I was Waiting on this to pair with a birthday gift crayons light up black board. Which also came late.	positive
If you have perfect hair this may work for you. However, for my girls with already color treated hair, or slightly damaged hair this will not work. It doesn't leave your hair smooth at all. It straightens but doesn't' have the technology to smooth it out or prevent flyaways. Also my hair would get stuck on the sides of it. Save yourself the money.	negative
If you enjoyed 1 & 2, you will enjoy this final with the same characters, comedy, and music. This is one of those types of movies that provide a great break from the craziness of your day.	positive
It looks cool, and it does throw sparks, but requires a LOT of work. And a tiny piece of sharp metal isn't the most comfortable thing to have to grip for any extended period. Especially in any inclement weather. Just make things easier on yourself and wear a Ferro rod and striker, or use the 90° spine on your knife. This might help in a pinch, but just prepare yourself to drop some F-bombs.	negative
This product is lightweight enough for our older toddler to put it on the potty herself. One drawback is that urine sometimes gets trapped under the rim and then ends up on the big potty seat when the small one is lifted.	positive
Works great for my home brew kegs. I looked online to see all parts I needed to make my own set up.	positive
Has been helping with toe nail fungus where other specifically toe nail fungus products have failed.	positive
Book arrived in horrible condition with missing pages and all bent/crumbled	negative
Good little filter, my one grip is that the stem isn't sturdy - so at times the filter falls down when positioning it.	positive
I bought these because I work on my feet 13 hours a day. I couldn't stand them after a few hours. Too tight! I guess the compression is just too much. I am 5'2 and 125 lbs. I wouldn't recommend them for what I need them for. I have neuropathy in my legs and feet.	negative
I loved the JVC Gummy earbuds and was sad when I could no longer find them in stores. I really dislike the kind where you have to stick the rubber insert into your ear, but that seems to be all that is sold these days. So, I was happy I found these on Amazon and thought I'd give this one a try. Good sound quality, but I did knock a star off because, unlike other reviewers, the little stick out parts do bother my ear.	positive
I am in love with these shoes. The toe box is very different yet makes sense to let your toes spread. They make you want to jump for joy/	positive
I didn’t have an option to put no stars. But these seeds will not grow. Don’t waste your money. Wish I would be refunded or get sent a new pack of seeds or something else.... I am very unsatisfied and unhappy.	negative
Beautiful form fitting dress though it still hides my small post baby bump. I did need to have it altered to my height, it needed the zipper moved up to hide the back of my bra and keep the sleeves on my shoulders. Other than that..... perfect.	positive
Very cute & the fur is very soft but there was definitely a complete struggle trying to put this on the steering wheel. At first it seem as though it was too small. Took me & a friend to install it.	positive
Changed batteries but the bracelet still didn’t work	negative
Cool case. Feels very protective. My son wants one now.	positive
At first this product worked wonderfully. After about 4 months, it stopped working at all. Had my mechanic check the wiring and everything was fine. The fan itself just died.	negative
This works very well as a fitness tracker and as a golf GPS it has features that I will never use but it gives me the option. I like only wearing one item when I golf.	positive
I used these for the simplest of electronics task. After two minutes of them connected, the wire started to get too hot and melt the outer plastic. The black and red actually bonded together.	negative
my daughter loved this dress!	positive
I recommend it. It looks great; however, my only complaint was the link remover tool. Both pins broke within a few minutes, so I ended up having to purchase a better quality one from Amazon. The actual appearance of the silver band is really nice, though! I really wanted something to make my apple watch look more professional for my office job, and this 100% did the trick!	positive
You get bang for your buck with this box set. Some errors throughout the various stories. Annoying more than anything. Couple stories were better than the others. Definitely worth a read.	positive
Has a very weird aftertaste	negative
Come on....how can you go wrong with original AC Delco parts. They always work great.	positive
Much bigger than I was expecting, but the bride LOVED it for her bachelorette party!	positive
Loved these. They are a little difficult to inflate at first but once you get the hang of it they're not bad. We bought a few and bring them out when the kids have friends over for movies and we don't have enough room on the couch	positive
They fit my young children perfectly! They are a bit to small for my adult face. As I peered through the lenses under water it seemed as if I was wearing someone’s prescription lenses. The children did not mention this but it made it awkward for me. I haven’t used them much personally as a result but they do every day.	positive
It is body friendly, and no after effects.	positive
Burns rice even with proper portion and makes my rice taste weird.	negative
Very nice belt and well made.	positive
The curve does not cover the phone	negative
It smells great, but it’s just a bin of loose coffee grinds. Wasn’t expecting that.	negative
At low/medium volume and phone at full volume you get decent quality. But it broke after maybe 2 mo this and now the static from it on any radio frequency completely drowns out any music	negative
Daughter seems to like it. Although I read reviews about it being small, the size really blew my mind. I fee like it is more like doll bookshelf than a child's, that is how small it is. Do not feel like searching anymore, but I might still return. Will see how much she actually interacts with it.	negative
I bout 3lb for this bean. I did medium roasting ( i stopped roasting during the first crack because i don't like a dark roasting) with this bean. I pour over a day after (for degassing) the roasting with chemex and the taste feature is very citrus and clean.(maybe becuase of chemex filter) I don't taste any bitterness and i think it has a medium body. good to try it.	positive
Slow to get here, a bit subjective on letter mix and have a nuisance level memory if they get bent making it necessary to exercise some real care using them.	negative
This item came damage, I returned them but have not gotten my credit!	positive
Both were dried out. Could barely get anything out of the pencils. Had to use an alternative.	negative
I love these slippers only reason I’m giving them 4 stars is because the soles are really thin. I was expecting them to be a little thicker. They fit well and are super comfy.	positive
The book arrived, not as advertised. When I requested a refund I was charged a 10% restocking fee and shipping. Not the best third party seller.	negative
A little time consuming putting together. Wasn’t as sturdy as I expected until I filled with shoes, seems to be fine now. Fast shipping.	positive
I have been using this while traveling and it's been pretty convenient. Good sound quality and sturdy. Easy to connect as well.	positive
Keeps popping off the fitbit, the spring that connects to fitbit keeps on popping out and fitbit consequential falls off wrist.	negative
Tried this product for the first time as I was attempting to use it to strengthen my nails and harden them against cracking. So far it’s working. I’ll keep using it. Seems to be very good quality. I recommend it	positive
big and goofy towards the leg, not a young man's style. try goodthreads chino	negative
Loved the material and size but they kind of look like the print of rock is from a 3D printer and not like actual stone	negative
I like the different options for the front light. You can use either the single large light or the smaller side lights or all three at once.	positive
Great sander but mine Is missing the dust collection system, it wasn’t included	negative
wears out after a few uses	negative
The faucet is well functioning but the it is overpriced by about $100.	positive
Doesn't do anything. I even take two or three and still nothing.	negative
these fit my vacuum great! went by photo because out model was in target but not listed anywhere. Thank you	positive
From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.	negative
Pretty good but I feel like it made my screen darker	positive
I’ve used this after the gym for a few days. It helped to tighten my abdomen while I am watching TV from my house. My muscle and abs are sore like been doing a lot of crunches workout . So excited it works . Will be getting these for gifts as well !!!	positive
Container was sealed but only half full very disappointed!	negative
I am interested to know how PTSD can impact lives and I found this book added to my thoughts. There was just a bit too much sex in the book, but it was the author’s intention that it served a purpose to the plot, not just for the sake of sex alone.	positive
Easy to use, stays in place with mask underneath, and easy to clean. Simple but useful!	positive
Eyes don't glow very well. Product came in good condition.	positive
This candle smells very floral. Not woodsy or muskie at all like the description. The jar is very beautiful and of good quality the wood wick very nice. This is not at all the smell I was looking for but if you are into floral perfume smells this is for you. If I had to describe the smell I would say it is like grandma's white diamonds perfume.	negative
Horrible horrible!! I paid $10.99 for balloons that instantly popped when inflated. The ones that did stay inflated did not hold helium at all. Dropped to the ground an hour later. I never was soo disappointed with balloons till today. The kids were not happy at all . They could not even play with the balloons because they would just deflate or pop. Garbage. Not a happy customer at all. Please do not bother to waist your money.	negative
If your dog scratches a lot and you’ve tried everything this is the answer. I buy it as gifts for all my friends!	positive
Good product, but 1 it does not fit one of the cast iron pan handles and 2 the heat still came throught	negative
It was easy to cut on my Cricut machine but when I went to weed it, the vinyl was extremely sticky to the touch on the front (the camo printed side). It transferred well to the rash guard i used it on. I tried several ways to remove the stickiness but nothing worked. I made the shirt at the end of March 2019 and it is still sticky.	negative
The liquid is very thick! You have to chase it with water... Otherwise, they give you plenty of energy, too!	positive
It skidded all over my front foyer, not nonstick as described. My dog loved the shag, but I will be replacing with with a rug with a more rubberized backing.	negative
Was missing parts which is a little dangerous when riding the bicycle. Not the most comfortable.	negative
Came early only good thing I got 10 of 12 and the 10 I got all the same size. There supposed to be 12 different sizes cuz it's ordered as 12 and I only got 10 of the 12 so I got robbed two and then it's all the same it's number 20	negative
the balloon they are in is green its discolored. mickey face is horrible looks really bad Minnie has the wrong colors on her face am very disappointed. asked seller for a replacement that is not so horrible or my money back	negative
Recieved product in a timely manner. I still have ink in my printer, have not used the new product as of today.	positive
Helped with my dry scalp and itchiness	positive
I help with landscaping and my hands have gotten rough from not wearing protection. This really helps me do more work and much faster. This is made out of washable materials and it dries quickly	positive
I order this item beginning of January and did not received this yet. Was suppose to be delivery on January 10th and today is February 25th and still nothing .	negative
I disliked the pinion seal. It was the wrong size. That sucked. I got to install the yolk twice!! Runing the first crush ring, one time use they are. Got no support from seller or manufacturer. So no, buy a higher end kit... or do it twice and pay more any way. Your call.	negative
Makes you feel better. Worked for my stomach flu	positive
very good shirts to wear under my uniform much more comfortable than the ones I usually get from the exchange.	positive
Not a bad charger but isn’t like a fast charger that comes with most phones. It feels very light in an inexpensive way but for the price I think it’s not bad. Being able to lay your device horizontally and also get a charge is a bonus.	positive
super hard to assemble. bars keep falling a part, do not buy this is totally wasted of many and couldn't returned because it brakes while trying to put the bars together.	negative
wish the stickers were bigger.. also they come in a sheet not individual.	positive
Looks great and works well.	positive
I used these heat shrink connectors for my outdoor low voltage lighting and it works great. This butt crimp connectors is very easy to work with and the connection is strong and tight. Price is lower than the big box stores and 210 pcs should last me quite a while.	positive
This headphone has good sound quality and good connection with the wire. It also fits tightly on the head, which blocks a lot of noise and makes the headphone secure. However, sometimes I feel it fits too tight.	positive
Good to have a great meal plan with this Ketogenic Instant Pot Cookbook. I always enjoy discovering new fabulous of Keto recipes which I enjoy this diet most.	positive
2 flushes then it is gone. Horrible product	negative
Love the dress, very stretchy though. I got the 4/6 Print 1 and the actual dress tag on the inside of the dress says medium. Kinda swaying between needing this or the small, which must be the 0/2 size.	positive
Great story. Well written	positive
Love this case. I was specifically looking for a case that would keep the pencil handy and safe. The only problem I have noticed so far is that the pencil will not stand in the small circles when the case is propped, but that isn’t a big deal for me. Fits my 6th Gen with no problems or complaints.	positive
Good quality. It is well made for the price. I would buy again.	positive
Waste of money & hurt my fur babies	negative
wrong order thanks for nothing	negative
I really think they are very cheap they were bought for a gift. I don't think they will last a day. I will see on Christmas day if they like them	negative
The Downton Abbey story has something for everyone of every age. We loved watching the DVDs.	positive
If the side button worked it would have been a good replacement for my old cover, however the side button barely works. The only way to get it to function is to press it with a pen or thumbnail. I had to order a different case as Amazon tells me this is not returnable. If I had known that I would never have purchased it	negative
I never thought I'd be able to apply the word 'stale' to bacon, but now I can. I decided to try the maple bacon jerky because the wonderful sriracha bacon jerky I found was a bit spicy for me. I was seriously disappointed, though. While it tastes like sugar, it doesn't taste of maple. It's limp and unappetizing, and kind of like chewing cardboard.	negative
Been waiting months to recieve this order... still waiting! I have tried to reach out to them but they do not respond.	negative
My 10 month old hated this toy. I bought it because I thought it would be good for the plane ride. I stuck it to the table in front of me, and my baby got so mad that she couldn't pull it off the table that she cried.	negative
These are NOT rubber. These are useless. They break after holding the hair for 2-3 minutes. Waste of money and too much of a hassle to return.	negative
The books arrived, but the case was already destroyed when it arrived. Disappointing.	negative
it is hard to put the lid on. you have to seal each corner. also, one container broke during the first use	negative
The cover feels quite nice, not too heavy my only minor issue is that the colour is not as shown on the pics (at least for me who ordered the black one) it's more a greyish colour then black.	positive
They put this beside their bed. Was soft on the feet	positive
MUCH BETTER than the Chinese version. SOLID PLATFORM; SECURE FITTING WHEELS	positive
Don't bother reading this book. If you have followed the news over the last year you've pretty much learned much of what it has to say. The book becomes much less fly on the wall after February 2017, when I think Wolff lost access to the White House. The big revelation is that Trump probably never really wanted to be President and that we should be thanking God that Bannon's downfall has begun. But this is not going to be the book of the Trump administration. Go read something beautiful.	negative
The hat looks really nice and well made; unfortunately, it was very snug and I have a normal size head. After a few minutes of wearing, it gave me marks and a huge headache. Be alarmed when purchasing these hats.	negative
Beautiful cover with great quality... will definitely order again.	positive
This plant came packaged so nicely! the vase was wrapped in bubble wrap so there was no damages. The actual bamboo plant came with a jelly around the roots, in a bag so it stayed fresh! I just followed the instructions and it's beautiful! Just make sure you have a few pebbles or something small to help it stand up, it won't stand on its own in the vase! Beautiful!	positive
These things are super hecking soft. Your feet like sink in and they don’t slide or anything. Real good	positive
Love it. Can't even tell I have a screen protector on.	positive
Arrived fast and was inexpensive.	positive
It is not as sturdy as I thought	positive
Really uncomfortable on the ball of the foot	negative
This thing is pretty thick. The only way my boyfriend wanted to wear it was if he cut out the extra flap. Oops, next time I won't get Extra Capacity. Leather quality felt nice.	positive
I have enjoyed this shirt so very much	positive
My daughter loves LOL dolls but guys, this is junk. I assumed it would be similar to the size of the dolls, because that makes sense. Nope, it's large, hard plastic and came with 3 tiny accessories that were not fun to open. It's just junk.	negative
Good but small for price	positive
It would be good if not for an annoying problem with the volume As other reviewer note the volume goes from low to high abruptly, sometimes I have to put it very low because if try to raise it turns it very loud So I guess there's a problem with quality control somehow Better avoid the radio and look other alternative	negative
These things are great! Got them as stocking stuffers for a 2 and 4 year old and they loved them and honestly so did I! Shaped them into lots of things then into the final product and let set.	positive
horrible. i basically payed $30 for a box and some glue. the pads didn’t adhere, the glue sucked, and nothing in general worked. i thought it had been my lack of experience, but i tried multiple times following the instructions word by word and nothing happened except for watering eyes.	negative
I’m not a snorkel kind of girl so I really didn’t think it would be so different than swim goggles. I guess it is because this didn’t work at all for my swim goggles. After the fact I read the back and it states it’s not for swim goggles. Wish they would put that in the description.	negative
good price-couple bristles or so will come out. Still cheaper than oem	positive
It made my hair limp and did not add volume. My friend loves it and recommended it, but it simply didn't work for me.	negative
This was purchase not too long ago and it’s the worst case I’ve had, it looked so old and gross the paints peeling and chipping I would like a refund	negative
Missing all hooks and hardware, plus no directions so haven't been able to install!	negative
"I was so excited to get this product and was thankful it came fast. But, when I opened it up the pads themselves have a yellow stain, then I noticed the edge of the container as well as the ""safety seal"" was covered in filth. I will let you know if the seller replaces this expensive item!"	negative
Bought this as a gift and the lettering on the heart is rubbed off in spots can't give this as a gift now. What a royal waste of money! Now I have to go out and try to find a new gift in 4 days. So disappointed and angry!	negative
Good! Wanted to buy i pen but it was just too expensive. So I bought alternative pen. It works well. :)	positive
There’s no screws in the box???? I looked at product description again....they should be included....	negative
Pricey but well made tool.	positive
Works great and doesn’t clog. It leaks a little bit here and there but it’s worth it.	positive
Was a little confusing to use it at first. Doesn't seem to fit snugly around my shoulder once the liquid has frozen.	negative
It’s the Quality we are used to with Pelican. Very solid and fits great. The magnetic vent clip/stand is a nice touch. I was looking for another Magpul case for my new phone but they don’t make one for the newer iPhones yet. I’m glad I stumbled across this one.	positive
These boots are perfect !! Great Buy	positive
I now have 4 of these 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾. It will keep cool or cold liquid cooler then outside temperature for approximately 1-1/2 - 2 hours; The drink valve can be closed or open. Closed no flow, and open it will flow if squeezed. I have not had any trouble with mold in the valve described in some of the other posts. I also like the color options available. I highly recommend	positive
Good for any Totoro fan. Pens fit in exactly as depicted.	positive
Ridiculously soft. Haven't washed yet. Better than expected.	positive
The product never worked, not even for a brief moment. It wouldn't stay on long enough to configure.	negative
This dress is beautiful. I love it.	positive
never received the item	negative
We hid these outside in Easter.	positive
I disliked the product due to how flat the pillows were, I had to question whether there was filling of any kind in them. I give it two stars because the material did feel cool as advertised.	negative
Great if it’s just a small amount of liquid sitting on fabric for a short amount of time, but if a large amount of liquid sits on this for 4hours or more (I bought this for my senior dog to try to protect the bedding while I’m at work for 8 hours) is will leak through.	negative
Used it for a day and it broke.	negative
Wouldn't buy again. Doesn't fit a corolla 2016 at all. Now it's stuck in there permanently I think, had to cut down to size which makes it lose some of it's appeal.	negative
Space legs, nuff said, wifey says they are a little small.	positive
Loved them, great quality and perfect for my ceiling fan.	positive
Actually made my heel hurt more, felt better without it after testing it on different trial days	negative
While the ring is steel, the base is plastic and there is nothing in the description that says it is. Just says powder coated black. Hope they hold up...	negative
The material was not as sturdy as it could have been, but it suits ots purpose.	positive
Good for starting hand-washing. Smells maybe a tiny bit off, not bad but not great either. It doesn't seem to leave a smell on the hands so it doesn't bother us. My daughter (20 months old) likes to push the pump down herself - just be careful because it's easy to make a big mess!	positive
The mirror and the wood surface are at the same level. The mirror can easily be scratch, should be recessed a bit. Otherwise nicely done.	positive
Bought 2, 1 froze up after 3 months	negative
I love the mascara, but the primer did not work for me. It gave me raccoon eyes shortly after application.	negative
Rough. I wouldn’t buy again.	negative
Used 3 times and broke	negative
My son says they are very comfortable and easy to put on and take off	positive
Sturdy, easy to assemble, taller than most. Looks great!	positive
This product ruined my new Kindle. I am left with big round circles in the middle of my screen even after removing the screen protector. I cannot remove them and my kindle screen is an ugly sight. Buyer beware. This is a horrible product.	negative
item never came the first time, I really wanted it, so I purchased again. I like the size, it is extremely small. I shot fifty rounds of .22 LR subsonic ammo at 27 yards and this thing was pretty much toast. Maybe I got a dud, who knows.	negative
The shipment was incomplete (NO BASES SENT). I contacted the seller and DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. I am returning them and purchasing locally.	negative
Perfect as it says, cold or hot works both ways!	positive
nice shoe and product material, just to narrow for me	positive
Not comfortable to sit on.	negative
Great gift for my nephew who recently had someone accidentally pickup his luggage at baggage claim then intentionally take his expensive shoes and pants before returning it two weeks later.	positive
I know you only get what you paid for, but I bought these after carefully reading through the reviews here. I just feel the sound quality is bad. The sound snaps out very often and I need to turn off and back on again for them to work. That's kind of frustrating.	negative
"I am also a ""history buff"" and was very disappointed to find that what should have been interesting, suspenseful and informative came across as nothing more than a soap opera writ large. I blame the director/producer: too much acting for the sake of acting rather than acting for the sake of giving us an accurate account of what transpired. If only someone had said ""let's make this like a documentary about the 37 days."""	negative
The pinch pleats on this are awful. No where near the picture. I’ve had a few comforters like this and this one is the worst I’ve gotten. There’s also a lot of wrinkles that won’t come out. 2 stars because the size is accurate and I got the right color.	negative
Ran very small. I am a size 14 I purchased a xxl and it was still very small. I returned the item for size and material. It was a very weird plastic material.	negative
Its not good for me.	negative
This is a functional fitness tracker that friend referred to me. It has more functions than I expected. This fitness tracker has Heart Rate Monitor with color screen, it can also link to my iPhone and it is very similar to the more expensive Fitbit my wife have. I have worn it in swimming and in shower with no problems at all. I like it especially it is much cheaper than Fitbit with similar function. Highly recommended.	positive
Good quality, sadly design was not distributed throughout the band and only shows flowers at the end with black solidly showing predominantly, unlike the picture which shows design throughout the band.	negative
First off these bulbs are definitely brighter but are actually almost useless at night since they seem aimed very high and not on the road. Adjusting my lamps down then makes my high beams useless, they seem to be manufactured for all uses not totally vehicle specific in which each lamp is clocked differently. Not sure if im going to try cutting the lamp tab to get it more useable or just toss them. Beware when you buy these that they may not light the road properly.	negative
Bought this for my mom because she loves Coca Cola collectibles! She loves it.	positive
"It looks great and is reasonably well made. But I'm sending it back for three reasons. It smells like mold. The zipper is sewn in a way that the edge of zipper gets caught in the teeth as you zip it up. Super annoying. Strap is sadly too short. I guess I fall into the ""particularly burly"" category, as the product description cautions. I'm 5ft 9in and 185 lbs. Worn across the body the bag is at the level of my stomach."	negative
I really enjoyed this product, but once I took it off for about a week, then went to put it on again, it stopped working. I tried several times to recharge the battery, but it seemed it died. I only had this product a couple of months. No literature came with the product that explained what could have possibly happened. I think the battery lost charge and then that was it! Very disappointing.	negative
Excellent read, intrigue suspense, whole lot of drama, betrayal, spiteful, confusion, revenge, and a whole lot of healing. I could not put this book down. Love the storyline but a little disappointed in the ending. Definite recommend.	positive
just ordered. try to open two small cans of beans. I lock it on there and the first thing it does is fall off. It struggled to maintain the track and to open the cans. at one point it was not able to make any forward progress and I had to take it off and put on again many times. It did not lift the lid at the end. very disappointed. It worked the same as the $3 from the grocery store. I doubt it will last.	negative
I received a used product that has black smudges on all the buttons. I will be returning this product.	negative
These socks are nice and colorful but I misread the title and thought these were in men’s sizes in which I wear a 10, so these fit smaller than expected since I am a man and these are women sizes. But I still wear them.	positive
You have to subscribe to a paid TV networking i.e. DirecTV dish TV or cable TV Do use it	negative
I can't give this product a one star because when it was working it was great! We've had it less then 2yrs and now it surges and blows the circuit. Tried different plugs and same. So I spent 8hrs flipping the breaker every 15min so my party would have smoked meat to enjoy. Super sad that the smoker had a 4.5 star review when I bought it, but not surprisingly thi se it reduced.	negative
This is a rip-off. Unstable pieces of cheap metal with a few screws and wing nuts. In addition to that, pain in the rear end to install. Definitely would buy again. Stars for quick shipping only.	negative
My daughter loved this pillow... She already named it as Jungle pillow... Quality is too good perfect size for toddlers... And am very happy with the purchase	positive
Did not fit properly, even after I cut it. Edge was too floppy to fit in small crack of gap. A waste for me.	negative
Pretty good one. It's my wife's. She likes it. Could be slightly less smooth, since no one likes to drop a slippery phone in a slippery vase. Overall: Good	positive
The protector did not adhere to the screen completely with a case which impeded the use of the touch screen. If it is used without a protective case it worked great.	negative
Horrible product. Brome 2 days after I received and only used it 2 or 3 times.	negative
Theres nothing I liked about it. Did not do the job. I changed my rating from 1 to 5 stars because of the way the company responded to my first review.	positive
Holds umbrella well in strong wind, and wheels help maneuver the umbrella	positive
So I bought this and it was very difficult to find the driver for it. Once I downloaded it, it worked fine but it runs a background task all the time my computer is on even when I'm not using it. Makes me worried that it's malware. They could've made a driver that doesn't do that. Use with caution.	negative
I am a small the first one did not fit this one I got a xlarge it did not fit right do not like it at all like to return it	negative
This is a neat story, and when you read about the author at the end of the book, it makes the story even more meaningful. It is cute how the dragon helps his mom.	positive
It's nice just really really small.	negative
Well first there was a mistake on the phone number but they quickly sent me a new one. But then the glitter fell off so I glued it back on but it fell off again. Then the other day the whole thing broke off the tag and it's no longer usable. Which isn't good if the dog got lost. Price wise it's not a big deal but the time it's gonna take me to order another one is a hassle.	negative
Complete failure for me. Made at least 3 attempts before giving up. Ended up with runny, uncooked eggs.	negative
How can anyone write so many words and say nothing? It was an interesting concept of two families living in the same house more than a hundred years apart, but there should have been a better connection.	negative
"OMG! This is magical! It fits me so damn good! I am 5'6"", 150lbs, a little on the chunky side (for now lol) and it hugs my curves so great! I love how good it feels and fits."	positive
Very well made product. These come in very handy! Will definitely purchase again!	positive
Cute key set, but honestly, I was looking for something bigger. When I pulled them out of the bag, I felt like I was going to bust the keys. They are very tiny. I had to return them and get bigger sturdier keys.	positive
Can't heat the room if weather is under 55 and in any weather condition the heater couldn't heat above 72	negative
Wanted to like these and use in my car to freshen things up but they became overpowering even on the lowest setting and made the car smell like a cheap perfume. Won't be getting these again.	negative
EMPTY PACKAGE ARRIVED	negative
and this bag was perfect for my makeup and a few personal hygiene essentials .	positive
It came as spected but doesnt work on beats studio 3 waste of money	negative
Purchased this in 2016 and used it since purchase. Now the red ball seems stripped and it does not work. This does not seem right for such an expensive item! Would be better off getting cheaper option it these items don't last more than a few years! Disappointing.	negative
Came with no instructions and by the time I got it, I had almost forgotten I ordered it. It does appear to work though.	negative
Product never showed up!!!	negative
I brought them as a gift for my father in law he loved them thank you so very much. He is very hard to buy for so if he loves them they must be the real deal.	positive
I tried this out but had low expectations based on reviews that said it only stays on a couple of days. I’ve had it on for a week now & it looks as great as it did when it first went on. I love the color as well. Very pleased overall.	positive
I don't think I paid much attention to dimensions because it's significantly smaller than what I was expecting. But, it works great. I love it for soups for uniform cutting.	positive
It doesn't cook evenly and makes an annoying beep when it's done toasting.	negative
My 4C hair absolutely loves this moisturizer. This is the only one that I use to keep my hair moisturized!	positive
Item didn’t have one piece of bubble wrap or anything to cushion the canister. Very disappointed in the poor customer service	negative
Difficult to put on. Doesnt protect well. Takes a long time to put on. Just buy the regular glass screen protectors that you stick on. The method of putting these on is so unnecessary.	negative
Tip broke after 2 uses	negative
Does NOT fit Bose wireless buds unlike most reviews. Opening is far too small and does not bend to fit cord. Broke one trying to get it to fit so cannot return.	negative
My new cat is finicky, but through this little sampler, I discovered his favorites (pate)	positive
The mirror was easy to install, nice looking and seems sturdy however the distortion on the 10X magnifying side is very bad. The reason I bought it was to put make up on without having to wear my glasses and it is basically unusable for that purpose. I will be replacing it and putting in a spare bathroom.	negative
Soft material and smooth to touch but HOT! This material is not cotton and it retains heat in night and makes you sweat. I am not a hot or sweaty person, but I hate theses sheets. Even with a light blanket and AC on, the sheets don’t breathe and make my legs sweat! We went back to only using 100% cotton sheets and are much happier and more comfortable!	negative
This razor does it's job. It's not as powerful as I'd hoped but it does what it's supposed to do.	positive
I'd like to watch this but the picture is so jerky that i can not look at it for an hour. Don't know if the actual movie is good or not.	negative
Wrong product was sent! What a waste of my time!	negative
Not sure why I got this book; maybe the story about a girl trying to navigate her older sister’s death sounded interesting? But I think it must be a YA book and it just felt too simplistic.	negative
So flimsy. This would only hold up with a dishtowel or small bath towel. No way holds a pool towel. Way overpriced. Two stars for their return policy. My item had already been returned once.	negative
for most of the things when asked to play ...here is sample and goes on silent	negative
Like a thick saltine, but more dense. Delicious. I have an elderly friend who used to live in Alaska that told me about them, he said they would last forever, and that they are the modern equivalent of hard tack.	positive
Very thin, not horrible, but not spectacular	negative
Comfy seat. Wish it was longer to better fit my car seat.	positive
Doesn’t work likes supposed to. Too big...	negative
My cat loves this pad! She hardly gets off it	positive
Works but not as nice to turn and use to tighten.	positive
I have a pixel Android phone and I can get charges from this for at least 3 days, this bank is powerful, looks elegant very good quality but the most important it works the way it should very surprised with the quality.	positive
I like this gift because it's not big. It was a perfect gift for my 9 year old daughter.	positive
Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller	negative
Wow, who knew my water, tea and coffee could taste so much better!	positive
This was a great value and the #4 is perfect for the original Glock 43. I also have the #2 for my Taurus Spectrum.	positive
Bought the 50 ft cord July 28. Only used ONCE since unboxing. Not working on Sept 15. Lines, flashing and flickering on the screen. Too late to return. Money wasted.	negative
The package looks small for the price, but there are of ton of little modeling skulls in there.	positive
I assumed that the wall art would be the same as displayed on the product images; however, I have found out that it is actually not as wide as the image above, the product description does list the measurements more accurately. The measurements; however, do not reflect the sample image used above.	negative
Works great! They are very sticky for a project my child was working on.	positive
Seems to be helping to lose weight	positive
Cute and comfortable. But skip, I would pay a little more for a better quality band. I’ve only had it for a a week or two and it’s already peeling. Super bummed.	negative
Tried everything I could think of with different TVs and computers, could not get it to work	negative
If you like to hate the bad guy but can’t wait to see what he’s up to next, this set will keep you up at night. Great read.	positive
I bought this since my middle seat does not have a headrest to attach a carseat mirror. I was able to put it on one of the side headrests and could angle it to see my baby in the middle seat. Unfortunately after just a few weeks, I can no longer adjust the mirror because it's completely loose and does not stay in a position except completely facing down.	negative
Foot feels soft, but has not begun to peel. Entering Week 2. Will alter once completed. Took awhile but definitely worth the wait	negative
Very flat. I had a Coconut Bliss pillow but wanted something king size and hoped this would work for a lower cost. It is nothing like the nicer pillows. I dont recommend.	negative
The box was crushed. I will avoid buying from this seller on Amazon again when buying. Every other pop I have ordered has came in protected with bubble wrap and air packets - not this one, it was just thrown in a box and shipped. I accept the possibility of slight box damage but this one looked like it had been sat on and the shipping box was perfect - meaning it was probably crushed at the seller.	negative
It was exactly what we needed. Thanks.	positive
I misunderstood description. Says it's not backwards, I thought they meant final product was not backwards!!! Nope! Mold isnt reversed so the letters come out backwards. Ordering another one now. Very disappointed!!	negative
Smells very strongly of stale perfume. The smell would linger for days. Had to throw away.	negative
Great product and fast delivery. Will definitely shop again.	positive
I'm glad I spent a little more for this cute retro toaster. Works great on bagels too. It has a lifter so you can get your toast out easier. I love mine!	positive
Zero retention = Sitting down the wrong way will cause your magazine to get pushed up/out	negative
Archipelago is a quality product, and this Verbena/Basil scent is out of this world. It is not floral or perfumey, rather botanical - thus refreshing for the whole house, and enhancing for the kitchen, too.	positive
I cannot comment on this item as I will have to return it; one of the 2 bottle received expired 6 months ago. The other had about 8 months remaining before expiration.	negative
Ive ran 'em for almost 2 years and finally made a review. They're still working great. No suspension parts have needed replaced, and they give good stance. Ove posted some before and after pics with this.	positive
What I was looking for! Just a little bigger than I wanted for my collection.	positive
So far so good. Trying to keep the leg cramps at bay and this was suggested.	positive
this wax actually holds your hair in place unlike a lot of waxes out there. i bought this because i was looking for a wax that would last my work day and google recommended it. I dont like using a lot of product and with this stuff you dont really need too to get a decent hold that will last	positive
I liked the weight and resistance when struck.	positive
I’m really happy with this! The material is super soft and comfortable. It’s a compression shirt so it runs small- I’m normally a woman Medium/Large pending the fit- I order this in a Men’s Large and it’s perfect. It did take a long time to ship.	positive
Bought as a gift for my friend he loves it. I kinda wanted to keep it for myself, but I already have one	positive
Nice product. I was initially disappointed that it was not embroidered, but it is a quality cover.	positive
Perfect for my cold hands on my desk!	positive
Hose does not come with the cover as it shows in the picture. You can tell its poor quality the moment you touch it. Does not clip into heads just pushes in, prone to coming off	negative
Awww man these things are great!!! I used them in the kitchen, the bathroom and closet door in my bedroom. I didn't know what to expect but this was a really great idea for hooks! Really easy to use and strong adhesive.	positive
Good hold & like that it is natural ingredients.	positive
I bought this book for my grand daughter, it brought back so many good childhood memories. And she loves it! A great classic.	positive
"Let me start out by saying I am very picky about my flat irons. This one is great! Hot heat to get my hair silky straight. 1"" barrel to give me perfect curls that last for days. The plates come together so well and don't tug or break my hair. Definitely would recommend."	positive
I love the size and the ability to write down three different jobs for the day. What I absolutely dislike about it is the time and effort it takes to clean the board off to change the dates for the next month! I tried so many different cleaning products on it and settled for an SOS pad. It worked great, but what a stinking mess to clean off!	negative
Item being returned 2nd time; original returned product was received AGAIN; presumably problem-fixed, but before 1 day's use completed, device began giving false and multiple readings. So returning the 2nd time. not reliable..	negative
It's as pretty as the picture but I thought by the way it read it would be larger. I bought one at Target first. It was cheaper and it's larger. So I was disappointed. Is pretty. Great if your doll is less than 16 in.	negative
Doesn't stamp evenly . Dry in the middle .	negative
So hard to open, way too big, does not shut easily. Too bad I did not use it until it was too late to return.....	negative
Good quality, and they really come in handy!	positive
More of a toy than any actual usefulness. Certainly not 3 x magnification and not clear either.	negative
This peel off mask works well. It gets out blackheads without being painful. Downside is it takes a while to dry but that’s not a problem at all considering the smoothness of my skin afterwards	positive
Good material but doesnt sticks to the screen, keeps coming off, though was maybe one defective so I installed the second one... but same problem.	negative
Exactly what I was looking for. Works great. Very happy with this product.	positive
Waste of money. Too small. Hard to empty. Only one had a cover.	negative
I like the battery life it gives my phone ... but I was more excited it has a stand... but the stand won’t even hold the phone up. Very disappointed.	negative
I love the quality! Everything I could hope for it to be! And came with a nice bag which was great for the gifting!	positive
I ordered a short sleeve with shorts and I got lang sleeves with long pants	negative
I mean I like the material, the airflow when chilling around the house, and fit. They are comfortable. My girl like them. That’s enough for me.	positive
My son is in the Army and uses this solar charger while in the field. He just had it out in the field for three weeks and said it worked really well. He stated it was tough and it charged his devices.	positive
I haven't really had much time to evaluate their usefulness. It takes a little time to get used to using them. I'm sure that this summer I will use them alot .	positive
Bad Quality all around.	negative
I am not sure how this can ever be described as poetry. A bunch of cliche, recycled memes; this is not poetry!	negative
me and my mom hated the taste of this product	negative
Works great, comfortable on the skin.... will buy again if needed!!	positive
Purchased these, changed one of the bulbs and it only lasted one week and blew out.	negative
Two of the four cats enjoy it a lot. Only reason I dropped it to 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wood digs into the drywall. It's plenty sturdy with being mounted into the studs, though.	positive
I love them. I brought them for my clinical notebook to organize my forms. They work well and can be reused	positive
Definitely Cute And Comfortable But It’s Little Loose I Wish They Had An Extra Small.	negative
ITS COMPACT, STURDY AND ACCURATE! WELL MADE AND WORKS GREAT!	positive
Another great book and more of the original characters. We final get to read what is the begin of the next book.	positive
Broke only after one week. Tore where the clip fits into so can no longer wear conveniently	negative
Came opened and leaked in my amazon package. There was no sealant on the package so I don’t know if the product itself was tampered with.	negative
Lasted 6 months and one of the ear buds stopped working. You get what you pay for.	negative
It misses a lot of keystroke.. not recommended for those the fast type kind of people. Not worth $20.	negative
boken, was returned 2 x	negative
I was not aware the item was used and not only that when I received it it had dirt and grunge still on it from the previous owner. Additionally the L button on the left joy con does not work. Unfortunately due to being unavailable for military purposes I cannot return the item until November and not likely to get refunded. Overall, this could have been avoided with more attention to detail especially with a used item. It was filthy. Hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else.	negative
I ordered the Under Armour Men's Armour Fleece 1/2 Zip in Black size Large, what I received was a bright blue top made by Mountain Hardware. Disappointed as this was intended as a Xmas gift.	negative
Disappointed. They act like they have short in the wiring. Bump them in anyway and the go out or flicker	negative
Nice organizer. Wish the binding was a bit more flexible.	positive
Love them! But really wished they would have came with matching frames or something. I feel like I paid to much for what I received.	positive
Does not stay in place, slips forward. Better cushions on the market	negative
Not great. Gets the job done but there are better tools. Also it’s strangely long.	negative
won't work with onkyo speakers... option 2 real fake. Not firm not stable.	negative
Cost keeps going up, but the food is great for an energetic pup.	positive
Absolute garbage. This gadget is plugged into an outlet RIGHT NEXT TO A GARBAGE CAN that is infested with fruit flies. Does absolutely NOTHING. Don’t waste your money.	negative
My bra kept showing because the front kept on exposing it. If you could pin it together with a safety pin, I would. It is great for summer and I could wear it to brunch. Very cute.	positive
Very narrow, to put any refuse into it you basically have to fight the elastic opening.	negative
There is not much to say other than these are strong, durable and comfortable. All the features you need on the go. They are not overly heavy, and the shoulder strap makes them easy to carry other than via the handle. It can be a bit bulky, but thats expected due to its size. No big problem. Definitely the best deal for your buck.	positive
Made in India ... Poor quality and workmanship	negative
This easily hits all fuse needs when it comes to vehicles. The only fuses not covered by this awesome box is the custom ones that only apply to specific vehicles.	positive
"These are very well made ""Y"" adapter cables that I used to connect my 2 channel stereo receiver to a sub woofer. They fit very well-not too tight and not too loose and look quite durable. I recommend them."	positive
I see many good reviews but we had the exact opposite. The majority of the lady bugs arrived dead and I was here on the day of delivery to receive them!!!	negative
Works ok but not as good as hoped	positive
The adhesive sticks well but putting a mount on there bounces like crazy when you're driving. The piece in the middle is just too weak.	negative
Wasn’t made very well and then it’s a 16$ return fee. Not Happy....!	negative
I brought this for my 4 year old granddaughter, she was excited to put it on, the makeup was not very good, little cheesy, couldn’t see it on her face.	negative
Not what I expected. Does keep hot for about 4 hours. Warm about 10. The mouth of the container is pretty small so very hard to use it for chunky soups. Good for coffee or pure liquids.	negative
These are more of a spot pattern then a flood pattern. Bright light if you are only wanting to light up one object, wont cover a large area, have mounted high enough too.	negative
Never getting these again. Mine were nasty and didnt even have any taste or favor at all and what it did have made me want to vomit. Dont waste your money.	negative
Case was pretty hard. Couldn't press any side buttons without forcing them down. Not real grippy. Got rid of it asap.	negative
I bought these because I read they are supposed to be good for plantar fasciitis. My feet still hurt but not as bad & I took out the insole & put a Dr Scholl's for PF in them. I just don't like how wide they look at the toe area. By no means a cute shoe but didn't expect them to be since they are rubber Crocs. I just so need pain relief! I think no matter what shoe I wear I'm still going to have pain. Never ever take your feet for granted.	positive
Brush head too big. Hard to use around teeth. Cumbersome. Bought for travel, but went to a regular sized brush head folding toothbrush.	negative
Got this for a family Christmas party. Was well received and the cat lovers in the fam played for a long time.	positive
The bra is lovely and the fit is good, but the lace on the sides rubs on the inside of my arms and is very uncomfortable.	negative
as good as its supposed to be	positive
I bought these for my boyfriend to wear when he practices his drums at home. They are decent for the cost. When he really gets into some rock songs, its easy to drown these out...but over, they do the job.	positive
Sent the wrong size poster.	negative
By far the easiest cooler to install and the best looking one also. Without RGB. Keeps my CPU cool and under control.	positive
I don't see any contact info to correct the defect. After a year, with a 3 yr warranty, the battery doesn't keep a charge more than a couple of hours now. Who are you supposed to contact?	negative
Did not work used it for two weeks didnt catch a single fly, even though there were tons flying around. Then it broke	negative
Not for a junior high school kid way to much stuff bottom broke, handle felt like it was unlevel	negative
I love this yoga mat! It is cushier and more supportive than my previous travel mat, And it's just as easy to keep it clean. I machine wash it and hang dry it after every use. Thank you Clever Yoga!	positive
very convenient! worked wonderfully in most all cars I tried, and I have an iphone 6plus. So far, I have not been able to successfully use it in a 2007 honda crv.	positive
Ordered 2 sets of what should have been mixed flavors (clearly spells out what the different flavors should be in the description). Instead, received one box of 120 Birthday Cake and a second box of 120 Pina Colada.	negative
"Bought this product to remove sunscreen stains on a leather couch. This product moved the stain around to a bigger area but did nothing to remove it. I later called an independent cleaner to see if he could help and learned 2 things: 1. he could, and did, remove the stain 2. he recommended I toss the product immediately as it's ""awful""."	negative
I gave it 1 star for the simple fact I never used it.Lol.I can say its very well built and solid.I bought it for my android tablet-keyboard.I didnt see it on the description but it is for Windows only.Will not work on Android.Amazon made good on everything thou.As always top notch service.	negative
Nice purse for formal occasions.	positive
Product is very misleading. Yes, Potassium Alum is compromised of larger particles that in theory should be too large to absorb, but when you wet it the particles break down much smaller, and surprisingly can and do get absorbed by the body. Really wanted this to be the golden ticket. Alas, had to find another product that matched my natural deodorant needs.	negative
Arrived in good shape and installed quickly (with help from a more knowledgeable friend, a lot less stressful that way). Took about 10 minutes from opening the box Sound is much better than flat screen downward facing speakers. Sound not quite as good as I hoped, but I am hard of hearing so it might just be me. Also, have to fiddle with TV to get rid of some of the base (I hear treble better). I am happy with the purchase and would do it again.	positive
Disappointed. The picture shown is NOT the same tree. The tree is small, definitely not 6 ft tall. Description and picture are very misleading.	negative
I used this brand of screen protector for my Galaxy S6 for many years and was very happy with the fit and ease of installment. So I bought the same brand for my new A6 phone hoping for the same quality product. The glass didn't adhere to the lower half of my screen so I had to peel it off and throw it away. What a waste.	negative
Is a professional pest control company I bought these for myself and my employees nothing much to rave about. Quality of product is a bit questionable. One would expect a bit of a higher quality from a name Brand like this.	negative
Extremely small! This is my fault for not reading the specs... but pic was deceiving on size for sure. This item is not sturdy and collapses unless packed full... Waste of trunk space.	negative
The screen worked but the ear speaker heats up really hot? Like hot enough to burn your ear when you are talking! I don’t know if this one is defective or what? It also glitches a little when scrolling and won’t let you hold down the delete key in messages making you have to continually click delete until your message is gone. I don’t know if the screen is defective but mine is not good quality.	negative
This book is really amazing and useful book. I am impressed with the wealth of knowledge that the author imparts and found the writing very entertaining as well.	positive
falls off after it stretches	negative
Says delivered but never arrived :(	negative
The main pivot bar that provides the leverage to insert the rivet nut broke upon 4th use. Do not purchase.	negative
good tool for the price	positive
I did not get any stickers in my package	negative
I like it. The colors are amazing	positive
This book will cover their key procedures. You at last approach the mystery trading methodologies of divider road dealers. I felt this book truly separates the phrasing with the goal that everybody can comprehend it. It likewise discloses to you what oversights to maintain a strategic distance from while beginning which is dependably welcome.If you need to find out about swing trading and trading and contributing like a triumphant merchant then this book is for you!	positive
Not like original. Becomes too limp to stand up and is starting to fall apart after two weeks.	negative
Fast service and correct product	positive
Great little mirror. Well made, clear and crisp. Not cheap or flimsy at all.	positive
Not at all what I expected. I think I was sent a dead plant.	negative
All this thing does is run around and sing three rap songs. It isn't educational, and is really stupid!	negative
I did not order a 4pk rubber cages for a iPhone. I have a galaxy s9. I ordered a 4pk slim card hold. Bummer this is a waste of shiping & time. I was looking for to sticking them on the back of my phone case. No I have to wait even longer. What's the point in having Amazon prime when u still have to wait long than expected for ur stuff.	negative
I love this mattress protector, it is the best protector I ever used. I tested it and it is waterproof.	positive
Our son says he loves it. The rapid fire helps his ability to obliterate his competition	positive
Can't receive my usual radio stations. Tried it in different locales to see if it worked any better. Will be returning it and researching, perhaps it needed to be slightly taller..	negative
Good price and sturdy build but the slowest speed is still very fast and patterns aren't as good looking as the other ones my neighbors.	negative
Part two disc for the third movie is defective and does not play. How do I get it replaced?	negative
I was so excited to get this diffuser! I received my diffuser two days ago, I love the lights and the sound, but for some reason the diffuser won’t mist. I can’t smell anything or feel anything from the top part. I am not sure what to do to resolve this issue. I tried refilling the water half way and even to the max line and still nothing. Very bummed.	negative
We never opened box. My husband didn’t need it after we ordered. His foot was not broken. I’m sure it is a great product. Can’t rate if never opened Thanks	negative
Wish I read better, this unit does not support apple carplay. Really wanted one that did. There are other Pioneer decks that do for about the same money.	positive
Only cuts 2 different ways I thought it would slide too but it doesn't	negative
I have many crocs and I have never had any of them bow! Pictures up for reference. I wear 9/10 in crocs depending on the style. Really confused about these. I want to love them but I can’t even like them 😢 I think if I went up a size they would be too big. The length is perfect I cannot say about the width due to the bowing. I’m going to return. So disappointed	negative
I love the product. It just sucks because one A was busted and I recieved 3 H's and one Y . I did make it work but unhappy.	negative
Pretty quiet especially for the size, very disappointed	negative
Would only pair with one of our phones and the tv. Would not pair with any of our tables. Very disappointed.	negative
First I must say, I have never received anything I ever ordered from Amazon arrive in this condition. The pictures are worth a million words. I’m disappointed.	negative
Product arrived as described.. packaged and shipped on time.	positive
I installed strip lighting under the hand rail on my deck, Holds lights perfectly upside down on the bottom of the rail	positive
I love Watkins vanilla. This is tbe 2nd time ordering it. My complaint is with the packaging. I recieved mine without a lid. It just had a foil seal. Very disappointed.	negative
LOVE this shirt for my husband.	positive
Seemingly great!!! Looked good, love the card storage however it offered no protection on the edges and the screen wraps around so needless to say my screen was damaged when I dropped my phone the very 1st time. Now I'm stuck with a $175 to repair my brand new phone. So disappointing!	negative
"Not bad to install if your mechanically inclined. No instructions included if your not. I was happy with everything except the gap between headlight and turn signal. OEM fit tight these have a 1/4"" gap. I'll get over it for the price."	positive
Probably the best shower liner I’ve ever purchased. I’ll favorite & repurchase for our other bathrooms. Pleased!	positive
Product stopped working after second use. I brought it for my office and it was great until it just didn't turn on anymore. I didn't contact the seller for return because I threw.away all packaging related to the item. Extremely upset. Shipping was very fast.	negative
Good product enjoyed for Christmas	positive
An old favorite I never tire of... even though it does feel like it should have been a full-on novel. I love all the movie versions as well. The language is kinda antiquated and will surely put off some readers, but it's full of all kinds of vivid descriptions and fascinating ideas about our possible future that still hold relevance today. The template is timeless and I can see this one being retold over and over with random variations for years to come...	positive
Nice bag considering the price. I misread the discription and thought it was real leather. It is very hard to tell by looking at it though. It has a nice feel to it and the size is good, although I think all the pockets inside are a little overkill and actually take away some of the room. The two interchangeable straps are pretty handy and it is great that you don't need to have both straps attached at the same time. Some handbags do. This bag is nice looking, rather classy.	positive
Case fits my fiesta 2 I haven't tried the screen protector since I already have one but seems it would fit although it doesn't seem as durable or thick as others I have used	positive
arrived on time product as described	positive
Did not seat properly upon rib of 870 shotgun. The baseplates under the rib bend when you screw them in tightly. Upon tightening one of the baseplates stripped out. Pretty cheap design.	negative
The colors and print are true to the photo. I was pleasantly surprised with the neatness of the stitching and zipper. The fabric feels soft, which works well for a living room throw blanket. I'll update the review after I've washed the cover a few times. Pretty good deal for the price point!	positive
Good product... Just what you expect in an 18 hour bra.	positive
The item I ordered was not what was in the package, a shower curtain was inside the box. Not very happy	negative
Probably the worst fc ever. The vtx didnt work well.	negative
Worked great for 4 months at one cup or less per day. Now only half of the water comes out before it shuts off.	negative
Crazy ride. Could not put it down. Read it on one sitting. Hard to believe people like this exists...unbelievable really.	positive
Bright light, holds charge well	positive
the inside was white like, not a good look for a black/flower print on the outside, in my opinion. I also felt it looked terribly cheap. I know it was a tiny price, but still... set it back.	negative
I successfully paired this with my iPhone and the sound is acceptable for my office. But the lowest volume setting on my phone is still too loud. The biggest frustration and why I may return is because it will NOT pair with my laptop - which I need for work. I'm also REALLY confused by the reviews because I chose this item because it had over 2,000 reviews with 5 stars. I NEVER would have chosen an item with 9 reviews (at time of purchase) with avg 1.5 stars.	negative
I wanted to love these shoes. However, the stitching on the top of the shoe has no give whatsoever and cut into the top of my feet. I kept them and my daughter who has super slim feet wears and loves them instead.	positive
Not like the iOS version	negative
"This is the 2nd umbrella that I've bought off Amazon that advertised as ""windproof"" and then snapped as soon as there was any strong gust. It worked great until I went out with it on a somewhat window day and it suddenly flipped, breaking one of the metal pieces. I'm very disappointed."	negative
I’d rather have bought two books I know are good over having a set of four that are underwhelming	negative
Looks good in person. Very light weight and water resistant.	positive
Came quick. Fit like it should. Great price	positive
It’s a good design however on the instructions it gives you the option to modify the space on your nose..and the product doesn’t have that feature.. i was very disappointed.	negative
"Needed this for a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Power hungry. Works as described, no longer getting ""under voltage"" issues."	positive
This belt is not leather but the construction and detail are nice.	positive
I was in love with these when I first got them, but within 2 months they stopped pairing and connecting. I called support and everything they told me didn't work so they ended up refunding me which I was sad about because I really wanted a replacement because I loved them so much.	negative
Best hiking cleats- they stay put and give stability.	positive
We wanted seat cushions that wouldn't slip and would br easier to clean then the ones we had. These fit the bill.	positive
This pot is nice, but the 4 times we have used it there is metal shavings in our coffee. The instructions says not to wash the pot with anything but water, but after the 2nd time we did use soap. We cleaned it good to even used a strong light to look for metal shavings, but we still got metal with our coffee. They should clean there product better befor sending it to there customer's.	negative
Opened it right when I got it. Went to put it on my cat. It vial was completely empty. Looked at the other two vials and they were also empty.	negative
I ordered these pin because made in USA but box shows made in China don’t like it I am going to send back	negative
I bought these instead of the pens I had been using. Portability is good but ink supply does not last long and they are not comfortable to hold and write. I do like that they are NOT multi-colored ink even though the pens are differing colors.	negative
Didn’t work the second I put them on. My 83 year old mom still tells me that you get what you pay for	negative
"I have used Digest It RV toilet treatment for several years and it seems to work well. The product arrived as scheduled, but there was not label on the gallon jug. Just a small 3"" by 1"" address label with the name on it. No label containing directions, contents, warnings, etc. I can only assume I received the real thing."	positive
These are great, especially if you want to take your paints on the go. Thanks for including 3 brushes.	positive
I bought 2 watches for my sons. Boys love this watch. Clear sound when calling ! Worth the price, so I am pleased with it. Thanks!	positive
bose headset can't be controlled with this. Have to go to the device. not worth the price. returning.	negative
Very thin. I doubled them up.	negative
Can somebody tell how tf they paired these to iPhone	negative
My unit broke after the first use	negative
I bought this awhile back. This mattress is quite firm so if you aren't looking for that, I would probably avoid this mattress. It expanded just as expected and was definitely a great mattress considering how cheap it was.	positive
Glowed for a week and were real neat. However, now you can barely see them. They lost their glow.	positive
I bought this just to play Spider-Man and Bloodborne, and it does an amazing job! I like the UI a little more than the Xbox UI. It just seems like it is more easy to get around.	positive
It seems to fit my Bissell floor cleaner but I've not yet tested the product by using my Bissell floor cleaner. So I'll have to wait for more exhaustive tests to see whether the product is fit for purpose	negative
Fits my 2 1/2 inch ball mount perfectly, also available for the more common 2 inch square ball mounts. Part marketed to dampen vibration and reduce noise. It does neither in my experience. Also a *lot* of money for a wee bit of foam that one could sculpt in a minute with a pocketknife. Not recommended.	negative
The young man I gave this to thought it was GREAT	positive
I ordered this item a week ago and amazon has informed it was lost. They have not asked about trying to send out another one or giving me a gift card for their failures.	negative
FIlament is a darker blue color with a good matte or glossy finish depending on your print temperature. I have already used half the spool with no problems. I will be purchasing more in the future.	positive
This cable management cord quickly organized my TV cords for my wall mounted TV. Simple yet effective.	positive
Totally awesome! Slices through roast with ease.A win in our family. Thank You!	positive
Product itself is great. Really disappointed with the supplier from amazon. It came (knowingly by them) damaged. Broken and taped up, but “new”.	negative
perfect light weight and comfortable - would buy again	positive
If you only have ten minutes for a quick smoke, this pipe is a good option. Otherwise, the small bowl is not optimal. Just about when you've settled in, it's over. Wish I had seen what this looked like before I ordered it.	negative
Perfect for starter sewers. I need a bigger one now but, nice for those just starting.	positive
Good no frills case. Simple, inexpensive & serves as a protective cove without paying the (crazy) prices at the phone store	positive
This laptop sleeve/case is perfect for I needed it for. I bought this case for my HP Stream 11.6 in. fits perfect, nice and snug and safe. great material on the inside. thick material, not thin or cheap at all. I'm really happy with the price as I only paid $8.99. Couldn't get a better deal!!!	positive
I ordered this & never even received it.	negative
I received it on time and look forward to working on them.	positive
Made cheaply. Did not last one month.	negative
Definitely a good gift for a man	positive
They were too tight even for little girls and one broke right away. The shorter one seems sturdier and may be usable long term. The other isn’t worth the purchase.	negative
All Black, fit great even with mods. Wish I didn't have to sand of the bottom bump to remove mods.	positive
These are great for quilting. I was able to continue quilting while recovering from thumb surgery. I have since recovered and I still use them.	positive
I ordered it and it did not come. I waited almost a month and nothing. Amazon did return my money though.	negative
There is a place for everything; lots of compartments within each section. It seems very sturdy; but I've only taken it on a few trips. It looks great too.	positive
Gorgeous and stays on because you don’t have to continually pull it up. Will snag very easily.	positive
Zipper broke on the hamper bag not even 2 weeks after we got it.	negative
"Good story. Very ""Jack Reacher"" like. Enjoyed it very much."	positive
I love this clock but I’ve had numerous problems with it. The first one a peice of the wood was broken off. Now a few months of being on my wall. The clock part broke off then The Who clock face instantly came unglued	negative
I would like to bring to your attention, that twice now I have placed an order for two packages of this item, and in these two instances only one package is being shipped.	negative
Worth the price and arrived on time . My hands are small os easy to use, has excellent RPM and cord was nice length. I recommend this item.	positive
The case overall seems really nice and clean but, the only problem is that the fit was too loose and the phone falls out the case.	negative
Grandsons birthday. He loves it.	positive
Its just like the size of a lighter. Fits in your pockets nothing bulky. Sound quality is above average. Pairing is a breeze. No problems at all. I would have wanted a black silicone for the earpiece instead of white other than that its all good.	positive
description did not match.	negative
Well it lasted about 4 months and now has started dragging, barely turning	negative
I take it to help with my cholesterol levels. Seems to be helping.	positive
I wish the batteries on these damn things didn’t die to quickly, and that the vibrators would stay in the rings better, also wish they were easy to turn on. Only one worked and not for very long	negative
Christmas gift for grandson he loves you to read to him.	positive
Really cheap quality, come with a rip on the side	negative
Didn’t say in the description that gold doesn’t work with our cable provider. This ended up in the trash after a $70 service call	negative
Was hoping it was thick.. almost paste like.but bad tho	positive
Very cheap flag. Paper thin, not for flying in normal weather. Best as a wall mount. Design is nice but that’s the only reason I give it 2 stars. If it weren’t for that, it would be 1 star.	negative
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY WEAR AS I have neuropathy in my ankles and legs. Legs are super sensitive to any touching. Please sen me a return mailing label very soon.	negative
Didn’t like the smell, also really less lather 🧼	negative
Very bright, but it fell off my back pack on the first ride.	negative
Very quiet. just wished the fans had more power to them.	positive
Very small table. The items processed must be around 5 inches at most. The table will not allow for bigger pieces of food.	negative
Not at all what I expected, need to return it will not work in my situation	negative
Since I bought it from the clearance section, it’s not eligible for a return/replacement..... nice.	negative
I bought these for broccoli sprouts. Sure, they work well with jars, but they won't last long if the first batch of sprouts caused the mesh to rust. The quest for a quality non-plastic sprouting solution continues...	negative
Looked cool but broke almost immediately. Cheap.	negative
Good candy. A few of them were stale, but most of them were fine. The price is almost worth it.	positive
I don't know about its durability since i had it just a week ago. But fitting is well and it feels very comfortable in hands.	positive
I have to press down on the top of the thing for the speaker to work. As soon as I let up on it the sound stops.	negative
I don't write reviews ever, but holy geez! This stuff is great. I've been through countless ointments and creams for my French bulldog. Not only has nothing worked in the past, but he's actually scratched his cornea trying to remove products from his snout. I forgot what his nose looked like under the dry scales that formed on his nose. After only three applications, all of the dry scales have fallen off. My boys nose is completely smooth and moist, and no longer dry and crusty. This stuff is incredible!!	positive
The older one that this was supposed to replace was far better at cleaning and polishing. Disappointed with product!	negative
I got purple because I thought it was so pretty. I also got it in medium, but it’s still big on me. I guess you could say it’s one of those nightgowns where you can eat a midnight snack and not feel like a pig afterwards..	positive
Wouldnt buy again the pump came broken and hard to blow a ballon. The balloons are amazing colors but a few were ripped or pop so fast while adding air	negative
No good. Lost all my bass	negative
Liked the idea of it but it's very bulky and the magnets SUCK	negative
Love this shirt. Colors are vibrant. Fit is as expected. Material is soft and comfortable.	positive
feather go everywhere off from it and they are super thin	negative
Works great. Very bright and a good price.	positive
Very pleased with this bottle. It does just what is advertised!	positive
It smells good. That's the only good thing about it. This product sprays on with a wet greasy feel the dries with a powder like feel. I have to use so much to make it work that it starts to turn my hair white and then it feels heavy and leaves my hair feeling even dirtier. To top it off it didn't wash out all the way after I shampooed my hair. Definitely one my least favorite dry shampoos I've tried. And it's not available for returns.	negative
Perfect for a night out! These lashes look great, great quality and very easy yo apply once you have mascara on	positive
Ink dry and not good. Don't buy from Amazon	negative
Bought a set for my husband and my dad for Christmas. Both loved them and had a great laugh. Wish they came in different calibers, but if that were the case then they wouldn't be real :-)	positive
Fittment was horrible and color was more red then orange.	negative
I wish I bought these sooner. I noticed a significant savings in just a month as I used to leave to lights burning 24/7 in the front and back yards. These LED lights are very bright in a positive way and help me to easily see my front driveway area as well as my back patio area in the back.	positive
Never worked. Paypal said it was not their product and not for use with their product	negative
Still isn’t here after 3 days after the latest expected date.	negative
The watch is exactly what I wanted. It's dainty and feminine and looks like a bracelet vs a big bulky watch.	positive
So far so good, BUT... there is a lot of repetition. This does not move the book along but it does make it longer. Now that I know that there are 3+ more books in this series I am out. It's not Lord of the Rings - it's longer! I wish him luck. I have invested all the money I intend to spend with this guy.	positive
Lots of fun but the battery only last about 5-7 minutes	positive
Pleased so far. Not sure how long they'll last, as we've just started writing with them.	positive
Received quickly with no issues. I have not been able to read it to finish yet.	positive
Didn't work. Bad colors. Waste of money.	negative
A picture says a thousand words. I did get a refund, but this was disappointing.	negative
I really wish this mirror would have worked out for me. Unfortunately, it came broken from the back piece, which I let slide, but once I set it up...the LED lights would just flicker a quick on/off once I turned the switch on. I just returned the item. The mirror itself was beautiful as well as very clear.	negative
The irony was that it leaked inside my dry bag and damaged the things inside. Had to throw some of the damaged things away. Concept 5/5, execution 0/5. Item too cheap to go through the hassle of returning / asking for a refund. Warning others to buy at their own risk is just dumb, so DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.	negative
Decent hat but size is not accurate.	positive
I was super excited to try these out. Some colors aren't very pigmented at all. I mean like the red is basically pink. I thought, maybe because they're water-based? But some colors are actually very pigmented so that didn't make sense. Half of the black shades were basically dried out when I received them and one marker has a broken tip so it's not even that fine. For the price it's whatever, but next time I'll definitely splurge for a higher quality set.	negative
Well-made, classy-looking, and unbreakable. Great idea for a wine glass.	positive
I’ve worn it multiple times and no one can tell the difference but me. I wear it mostly at night. My only complain is that it should come with more belt holes. I tried to make my own and nearly damaged the belt.	positive
Stained with eggs later I check now rusting .	negative
I set this up for my Mother to use in her laundry room, and it collapsed almost right away. It was filled, but not crammed full or filled with heavy clothes. The whole frame twisted, bent and collapsed. We had purchased this rack because the stated load rating was higher than other similar units. Although it was very easy to assemble, I would not waste my money on it again.	negative
I ordered these and even paid for same day delivery. 4 days later, multiple calls and finally showed up. To late as these were a gift and the day had passed. You can get these cheaper and quicker even at Walmart.!	negative
Did not last long!! Bought another one from different seller	negative
It's real easy to put together only issue I had was that the woods cheap and the screws tear thru it real easy if you use a drill to put them in	negative
These are very flimsy and thin. Very disappointed. Most of them don’t even look heart shaped. Do not buy.	negative
Just as nice as a $50 one I had for my first daughter, with cute colors and bear graphics. My 2+ month old baby isn’t quite strong enough to push the buttons on the piano, but she likes the songs and lights it plays. But note, some of the songs are Christmas songs, which we find funny, since it isn’t a Christmas themed item!! Hee hee!	positive
"This top was so much smaller than the ""large"" I thought I was ordering. The size chart did not match what I typically wear from the store."	negative
I ordered mediums because I am U.S size 7-8 these were mediums but would fit maybe somebody that's a 0-1 U.S size.	negative
Update: This seller saw my comment and refunded me for the robe. They have great customer service! This robe is okay but there is way too much fluff coming off of it. When I wash and dry it, I can’t put any other items in with them because the fluff gets onto everything. Even when wearing, the fluff gets all over clothes and hair. I’ve washed it several times but the fluff just won’t go away. I have to look for another robe. What a waste of money.	negative
Friends had a different animal that worked great. I think that this one is too thin to create enough air. Look for a fat or round one.	negative
I really like this game on PC that’s why I Gave it 4 stars so I wanted to support this on the switch so more Tell Tale games would come to it. However as of right now I can’t recommend this on the Switch. It doesn’t save your game and it randomly changes your choices it’s completely broken. I’ve replayed episode 4 four times only for it to not save and randomly change my choices from previous episodes	positive
Just what I needed to connect a mini camera to my laptop to review video on camera. Works perfectly. Good price.	positive
This clock is accurate and a good size for old eyes.	positive
It took a while to figure out the installation, but it is now making ice as expected. The instruction book is terrible, very difficult to understand. Reads like a poor translation.	positive
My son is 6 feet and weighs approx. 165 lbs. The large fit him much better than the M. He wont really zip it up, and this is great for that.	positive
The black slide on the right is for this review. I put one of those on and then another style slide. They fit almost true to size, just a slight big. I am an 8 1/2 - 9 and the 8-9 fit is almost perfect. I wear them out and about, running errands and they are so much cuter and WAY MORE comfortable than a flip flop.	positive
Much cheaper here than at the drug store.	positive
I thought this was from DEe Zee. This is not Dee Zee. It is a cheap knock-off. The hydraulic arm is so tight it is now a nuisance to wait till the tailgate lowers. It even took my whole body weight and channel locks to pull it out long enough to install from the truckbed to the tailgate. I would never buy this again. In fact I’m returning it and I just installed it.	negative
Two of the three pans have non-removable burn stains. Would not recommend.	negative
Don’t order this. It came broken. I can still use it though. It has labels on them and you cannot completely remove it either. Such a shame.	negative
Works great once under water you don’t really notice it there is just a little more weight not bad	positive
Just what i needed- came quickly Use it in out door water fountain.	positive
Was not even delivered!	negative
These were so cute and cozy. the toe was really big but they only lasted a month and the bottoms just shredded. Get the ones with the soles	negative
It worked 20 minutes and then started turning around. Turned off and on a few times but the same, it went crazy. I had to return it the same day.	negative
Love this sweatshirt. Just wish it had more colours to choose from. You can layer shirts under it as it is roomy and washes great	positive
Bought three, two as gifts and one for myself. Well packaged on arrival. Very pleased with this product.	positive
Great for keeping my essential oils in order in my dresser drawer.	positive
battery dead after 5 shaves always... junk.	negative
I will not order from this seller again. The first time I checked it said the package was lost then it said it was found. The package arrived 3 days after graduation even though I ordered it 4 weeks earlier. I have only been able to email them ( no personal person) and now they want me to send it back.	negative
I like the top it first well and looks pretty close to the picture	positive
I bought this for my husband because he loves to work in the garage and he really loves it. He said it wipe oil better than other towels that I got for him. There is 25 towels in the pack and the towels are good size towels. I dont have to wash it as often as there is more than enough for him to last for a week at least.	positive
Was hoping my 1 year old grandson would be interested. He was'nt, my 3 year old was.	positive
This was already gelled in the container when I opened it. Since I had purchased two, I was hoping the other one would be okay. It was even worse. There is a no return policy on this item, so I am out of luck. I wanted to try something different than ModPodge for glass transfers.	negative
Good compression but thumb hole is way too tight! Slept with mine on and woke up with a bruise around my thumb. Size up from what the chart says.	positive
I love CoQ-10 because I use it in conjunction with my Cholesterol medication and it helps control my cholesterol.	positive
Pages in this book are missing...	negative
Much better than the blade that came with my Echo edger.	positive
Pants had a small hole in them and it eventually spread. I should have returned them but didn’t think it would spread so quickly. Cheaply made. Kids loved them though, and they grow so quickly it wasn’t that big of a deal I guess?	negative
Little lights on a tiny wire. They plug into a use cable.	positive
Installed this at our home a few months ago and an AT&T Maintenance Engineer came to our house today and told us we must remove it because it is NOT FCC Compliant and is transmitting a signal it is not supposed to.	negative
This review is for the mDesign Free Standing Corner Storage Shelf, not their rotating organizer. I was hoping to put medium size plates on the top shelf but it falls forward. Terrible.	negative
I have been through 4 of these. They work great, but I did have one leak on me. The price is so great I didn’t care though. You can get 6 of these for the price of 1 official brand filter.	positive
They are comfortable bras, however the seams on the two bras I purchased came apart in the exact same spots. Not very pleased.	negative
My daughter loves these!	positive
This printer was ordered for our small public library, It barely lasted a year before it started printing underlines an inch below all text. It was determined by Epson that the printer is defective, and is not fixable by cleaning the print heads or replacing the cartridges. Please contact us regarding this issue.	negative
Product was a week later than advertised and does not work. I need to know how to send it back.	negative
So far it’s going well. The app does crash a lot. The trick is to the app is to completely close it and open it each time for use.	positive
The foot bath basin has become a welcome addition to my weekly maintenance routine. As a runner, my feet were often sore and calloused by the end of the week. Using the basin, combined with the soaking recipe, has drastically improved the condition of my feet and their recovery time. And my daughter enjoys using it too!	positive
Product comes off and didn’t work well at all	negative
A great phone case. Lightweight and fits my iPhone 6 perfectly. It came fully charged which was a nice bonus. Packaged with care. Very neat feature in that you press the button and the exterior lights on the case tell you how much charge the case itself holds so you know when it needs to be recharged.	positive
This wig looks like a dollar store Halloween wig	negative
Great product , very realistic. Have it displayed in our summer place. Serves the purpose. Took a while to get but happy with the product.	positive
I haven't recd these yet so that is why my review is low.	negative
found that you need a second one, best ice cream ever.	positive
This product seems like a cheap marker. I feel like I could take my crayola markers and get a better line. It definitely stays on and won't come off but doing second coats for a bolder look or correction don't really work. I also store it with the point facing down and still don't get enough out of the tip. I thought I'd try it for the price and unfortunately it just didn't work for me.	negative
Slim cans fit great, however I’m pretty disappointed. It does not keep drinks cold anymore then a normal coozie. We are big yeti fans, I would definitely buy a yeti slim can coozie over Brumate. You can tell by the weight of the coozie itself it no where near yeti. It’s very light weight.	negative
I love these sunglasses. The frames are loose fitting for my head, but otherwise fit well. I get compliments on the way they look.	positive
This little steamer has been such a convenience! IT has been so nice to have it to take with me on the go. It doesn't take up much space at all and fits nicely in my suitcase, so I can take it easily on business trips!	positive
it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase ....	positive
Got it for my wife. She wears it with dresses and skirts during summer. Very stretchy and feel comfortable. I took one star off because she says they are somewhat see through and she would not wear them alone, but its perfect for short skirts.	positive
I have ordered about 3 of these over the years and they look great but they are not quite strong enough if you live somewhere that gets windy. Since they are aluminum they don't rust but they do break eventually. Usually the teeth (for angle adjustment) break off or the main bolt pulls through the bracket. I like the fact that they don't trust so I just keep buying them. They are inexpensive.	negative
Ruined my expensive clothes. This stuff effectively bleaches colored fabrics. What junk, took a small stain and destroyed $100 outfit. Be careful.	negative
Did not get this product! Received something totally different	negative
This product does not work. It is a scam. Amazon please remove this item from your listing.	negative
Recieved these today, and immediately tried on the rose gold one. It was easy to open and put on and a little difficult to close. At one point I thought it was closed but it wasn’t. So far it’s good, hopefully it stays on throughout my shift at work without issues.	positive
The construction is pretty poor. Do not expect to last very long.	negative
Story building doesn't happen. MC powers is too overpowered. MC is lvl 5 and can make slave collars and put them on anyone? Also the MC can make and enchant his own gear, seriously. Very short book author spends enormous amount of pages on skill sheets and weapon descriptions. This book seems like it would be an authors draft of an idea he wants to create as a story instead of one. Save your money.	negative
Like others have said, messy welds and bent flukes. I got the Guardian anchor, much superior.	negative
It is really bright.	positive
The item came to me in an undamaged UPS box. The items box inside the ups box was badly damaged. The damage was supposedly inspected by amazon before shipment. At least the sticker from amazon claims this. i Think they hired someone that doesn't care about there job. You could feel the damage through the ripped hole in the box. Second time now amazons inspections have failed me. Im waiting on a new replacement i hope this one makes it undamaged.	negative
don't have use for it no more	negative
Still sounds like creed. Very good.	positive
Good product, fast shipping, will buy again	positive
Doesn't stick. I've installed so many screen protectors having five kids so not new to the process and this one was a total waste of money.	negative
Went to use it the other day and after filling it with water I couldn't get the top to go back on. Only had it a month and never used it that much. Very disappointed.	negative
Wore only twice and started peeling. This is not my first pair from dream pairs, so i am sad to give such a low rating my others lasted an appropriate amount of time.	negative
Never ordered, don't know how to get a refund.	negative
Fits perfectly on my desk and the sound quality is good. The battery lasts a long time	positive
It's so puny, i can barely find it around the house. Can't even attach it to my keys because the hole is too small!	negative
Has maybe worked a total of 5 minutes since getting it almost a month ago. And it’s in direct sunlight	negative
I sized up due to the reviews and it was huge! The fabric was cheap.	negative
This digital alarm clock is like no other. It looks like a generic one but it has a lot of features. Not only does it look sleek, but it look so cool with blue led light instead if the usual red one. It really stands out and pops so you can notice the time. I used to use the red one and I got tired of it real fast.	positive
Four stars only because the lights did not align with the eyeballs. Fit well, the kids love them and want a pair themselves.	positive
Just Stop working and I no longer use this item I wish it was better, does not work as described and perform as stated, maybe I gotten a bad product	negative
This shirt is a bit tight for a medium, but it fits well enough. I returned it because the white is see through, I'm keeping the black one. I won't be buying it in more colors because I don't like the little buttons. I washed it before wearing because it was wrinkled and quite stiff. It came put out of the dryer much softer and not wrinkled.	positive
There really is info in here, that I have not read anywhere else.	positive
Overall dislike of the shoe.	negative
Fits well, but bubbles persist. Main problem is with FaceID, once the protector is on, faceID becomes useless. The iPad will tell you Camera Covered. That’s the main thing that made me reject this. Did I put it on wrong? Put on opposite side? Missing a layer somewhere? No idea, the instructions are as barebones as they come.	negative
Love them. It's not real red skin peanuts but in good quality.	positive
Fast delivery & product as advertised	positive
the cap can't seal up perfectly, the bottle handle is too lose to stay in where it should be.	negative
Two of the four have broken through the first wall. Not recommended. Other brand has a lifetime warranty. I wish I’d spent the money.	negative
Arrived in a box too small for it so it was poking out of the bottom, with the tag ripped off of it and NO CLAMP at all to be seen. If it was supposed to be welded on, I don’t think it ever was because there is no mark where anything broke off - the main feature of this hook was the adjustable clamp, so this is completely unusable for that purpose.	negative
Good for what I needed for	positive
Works as intended - in my case - using it strictly as a archive device - thus it's not plugged in all the time - I plug it up - do my archiving & then disco it ... no issues ...	positive
I had the opportunity to test these brushes today with some BBQ I cooked. The brushes held up well with no melting when used with heated BBQ sauce. The bristles held plenty of sauce as I transferred from the bowl and was able to evenly coat the meat. Clean up was simple, and easy cleanup with soap and water. I did not notice any residue on the bristles. These brushes have a very grippy feel and some weight to them. They do not feel cheap and will look great in my kitchen. Very happy.	positive
I was sent the wrong type of eyelash with no way to exchange or return it.	negative

I like the jacket, but got a bright red color when I ordered maroon/burgundy. (If i got the right color would have been 5 star review)	positive
Great for the price. Didn’t expect it to look this nice.. took 1 point away just because there were no instructions which resulted in putting it on upside down first as you can see by the picture. Haha but once it was flipped the correct way, it will work perfect for desired outcome.	positive
The pictures I provided show the condition that I received this Pop in. Smashed and Ripped! This was a gift for my nephew. The Pop packaging is part of the product, especially for those who collect Pops that keep them in their original packaging.	negative
The adhesive sticks to both sides of the tape so you have to rub on it to get it off, and half the time it barely sticks to the page where you want it put.	negative
Quality was ok but very weird fit. I'm 5'9 140 with cyclist/runner build. Medium was very low waist, tight through the thigh, loose in the calf and short length. I sent them back and bought some Pearl Izumi. A lot more expensive but much better fit.	negative
These markers are like all the other crayon markers. Don’t be fooled by the pretty package. They bleed real bad through the paper too!	negative

I bought this impact specifically to expedite the front end replacement on my SUV. I estimate it shaved a couple hours off the job vs using a breaker bar and ratchet. The 5ah battery lasted the whole time. I never had to use a breaker bar for the stubborn bolts. The impact broke them free with ease. This impact will pay itself off in the amount of time saved and busted knuckles.	positive
Good value for well-made T-shirts. These shirts are all I will buy now. Material is excellent and they do not shrink much.	positive
I have kitchen chairs with a nice cloth seat that is supposed to be easy to clean as it is an indoor/outdoor material. Well, my kids did a real number on them. Someone at my husband's job told him this stuff would do the trick after I gave up on two other products. It certainly made a difference in the stains but it isn't perfect. I am going to do another application. The directions mentioned some sort of tool that did NOT come with the bottle. Just sayin'.	positive
It counts accurately great option with or without sound easy to use	positive
This thermal underwear fit just right and are of good quality.Keep my legs warm but not too hot,comfy enough that you don't really know you have them on.They stay up where they're supposed to be and the leg bottoms don't roll up and aren't too tight.	positive
Easy to use, easy to set up. Perfect for getting a little extra light when you need it.	positive
Unfortunately I did not open these rulers until I was on a quilt retreat last week and the larger of the two is broken. According to this info return time is past. At the high price of this ruler set I feel they should replace it!!!!!	negative
This pet fountain has a nice design, doesn't take up much space, and is large enough for multiple cats to use. The LED light looks very cool, but I keep it off since I worry about the safety of having a light inside of my cat's drinking water. My cat is very picky and won't drink water from a water bowl, but she seems to like this fountain.	positive
Seems to be a high quality purse for the price. All the separate pockets are what I look for in a purse	positive
Been waiting on product since 18 of February was supposed to are end of March have emailed seller and no response it’s april 22 still no product and no response	negative
Not sure the point of this product, as the holder tool barely holds the blades, and if you press hard at all the blades will slide out of the holder, even when tightened down to the max. This product should enable you to scrape stuff with some amount of force, otherwise you might as well just use your fingernail. The tightening knob is also plastic and seems fragile.	negative
These are quite nice and added a little color to my holiday gifts.	positive
This is very bulky and it hangs the placard very high so it may be missed.	negative
