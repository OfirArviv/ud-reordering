Shoes were purchased on March 6, 2019. My wife wore them a couple times a week since receiving them. April 19, 2019 one of the leather straps broke. Checked return policy and it expired on April 6. One month of warranty? Won't buy shoes from Amazon again.	negative
Each cartridge printed once. Both dried up in less than two weeks. I will not buy from this seller again.	negative
No light hard to see	negative
Sent shoes back. Wore them around the house for 20 minutes and my feet started to hurt.	negative
I ordered this giving the correct size. However, when it came it is way too big. It is even too big for my husband. All they will do is refund me $3 because it was engraved. I feel that it should be replaced because the measurement is completely wrong from what I ordered.	negative
Doesn’t even remotely taste like licorice	negative
I had pink hair, I was taking the color out with vitamin c tablets and dandruff shampoo but I heard this product would help me take out the color better. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I left it on for 20 minutes and when I checked it, it was gray/light blue. I have no idea how it could possibly turn this color if I had no type of blue tones in my hair only pink and reds.. I'm devistated by the outcome of my hair.	negative
Chargers stopped working less than a month after I started using them. Very disappointed.	negative
I ordered wrong size these have to be bigger than what you normally wear for some reason	negative
The device has good appearance and seems to work well. However, it has a major flaw in that there is no back up battery to maintain clock time in the event of a power outage. I returned it for that reason	negative
Don’t buy! I ordered Mango flavor specifically for flavor and received regular Fruit Punch! Waste of money and false advertisement!	negative
This did not say #10 or Messi. This was a gift for my son and he is very disappointed. Returning it.	negative
Phone was delivered. Speaker full of junk. Plugged in and gave plenty of time to charge to 100% unplugged it and was at 5% in less than 10 min not even in use	negative
Split three of them within four hours of use. They were very comfortable prior to failure. Too bad, they did not last. Junk	negative
charges for a few minutes then stops. utter garbage.	negative
"Wired it up. At first it was fine, then it flickered, and now nothing. ""Not eligible for returns."" :("	negative
Was not too happy. Product reduced the touch sensitivity on the right side of phone Took off phone Due to annoyance.	negative
I certainly must have got a fake Sebastian! Purchased this for its reputable name however I am so disappointed, it does not hold my hair and the smell is dreadful. Never want to buy this product again. Please check details before you buy!	negative
It comes with two cords but only one of each head. I only have Apple products so I could only really use one cord at a time and then the lightening head for Apple products stopped working in less than a month so I returned the product. Also it doesn’t work well if your case has a cover over the charging portal and the cord disconnects really easily.	negative
The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon.	negative
I have just receive this product and while the outer security seal seemed intact, the lid came off easily without breaking the seal and the inner seal was not intact.	negative
Too bulky in the middle	negative
I received an email from the company concerning this product. It said if I put any credit cards in the pockets they will possibly be ruined. I received this email after I bought this product. Please take my advise and don’t buy this product.	negative
I thought this would be a great gift for my eight-year-old grandson and he was wildly excited about it, but the screws were so tiny and hard to handle and the holes for them so misaligned, that assembly was nothing but frustration for both of us. I ended up returning it.	negative
I bought a set of these and when they came one side had no audio. I returned them and figuring it was a fluke, I purchased them again. After charging them, I unplugged them from the charger and the bottom broke off exposing the wires. One button also wouldn't push when pressed. DON'T BUY	negative
Broke in the first week don't waste your money	negative
Did not work on 2005 F-150 like description claims	negative
Crap, I'd like money back. Lousy story line, if thats what its called, lots of shooting but very few scenes of aliens.	negative
Strange products not advertised with jalapeños and nothing good. All chips were packed on top and smashed.	negative
Never received product. Very disappointed.	negative
The pencil feels good in the hand however when I write I feel a clicking between the red plastic ring and the metal, I am not that heavy-handed because I write daily with an extra fine point gold tip fountain pen. I was expecting more for the price, maybe I received a fake, not worth my time to research. I would not recommend this to anyone due to my experience.	negative
Listing says brushed nickel. Box arrived and labeled satin nickel. Waste of time. Simple description and they got it wrong.	negative
What a wast of money. They fall apart and are hard to light and when they do burn they don't burn slow.	negative
Product is innacurate. Temperature off by several degrees.	negative
Ordered the Cherry Jolly Ranchers and none of them taste like cherry! I have ordered these several times, but this last bag was not right! The wrappers say cherry, but clearly is not!	negative
A year subscription of Eating Well was purchased as a gift in Dec 2018. To date-as of July 2019- the gift issues still have not been received. We are very disappointed. We have a 1 star rating as a zero rating was not accepted by the system.	negative
Too thick and big. Unattractive.	negative
Cheaply manufactured but good whilst it lasts.	negative
I do not recommend this product does not work	negative
Never recieved this item... First bad experience on amazon. No reply from seller. 3rd party seller, will NOT do again if I can help it.	negative
Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a bit too tight. My main concern is how extremely thin they are. They feel cheaply made and am certain they'll snag/run my first wear.	negative
My husband said they were comfortable and all, but the second time he wore them the seam was already splitting up the back. And he doesn't have much of a butt, so it wasn't due to added pressure!	negative
I only got one pillow on the order even tho you pay for two. Also it is way darker than the picture shows. Not real happy about this order. I can’t seem to get ahold of anyone to get my other pillow.	negative
SENT ONE ORDER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. AMAZON GOT A SUPPOSED FREE REPLACEMENT. NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR THE OTHER ORDER. WASN'T MY FAULT THE VENDOR MESSED UP.	negative
Very cheap plastic. I couldn’t get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn’t work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening.	negative
My kid was able to unleash himself within minutes.	negative
Lights constantly flicker	negative
Posts were not coated.	negative
I ordered this item two months ago and never received it. I also contacted the seller who did not contact me back. I feel as if my money was stolen.	negative
I like the weight of the jacket but after standing in a heavy rain my back was damp.	negative
Didnt fit my low beams.	negative
Ordered this item, received peppermint instead of bergamot. No returns allowed so I ordered bergamot again and kept the original peppermint. 2nd order arrives ALSO PEPPERMINT instead of bergamot and it’s broken, coating my hands and the rest of my mail with peppermint. The kicker? It turned my fingers orange! Never ordering from this company again.	negative
Broken when it arrived. I was able to basically tape it together as it was the handle but it just doesn't work well	negative
These stockings already had a huge run in them when I opened them up. Otherwise they would have been great.	negative
I just got it today and I put some new battery in it and it’s not turning on at all.	negative
Beautiful shades but they are drying and do not apply well. Not worth the purchase.	negative
The back is so flimsy and does not provide any protection for the tablet. I returned it.	negative
Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out.	negative
Try to take it out from the case and it opens to the core. Try to contact the seller, never respond.	negative
Didn't work. Food not crisped at all - even though I tried multiple times raising both temperature and cook time.	negative
This what a bad choice for me. The pockets in these chair covers are cheaply made. The material is extra thin as you can see. I placed these on one of the folding chairs & as you can see it ripped due to the material being extra thin. They did however come on time as promised . I wish I would have made another choice. I don’t recommend these chair covers. I will be returning the Un open box of 50 that I wasn’t able to use.	negative
Do not purchase this toothbrush. There is a serious problem with the battery, we have to change it after only 2 weeks of normal use. And there is mold inside the toothbrush. Really disgusting!	negative
I received this bag today, it looks very cute and unique. However, be aware that the dimensions described are not right. The bag is very small, and likely would just fit your phone and the keys. Going to return it.	negative
3 in a row damaged upon delivery poor packaging dont waste your money until they fix this issue	negative
I ordered this product and they charged shipping that was just as much as the product itself!!! Then try and find someone to contact, yeah right. Got screwed again.	negative
Super disappointed. 4 out of the 6 were damaged like the one you see in the pictures. 2 of them didn’t even turn on. Had high hopes for these	negative
A lot smaller than I expected, couldnt use it. I gave it away. Good for kittens, not regular cats.	negative
My first one star review since 2012. Save the packaging if you already bought the garbage.	negative
Prettier in picture then in person	negative
Add me to the list of people that feel like they bought junk. Mine leaked all over inside the case also on the first use. Made a huge mess when I picked it up after the oil pumped out. Would not recommend.	negative
Be careful. This can be comfortable in s chair, but I wanted it for my car. It really jammed my lower back! I had to pull over to get it out from under me. What a waste!	negative
Arrived out of box, no seal. Pretty disappointed. It was a great price - guess I should of known better. Trashed it, didn’t want to use something that was already opened and or used. I’ll order directly from their site for safety.	negative
Great book. Terrible delivery. Came out of the package mangled. Not cool Amazon	negative
A total piece of crap!!! I bought it in June 2019, tested it when I got it, put it in a drawer. It sat there until now, end of October. When I needed it to use it, it's dead as a door nail! DO NOT TOUCH THIS ITEM!!!	negative
THE EXPEDITED SHIPPING CUTS ONE DAY OFF OF THE NORMAL SHIPPING!	negative
Fell off immediately	negative
I received an adidas tank top, not the makeup I ordered. I was skeptical of buying this makeup initially given that many people received the wrong makeup, but I was not even sent anything closely related to what I intended to buy.	negative
Don't waste you money, don't work	negative
The worst product I ever received from amozon... suction cup doesn't stick to any surfaces I tried to stick to I threw it in the trash can	negative
Terrible experience - table was cracked with a hole in it. All I requested was a new table and I'd pay the shipping. Was declined. I will not do business with this vendor ever again and would NOT recommend their product.	negative
Never received item. Money is gone!	negative
I needed the Catholic Bible I had gotten this one accidentally and They charged me for the return. Shame on them. It's the Holy Bible!	negative
This pot should be taken of the market immediately!!! You are guaranteed to get scolded when attempting to pour a cup of tea. The so called heat glove gives a false sense of security to the first time users which is why I felt obligated to stress how dangerous this teapot is! Do Not Buy This junk!	negative
Ordered for my husband. He hated it. Pillow is way too firm.	negative
I waste of my money.	negative
Smaller than described- description said AA batteries and it is actually AAA- broke after 2nd use	negative
"Value for this product was too good to be true... after using a 2018 15"" MacBook Pro with this, it seems to have overheated and melted. Didn't damage anything else fortunately, and surprisingly didn't blow a fuse, but it was really inconvenient to be quite literally out in the woods on a filming trip with no other way to power my laptop. I'd certainly pay double for a reliable product. I wasn't even using both ports simultaneously, only the USB-C port."	negative
Amazon says this filter fits my 2012 Corolla with the 1.8l engine. It does not. Totally too big. Maybe it fits the Camry.	negative
I just didn't like the construction	negative
These are nothing like the first bunch I bought. They don't stay lit. They barely smolder for more than 30 seconds. You have to stand right on top of them to get any scent!	negative
My dog will not touch this treat. Sniffed it and walked away. Wanted to return but says this item cannot be returned. One bag opened and didn’t eat one, other bag unopened and no return. Will not buy treats from Amazon in the future!	negative
what a waste, i put hot liquids( coffee) an hour or two is just warm, and before my shift is over is just room temperature, not a good one	negative
GARBAGE!, JUNK!, WASTE OF MONEY! DOES NOT STICK AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS EXTREMELY HARD TO GET IT TO TYPE	negative
Wouldn’t buy this. Half of the chargers in the 5 pack don’t work.	negative
This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable.	negative
Work for literally 2 days and then the screen turn black and never turn on again	negative
The protector it's too small!!!! is too narrow for the Honor 6X, it doesn't cover the whole screen!	negative
After one week color started to fade and the snap began to peel .wish I never bought it	negative
These socks are high quality but way too small!!	negative
Two cameras got stuck on night vision after only 2 weeks. Can’t return because they are used, plus we need something up!	negative
Ordered a 4 pack, waited almost 2 weeks for delivery. And then was sent the wrong item. Will be returning	negative
the fan stop working after almost a month of using it, tried to change the fuse it still doesn't work, my 10 dollar plastic fans are still running overpriced piece of shit!	negative
Had to buy different filters because these wouldnt work with CV carbs	negative
I smelled something burning, then realized this thing was shooting sparks. It had burnt and melted some of its components. Could have started the ceiling or wall on fire, it was shooting sparks pretty far. Totally broken now	negative
They never were delivered. Amazon refunded my money.	negative
Bought this in silver and black to try to make my hair softer and smoother. Cheap price too good to be true! Feels like very obvious fake silk. Returned immediately.	negative
They work great. Too great. My houseplants are drowning. There is no way to control the amount of water that syphon's into the pots.	negative
Love the necklace. One of my favorites. But it broke shortly after receiving it :(	negative
zipper broke off after 1st use. Poor quality.	negative
This bag got some water on it and the black ink/dye on the soccer ball started to bleed. This is unfortunate because I loved the item and was excited to use it for my toddler's food for our day trips. I cannot use this bag anymore as I am worried that dye will get on my child. I had black dye on my hands after touching it and it took a couple of days to rub off.	negative
This thing is a piece of crap and started falling apart a day after I put it on the phone. I'll find a better one at the dollar store.	negative
The power stake stopped working after about 2 weeks. I wrote and a nice person from Dewenwils emailed me right away and said they would send another and to verify my address. I have not received a new one and have written back several times. The do not respond. I need someone to rectify this or refund me. Please help!	negative
One works sometimes and the other one doesn’t work at all. Very disappointed. I bought these because my cat chews through regular cables. But I guess this won’t work either.	negative
Following thier sizing instructions and they don't come close to fitting properly.	negative
It’s a great idea and felt wonderful but the glove had torn already and I haven’t played more them. Few rounds and daily range practice with it I very disappointed	negative
Not good at all. Only worked the first week i only drink it 2x a day. After 1 week it started to give me constipation. I wanted a refund.	negative
the first pill about 2 hours latter i got a headache ...so i thought maybe i was getting a headache anyway after 3 in a row ...well it doesn't work for me !!!	negative
"I bought this so I could read outside. But too often when I swipe or click the ""next page"" button, I'm forwarded to some unknown destination in the book pages or even chapters ahead of where I was reading. Good luck finding where you were at because you have no idea how far in advance it forwarded you. It's so frustrating, I almost never use it."	negative
Dead on arrival... tried their batteries and our batteries. Neither worked. (All batteries checked at 1.5V and orientation of batteries was good.) Disappointing...	negative
Package came with a missing plate now the the whole case is useless. DO NOT BUY!	negative
Bought two sets of these lights to decorate a balcony with. Despite having both of them charging in the sun all day, they don’t stay lit for more than two or three hours. Doesn’t matter if you set them to blinking or leave them on steady; they won’t last more than a couple hours. Disappointing because they are pretty when they are working, but what’s the point if they’re supposed to be on throughout the night? Will be returning these.	negative
Was excited at first. But the first time he went to use it and switch the blades they don’t want to latch on. He hasn’t even been able to use it, and no heads will pop on.	negative
It has a problem grabbing the cards to shuffle them.	negative
Ordered this item for my infant during this cold weather! Item stated it was delivered but I never received. Customer service was not great about replacing item as that’s what I wanted instead of refund! Not happy with service at all!!!!	negative
If high quality sound is something you require then these ear buds are NOT for you. The ear buds do not hold charge longer than 30 minutes at best. Also, depending on the device you are connecting to, only one ear bud will work at a time. Overall I an not happy with this product and would spend the money and get the expensive ones.	negative
The survivor finale aired last night BUT it is available here on Amazon, even though I purchased the whole season!!!!!!! WHERE IS IT????????	negative
Used this on a sleeper couch with the couch mattress under the blow up mattress and it leaked the second night I used it, wasted my money	negative
The chain and such was to bulky and gawdy. The gold looked cheap.	negative
This broke apart after the first time we used it!	negative
Broken into several pieces and there is no return option.	negative
The wood was split down a wood seam when I got it out of the box and styrofoam. So, expensive, yet cheap.	negative
I bought it while I was I China, so I didn't get to use it right away. The first time I took it out of the box and used it, it didn't last more than 8 mins. I tried charging and that did nothing. I would like to contact the seller and try a new machine, but I can't find their contact info.	negative
Don't waste your money. Its a booklet at best.	negative
They are very pretty but they are not scented and are not soap. When wet they turn into a slimy glop. Not at all happy. I should've read the reviews better before purchasing.	negative
I bought this for a square five gallon bucket to take hunting with me. The straps were about 1.5 feet to short to strap around it and only came with one extra velcro extension and it was still not long enough with it. From the pictures of it holding large coolers, vacuums, etc i expected it to be fine for what i need. I guess ill have to rig up something else now for my hunting trips.	negative
This item simply didn't work well. The grinder is a joke. I wasted $30. Worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Wish I could return it.	negative
Broke the first day my daughter wore them.	negative
I have not received it thus far.	negative
Looks like the rating has gone down since I bought it, ah well... The screen protector went on well, but the black border of the protector covers up some of the phone's screen due to it not being big enough! Why are manufacturers adding these black borders if they cover up some of the screen? I didn't buy a nearly full-screen phone to have it covered back up by the protector. Also, I've had a bit of trouble getting the OnePlus to read my fingerprint to sign in since installing it.	negative
I found this book to be boring and a complete waste of time. Save your money and attention. Don't buy this book.	negative
Not exactly original equipment. Similar but not the same as the originals. Not that pleased. The photo made it look like the original. They were not at all like the originals.	negative
I ordered a horse and they delivered me a mule. The colors on the case were all wrong, nothing like the case in the picture.	negative
It is so very thin and see through. Material is cheap and my finger poked right though it. Very disappointed. Won't buy again.	negative
Literally last 1 day. I only put it on him when he is in the house not outside and the thread that holds the ribbon around the bow came out. I will never purchase from here again. Such a simple product yet can't be made with quality.	negative
I am very disappointed with this product. I bought the charging pad to use on my bedside table for overnight charging. But the blue charging light stays on all night, is super bright and distracting. Apparently they don’t allow returns - like most items I buy on Prime. Cheaply made and not well thought out. I don’t recommend it for anyone looking for a charging pad.	negative
The pump does not work.	negative
Have never recieved the product. Had zero communication with vendor thats even after I emailed them twice. No way to run a business	negative
Product did not charge in sun and plug in doesn’t work. Never got to fully charge it. To late to return.	negative
These suck! Died after maybe 10 uses over the course of 2 months. I gave one star because they wouldn't let me submit zero.	negative
No support at all, don't waste you're money!	negative

I bought this book but it was never delivered even though it says it was. I'm unable to get my money back from Amazon.	negative
Didn't even stick to my phone! Waste of money!	negative
It doesn't sit flat on a smooth glass burner. This means food burns in the middle while being barely warmed around the sides. Very annoyed.	negative
I was informed it arrived I got all the other items but not this the hoverboard case was the only thing missing	negative
This is the spiciest gum I have ever tried. It burnt my mouth. Have it to a friend and she loved it.	negative

Two of the four ink cartridges were empty no ink.	negative
I bought this headset some point last year as a backup for my main headset, It worked originally upon me testing it. I recently used it and the mic has a ton of interference. If I could return it I would because it's horrible.	negative
Bigger than I expect	negative
Very disappointed it was broken when I received it so I had to return it. It was the only thing in the box no wrapping or anything to keep it from braking. The colors where pretty I wish I could have actually used it. Nervous to purchase another one because I don’t want to have to send that back too.	negative
These cables are junk. After 6 months, all three have failed and will no longer charge our phones. Amazon would not take them back and told us to contact the manufacturer.	negative
Stopped rotating after 3 weeks...	negative
DONT.BUY.THESE. We bought them for Halloween AND NONE OF THEM WORKED. 0 out of 100 worked. Waste of money.	negative

these were VERY tiny, super cheap and the color was smeared, bought as a Christmas present - threw them away.	negative
I did exactly what the package said to do and it didn't even dry after 24 hours and everything fell off this is crap dont waste your money	negative
I bought this for a Christmas present, my kids tried to play it and one of the buttons does not work. Very disappointing! It says it is past the return window so I'm out the money I spent. Also I have all boys, so why does it only have one boy and one girl face? They should be reversible and have a boy on one side and girl on the other.	negative
Sealing doesn't work!	negative
I am so disappointed to have bought this heating pad. Beside it not heating well at all, it stopped working. I tried unplugging it and used other outlets, with no success.. I have used other heating pads that have lasted me for years. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND.	negative
Horrible!! Do not waste your money. They will not stay on.	negative
I buy Frankincense essential oil from another company for years. I decided to try this cause of a better price. I'm returning it. This is NOT Frankincense and not an essential oil. it's some kind of a foul smelling chemical.	negative

Was happy to receive it and put lots of effort putting it up... looks great initially, however the bulbs on three strings burnt out after only two days (was on only for a few hours).

Product came damaged :(	negative
Product does not work, iPhone keeps saying that accessory is not compatible with iPhone.	negative

Cracked within a day	negative
Apparently you need some other part to make this work. Returned. Logitech mouse is far easier and better price.	negative
Product came in with the zipper broken. Emailed seller and NEVER GOT A RESPONSE!!!!	negative
Buy Spectra original parts. The backflow protectors pop off constantly. And the Spectra pumping bottles don't secure to the flanges at all. They don't provide a tight fit. These are not at all worth it. Buy Spectra brand.	negative
Not only did it leak as others have noted, but when I tried to open it, the rivets popped out! Been using other pans for years - never happened before. Complete waste of money. Had to trash it after one use.	negative

This item was cheap & I should have been suspicious. It doesn’t use USA batteries. You have to order rechargeable batteries & charger from China. $20 more & didn’t ship for a month. No thanks. I’m returning it.	negative
The tie was not with the robe	negative

I had to rent another Modem after having this one connected for just a few months. Buy the latest model recommended by the carrier. We have Xfinity and I was told this model is excellent, but the wifi never worked well; either it was too old a model or really had a defect, I will never know. I bought it refurbished.	negative

I bought a six pack of this product, but three of them were a different kind of deodorant I don’t use.	negative
"You would expect it will last longer than 1.5 years when you paid $600+ for a camera. Mine prompted ""Camera Error Turn Power Off Then On"" in the middle of vacation and never recover and Sony wants me to pay $200+ to send it for diagnostic minus the parts & labor. Looks like I will never buy Sony ever again and I will make sure all my friends & families stay out of SONY. Stay away or you might have to buy extended warranty for this crappy product."	negative
Not sure what happened to my steampunk but this is all I got in the bag	negative
The item arrived wet inside the plastic bag in which it was wrapped (obviously used and not new as described), and it had pieces of human hair inside the tray on which the coffee mug sits. I have yet to test the product to see if it works.	negative

I bought the product twice and both times within 5 minutes the piece broke in half with part of it stuck in door!	negative
Didn’t get product in a tub like it shows... it was 2 seal bags and it didn’t look the same	negative
Not at all comfortable rides up	negative
seems good time will tell. UPDATE. gone off twice, that's ok. but couldn't reset by button or turn off. Had to remove back panel and screw, unhook negative side of battery. A real pain. Buy an APC.	negative
I had high hopes for this. 4 weeks of use and still only pumping 1/2 oz total 😭 didn’t work at all.	negative
I ordered this in June and was meant to receive it in August. The carriers say they delivered it but I haven’t seen it. Contacted the seller via email and I have received no response. That’s not good customer service. I just sent them another mail. I bought this cos of the excellent reviews I saw here. Not impressed with this one bit.	negative
It was not what I was looking, it was not the Pittsburgh Steelers own app.	negative
This thing doesn't fit over a standard US faucet aerator, which probably accounts for more than half of all the customers that are trying to use this. If I could give this product a zero I would. Not only is it not universal, but it fails to meet the most common need of its potential users.	negative
It didn't fit my phone	negative
It didn’t last one winter. It tore, and was brittle by spring.	negative
It was great for about 3 days and then it broke. Stick with name brands.	negative
Dont believe all the FAKE REVIEWS its a waste of time I tried them all, the only way to stop all the wrinkles and sheets coming out from the sides is by attaching the long straps that go horizontally and vertically from one end to the other end, these corner straps are a joke, you still wake up uncomfortable with wrinkles all over cause the sheets have no pull where its needed and that is in the center.	negative
This film was so slow and uneventful it deserves to be listed only as a lullaby! The acting was brutally amateurish and the script was something a four year old would write. The other reviews that are anything above a two star are obviously from people associated with its production. Don't waste your time.	negative
I love these, but #12 and #13 arrived broken. Didn’t realize and now I’m less than 2 weeks til my wedding and will have to spend more money on new ones. If I could receive new ones of those numbers I would be satisfied with that but I don’t see a way to contact the seller, which is disappointing.	negative
It worked for like half a song.	negative
First use on July 3, 2018 in readiness for Fourth of July get together. September 3, 2018 it stopped working. Replaced batteries and it won't work. The blue light indicates when powered On, however, the light won't stay lit. It will flash when On/Off button pressed, otherwise no light, no operation. The unit needs a redesign so moisture or soap doesn't leak into the battery compartment corroding the connections. It's very attractive, but useless if it doesn't do anything. :(	negative
For the price the glue wasn’t every strong very disappointed.	negative
This is not what I order it looks like for a puppy deceiving they are not big it’s like 3 inches and they are not think	negative
I bought 3 as stocking stuffers for my family for Christmas and a well or two later it stopped working. Very disappointing. I was hoping it would be great for the kids to use while multitasking but unfortunately I was wrong	negative
Gets knotted quickly. Doesn’t look like the picture at all.	negative
Material seems to be good, but came apart after a few uses.	negative
Materials are cheap and see through. Held together by a light stitch, so easily comes apart. I wish I wouldve saved my money. Bought this for my Florida honeymoon and it just hangs in my closet. Eventually I will send it to the Salvation Army.	negative
Not the full length of your eyelid	negative
I order lot’s of stuff from Amazon and this one just slipped my mind. Ordered these Cones about 3 months ago. Item showed delivered but I never received them. It’s too late to make a claim with Amazon so I lost the $12 I paid for them plus I didn’t get the cones.	negative
failed after six months . Warranty replacement is impossible so far !	negative
The socks run extremely small and are so tight that they are difficult to get on. The MED socks (chose based on size chart) are tight on a woman's 7 1/2 shoe size foot and much too small for a man's 9 shoe size foot.	negative
Did absolutely nothing for me at all	negative
I ordered the over 6 weeks ago and I still don't have it	negative
not at all what was advertised	negative
I didn’t want to write a review cause I’m giving time to see if is working or not.	negative
Wrong item sent! As w/ other reviewers, I ordered 4 brush heads but got 3 brush heads +cleanser! Seller posted 4 week’s ago that they had corrected problem & correct item would be sent in the future....well problem is NOT FIXED	negative
I bought it for my mother's Walker it will not stay on and falls off cell is very uncooperative would not recommend them	negative
For one the cap over heats. How can u hold some to your Vagina that over heats. Secondly I can’t turn it off it says 2-3 seconds and it goes off but it doesn’t. My last complaint is that the vibrations are too soft. Unless the one I received is broken or the button don’t work it doesn’t change speed. Highly disappointed	negative
It us too hard to get the fruit infuser out of the bottle.	negative
The design is lovely, but it is crudely made. The bottom is very thin and badly deformed. Very disappointed.	negative
The bras were so cheaply made. Had to return them	negative
I didn’t buy this???	negative
1 is not good to use.There is no sound insulation.And it's very expensive.It still doesn't work if you try to place a different position.	negative
It is a great size for a 2 or 3 year old but the zipper came apart after just 2 uses. This is one of the things I dislike about amazon..... I ordered this ahead of time for our trip... And now that the trip has arrived and we only now find out that the zipper is broken there's nothing I can do about it to get return to replaced since I Ordered it ahead of time in preparation.	negative
Only for extremely small suvs. It was way to small for my Ford Edge.	negative
These markers are either fake or used. Very disappointed with this product.	negative
Absolute junk. Do not buy this scope, the internals are complete junk.	negative
hose too small for water pressure. Blew out my water line.	negative
One of 3 batteries came broken. The company wants us to mail it back that in it's broken condition. Guess what, FedEx or UPS won't ship a broken battery as it's forbidden cargo. This company tanks high on the worst customer service. Stear clear of first web sales. You've been warned.	negative
NEVER RECEIVED, seller will not reply....still states in transit!	negative
I ordered according to their size chart; there is no compression at all. You also cannot return them.	negative
I don't like writing bad reviews. This case is HORRIBLE. The magnets will not snap into my tablet. Even if they did, the design is poor. It's difficult to use for any function one might want to use it for... reading, video watching, web surfing etc. I'm returning it immediately!	negative
Quality of the sunglasses don’t match up with the price. The lens looks flimsy and the frame is uneven.	negative
This does not do its job what so ever. It does not collect lint or hair.	negative
first of all there no strecth to the leggings and on top of that they are see thru they fit weird and are not comfty i return them dont waste your money on these	negative
Cute bottle, horrible product	negative
trash!!! not working ... don't loose your money.	negative
The shirt is NOT long at all. It does not fit like the advertised photo at all. The color is correct, that’s about it. I’m 5’7, 145 and ordered a large hoping it would be longer.. it is very wide and comes to my belt buckle. If I lift my arms my stomach will show.	negative
Ordered in black and very disappointed to open it and it was red	negative
I used these once and then threw them away. The first problem was that they didn't work (they didn't absorb sweat at all). Then when I washed them in the washing machine, they practically fell apart. These had good reviews, so I was optimistic and bought 2 pair instead of trying out with just one first. That was a mistake. I would not order these again. At all.	negative
worked 1year at most, then you throw it away	negative
I bought the steak and chicken for my Brussels Griffon, she tried one of each and she will not eat them again. She doesn’t like them. They really have no smell to them and they look dry and hard. Wasted my money. She does love her dental bone from Wilderness. She gets one every morning. Now... it looks like a real bone.	negative
Made from low quality materials. Very disappointed.	negative
Worked fine for short uses but fell asleep with the fan on and now it no longer works only the light. Very upsetting, I’ve had it only a few weeks too	negative
Loved the look of these hand towels but after a few washes the seems are coming out. They are now garage rags. Disappointing!!!	negative
I have not received this item today	negative
Worked horribly. Cut jagged not clean at all and yes I used it correctly. Not happy had to redo vinyl on my hood.	negative
It had a broken valve that I fixed but the product itself may have already lost it holding. It does not work	negative
Bought this thinking that it would work based off of the reviews. Starting clogging up on me. Unfortunately, it's passed the window to return. I should've bought a Bissell.	negative
I ordered a small, outside package says small. But the inside product clearly says xs.	negative
Too bad you can’t give them zero stars. All of them don’t work anymore and I have only used each one about 4 times. They are horrible and break fast. Do not buy.	negative
Not happy at all. False advertisement. Only plays one song. Does not play fully through. No mint bow. Not at all what is described.	negative
I have called back the same day i received it and got a return shipment and today I am still waiting to pick this up to get my return..	negative
Received wrong color	negative
Stated that the length was approximately 24 inches. It's nowhere near 24 inches.	negative
Very cheap considering the price. It broke in less than a day.. I recommend not to even waste your money on this.	negative
Honestly for what i paid i expected a better radio....very disappointed it sounds like crap and to change radio station it is like the 1990 alarm clocks. u roll it with ur thumb for that and volume. Also there is no base/treble button and its all static	negative
I don't know if the formula has changed, but this product irritates my eyes... I've been using this for years and haven't had any problems except for this time...	negative
I ordered the part to fit my Heavy Duty Kitchenaid mixer. However, when it arrived it would not fully attached to the mixer peg. The hole narrowed at the bottom and would not lock into the stand mixer. Would not work so I had to return it.	negative
I would like a new bottle this one was open someone Twisted the seal	negative
So sure enough after my 90 day return window this speaker won’t charge anymore. So another defective Bluetooth speaker to add to the mountain of shoddy electronic devices that seem to quit working after a few months. BUYER BEWARE!!	negative
The curtain rod keeps falling as the tension does not keep it place.	negative
Product didn't seem to either heat or cool...we were not happy with this purchase	negative
I have ordered this many times and the product I received this time was completely different. The color is way off (yellow/cream versus medium/light brown). This time it is greasy and difficult to wash off. Plus, the exfoliating beads are large. Guessing I received a fake product!	negative
Never received my order, took forever to respond to my messages.	negative
I think they were not adequate. Much too sunlight got through. Burned a lot.	negative
Disappointing lock quality. One of the keys only works on 3 locks, and the other key on 3 locks. So if you want to be able to open all the locks you have to carry both keys. The lock mechanism seems to be loose in the lock body as well.	negative
Terrible. Didn’t hold air from the jump. Waited a few days and it still wouldn’t even hold all the air for more than 10 minutes. And Oh good luck trying to get it back into the Tiny box it comes in if you want to return it ! The box ended up ripping open at the seams, I ended up throwing the whole thing out	negative
Material is of very poor quality. Don't worth buying	negative
cheap...I thought I was getting a form compressed blue fiber filter...nope..very holey ..I had to buy another kind to trap dirt...these do not trap anything...I'm going to send to my recycle bin	negative
Does not fit any of the 5 walkers we have. Will tip forward or back I had to clean up ensure in palce's it should have never been.	negative
I ordered a new replacement touch screen digitizer to replace my cracked screen in my Note 10.1. First one came in SHATTERED! Returned it got a second one turns out that was defective also I guess. S Pen works but no finger recognition. NO GOOD!	negative
I followed the clean instructions and it still was sticking bad. I’m totally disappointed.	negative
Purchased product late April, received THE WRONG PRODUCT (without the sour cream and herbs) late May. My suggestion,,, Stay away from this vendor. p.s. would rate 0 stars if possible.	negative
Bought 2 and one does not work turns off then turns off would like a replacement.	negative
order this just open it up and theirs scratches on every peace and there are missing parts as i show you in the photos i want my money back.... I ORDER THIS PRODUCT BRAN NEW NOT USED WITH MISSING PARTS ... BOX WAS DAMAGED AS WELL this review is for the proof for amazon to review issue my money back !!!	negative
I ordered this because of the gold rose BUT when i finally got it oh surprise it looks like an ugly gold color. Extremely disappointed	negative
After using the turn signal both strips get stuck on amber color and randomly switch back to white. They worked as intended a few times and then started to get stuck. Waste of time and money	negative
Cute but it's really something you can get out of the bubble gum machine necklace broke and I've only had for 2 weeks	negative
these are misleading. if your beam is taller than the spoke provided, there's nothing for these hooks to anchor onto. I ended up getting a screw-in hook and attaching my own carabiners	negative
Purchased this December 2017, and it stopped working January 2018. I would not recommend purchasing this device. The manufacturer doesn't list this item on their official website. Consequently, they don't seem to offer any warranty, or publish warranty information.	negative
I love the idea and how easy they were to use But one the clip broke with in hours of using it I was able to replace the hook with one I bought at the store	negative
"Awful. Not what was described. Don't look like the picture at all. Maybe 4"" tall tops no arms and no wire in the hat or with the Nordic pattern that was in the description."	negative
The white does not work and they sent two of the same color not happy with product	negative
It's bland and under done	negative
This case is BEAUTIFUL BUT THE BOTTOM PART IS TOOOO HARD and it has broken 2 chargers already.. one piece is now left inside my phone and now I have to PAY to fix it. DO NOT BUY IT. If you decide to buy it anyway.. cut the bottom part. The little cover for your charger.. CUT THAT PART!!	negative
Ordered 5 or 6 weeks ago. Never received.	negative
Cheap quality. Stitching came all jagged, and the fabric is very thin.	negative
Bought a set came with a remote, and was not capable of bluetooth. They replaced the box and after being installed it lasted 2 hours. No refund. poor product quality and not worth the money you pay if it never was fully functional from the beginning.	negative
This clock kept gaining time do not buy!!	negative
Doesn’t work at all so there was no point in even using it	negative
It doesn't even connect to my smartphone! But without smartphone it is absolutely useless.	negative
The bottle felt like it Was only 1/4 of the way full when I received it! It also did nothing to help with any pain! Waste of money!	negative
Using Bruce willis as a star in this movie suckered me into getting it. He was just window dressing	negative
Not able to get it to play and I have purchased it	negative
I’m very disappointed. The bottle is cute but it stopped working after one week. It no longer sprays out water.	negative
Not quality I’ve purchase before	negative
I like the color but its so cheep the moment I pulled it out it broke.	negative
Won't come out of tube wouldn't stick to face very well either	negative
There were holes in the seam of the rear end of these leggings and you can’t return them. Wish I realized there was no returns, shame on me for not looking and shame on them for not offering	negative
I bought this for my craftsman trimmer which is listed in the product description. Changed carb and it didnt work. Spent some time trying to adjust high and low but nothing worked. Do not buy.	negative
We tried two tv's from this company and both had to be returned with in a few days. First we ordered the 22in and the sound went out completely 30 minutes into a movie. We returned that and ordered the 24in with a sound bar. This time we made it through one movie and a couple days later we turned it on to find no sound at all, again! Now we are returning a second and will NOT be purchasing from this company again.	negative
I got a defective one	negative
Not even one year later and none of the cords are working.	negative
Doesnt work. I think it actually attracts the fleas to the collar as I have had it on my cats for three days and no dead fleas. Losts of the fleas were near the collar. Frustrated as this did not work	negative
Shipped wrong item.... But I was refunded all cost	negative
It absolutely did not fit my son's S5. They are quick to send a replacement, but now I have sent both cases back, and I have not received a replacement. I cannot figure out how to get a hold of anyone.	negative
The seller had asked me to post pictures of the damaged item.	negative
I didn't like how these fit my daughter. She simply bend down to pet our dog, and split right in the crotch within an hour of opening them.	negative
This spray is either outdated or fake. It irritated my skin which turned bright red which never happens with the store bought version of this. Please see attached photo of store bought versus ordered on amazon. Buyer beware!	negative
Description says it's ultrasonic. It is not. If you want an ultrasonic whistle do not buy.	negative
Ruined and dried out my hair. Brought into my salon and different color and smell. Don't buy.	negative
These hide-a-lines are absolute garbage. The plastic is cheap it flakes off as you attempt to attach them together. The screws strip out every time you attempt to use them. This product made a rough job even harder. I wish I had time to return them but I have to continue using them...	negative
I guess I misread the description because I saw that it was 2 baskets. I was shocked when only one arrived. I would never have paid $45 for 1 basket. I chose this because I am disabled and I thought that this basket would make laundry day easier. I can't return it because there is no way I can haul around the huge box it came in. I feel stuck with it and angry that you charge $45 for 1 laundry basket.	negative
I was so excited about this...arrived packed well and then it broke in two seperate very important places in the first month! I think the plastic its made of us simply low quality, sucks too because its such a huge piece of plastic to be wasting now and it had a cool stabilizer and the feet were solid 🙁	negative
has visible damage to pins.	negative
Too small for 1-1/2 year old	negative
If I could give this 0 stars I would. It’s not at all what we ordered. Needed these cupcake rings for my daughters birthday party tomorrow and instead I am left with breast pump and breast milk accessory micro steam bags. Wtf.	negative
These are thin and they fall apart would not recommend to anyone	negative
I was looking forward to being able to change the color of the light but unfortunately that function is not available. The light was however easy to connect to Alexa and is nice not having to require a hub. Now that I’ve had these a few weeks it really bothers me that they are not as advertised. I thought I would get used to the color but the longer I have them the more it irritates me. I’m going to have to look for another brand.	negative
This thing is horrible, I thought it was strong, powerful, reliable. The cord seemed strong and it wouldn't crack or break up. Thats not the case, Its just a casing, it can still tangle up from inside, and the volume part in the middle broke off the wire. Absolute garbage, don't buy this non-sense. I should have bought those more expensive head phones with better return policy, im at a loss with this one.	negative
Never received the item.	negative
There was a bunch of top names missing and or spelled wrong	negative
Didn't have it ten minutes before it broke. As soon as I tried attaching it to the spigot it snapped in two.	negative
The product stopped working after a couple of months.	negative
I am a photographer that depends on batteries to make a living. This is frustrating because the charger seems fairly well designed, but obviously has electrical problems.	negative
Never received this item!	negative
Love the earrings. But the left earring was bent. I am worried that it will break after putting it on after awhile.	negative
Awful, awful material. Polyester. Feels TERRIBLE to the touch. Had to throw them away. I would not recommend these to my enemy. I know I have already said awful but I will again just in case you didn't completely get it: they're AWFUL.	negative
I bought two of these and NEITHER of them worked. I have a ball python that has a heat mat under his terrarium that works perfectly. I plugged both in programmed it to my desired temperature and left it in for a 24 hour period. The heat in the terrarium never got about 72 degrees F. This is extremely upsetting as I said neither of the two worked and my return window has already closed so I’m stuck with $50 worth of useless heat controllers.	negative
It was super baggy in all the wrong places... oddly not too big, just bagged so much that it didn't effectively cover all of the parts that should be covered. I guess you get what you pay for :/	negative
Been using a few weeks now and no changes	negative
Makes my super sensitive skin chemical burn even when following the directions to a T. Only used once then had to recover for 2 weeks from some sort of skin burn reaction.	negative
My son has been loved the product, however we have not owned it for two months yet, and the clip has broken. Very cheap. Very irritated. Amazon should send a new one.	negative
Blows very mild air at first then eventually stopped working effectively. Money wasted.	negative
Computer stopped working after plugging this in. As soon as I plugged it in and booted, my PC when into a disk failed state. Uninstalling did not fix this. Took me 2 hours of diagnosis and disk repair to get my computer working again.	negative
Item arrived in box with no padding. The part of the case that connects to the hose was broken off. Returned item, still waiting for refund.	negative
A nice paperback, like most Penguin Classics, however my copy had a large tear across almost the entire back cover. I would return it, except that I need the book immediately and don’t have time to wait. A partial refund would be nice.	negative
I bought this product hoping that the other reviews about this product cracking and not removing hair were wrong. Well this product cracks if the layer applied is not SUPER thick. Even if applied generously it still cracked and caused a bigger hassle to remove. Needless to say I returned this product.	negative
Wtf it’s just an empty box...I thought gag gift meant that it was just a stupid gift, not that there isn’t any gift at all	negative
This movie is dreadful. I usually don't write reviews after watching movies but this one inspired me to hopefully deter anyone wanting to watch it from wasting their time. No stars!	negative
The numbers were very hard for the kids to read. (It needs to have a different font) I would not buy it again.	negative
Loved the look of this but it was too tall so I had to send it back	negative
Doesn't work like they say on TV	negative
I wanted this to work so bad because of the price but sadly it did not. I started using it on August 5th and have been using it every single day. I dont see no new growth at all. It was a waste of money for me.	negative
One of the corner reinforcements and grommet fell off when we unfolded the tarp. Company gave us a full refund.	negative
It will NOT boot up. I bought insurance from Amazon.. For crying out loud. I think it is hopeless.	negative
It wouldn’t seal on the outer edge of my iPhone7 so I took it off and threw it away.	negative
Junk, after less than 2 months it freezes up to where the only thing the standby button ( which controls most operations ) just dims or brightens the display, a function it's not supposed to do.. Too late to send back..Stay away..	negative
I ordered this specifically for the thin red line ring. The original order did not have the red but two of the silver lines. I called amazon to get it fixed. They sent the same exact item with no thin red line ring. Called Amazon again and they couldn’t figure out a solution.	negative
Very upset , attempted to use for my baby shower and they came slashed. Never buying again.	negative
Bought this as a Christmas present and the remote did not work with the droid, was sent a second one and it had the same issue. I do not recommend this to anyone.	negative
Not what I ordered. What I received was not even a backpack, more like a lunchbox duffle bag. Can't use it for everyday use as needed so I am returning.	negative
Neither cord works after the first charger	negative
It not like the picture in person it looks like a regular tshirt.	negative
Don’t but. This is very uncomfortable and it was in the garbage can by the end of the day. The fabric had a butch of small perforated holes (it is the style) and the skin would “try to leak out” of it making it super uncomfortable within the hour.	negative
Quality is okay but there not 5 yards long!	negative
I never received the items	negative
Worst set of tools I have purchased from Amazon. For $13, I expected a lot better quality. The 0.8mm pin was out of the holder. I had to fix this with a vice before it was usable. The other 3 pins where bent. If you don’t want to fix these tools before you can use them, buy something else. I bought an other set for half this price from Amazon and they are a lot better. No way would I give this as a gift.	negative
I guess I’ll be lucky to get one Christmas out of the tree. I didn’t plan on it being disposed after one use	negative
Very thin, size small the arms are short.	negative
They still have yet to arrive. Super disappointed because I needed for a project.	negative
I bought three of them and 2 of them broken already.	negative
Product arrived stale and chewy. Should be crunchy. Old. I had to throw away.	negative
I've tried this thing for a few days and I'm shocked. First night there were none. The second day I checked periodically and saw 3 stuck on it. Ok cool. The next time I checked they were all gone.... wait what?! Then I watched one of these tricky little creeps get stuck upsidedown, do a back bridge out of the stickiness until he flipped over on his legs and JUMPED OFF THE STICKY PAD! I'm flabbergasted. Useless. Make your pads stickier! And yes I removed the film.	negative
First of all, there are NOT 24 cans - there are only 8. Secondly, the paints do NOT glow in the dark, even after leaving them in the sun for days. Waste of money. Don't bother.	negative
Lasted 3 months. Cheap ceramic spacers cracked causing coil to short to case. DO NOT BUY!	negative
Within 1 year, was leaking, gaping holes.	negative
Zippers are horrible. The bags were ok. The pouches zippers are better but I am treating them with extra TLC. I threw out the packing bags right in the hotel. The zippers were off the track right upon delivery. I fixed them but they do not zip smoothly. Too much trouble. Very annoying because when you’re in the road for six weeks, you want to be organized.	negative
It took two months for the package to arrive, when I finally got it the succulent was almost completely dead. Hopefully I can get it to survive once I plant it.	negative
Package arrived EMPTY!!!	negative
I don't normally write reviews but this was bad. As soon as I opened the bag it smelled terrible. Once I held the toothbrush it caused me to gag. It smelled as if it had been dead for 2 weeks. I am not even joking. Tried boiling it for 10 min with no success. There is no way I would give this to my dog. It smells much worse.	negative
It sheds like crazy... I don’t know about other people. But It is definitely too rough on my skin.	negative
It arrived in bad condition! It was bent in many places. Very unhappy	negative
This product worked ok when I first got it but there was always feed back. I’ve had it 2 months now and it no longer works at all. Waste of money.	negative
Disappointed!! I loved the colors -so pretty. But as others reviewed, the product is smelly, sticks, dries like glue with burning sensation on lips. Don’t buy and if used, coconut oil is your rescue!!!	negative
They sent me wrong item.	negative
I never write reviews but I just had to in this case. I bought this over a month ago for a birthday gift. Friend opened it yesterday and it appears that the bottle was damaged or defective because 1/3 of the perfume leaked out and stained all the tissue paper and carton. Very embarrassed to give such a gift.	negative
My mother taught me that if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all!	negative
2001 dodge dakota. Installed fine but not bright at all. Pretty well useless.	negative
Does not hold air. Have to inflate every use	negative
These cords do not fit Android phones and are too fat for Apple. Basically the are useless. Product cost 10 bucks and the return fee is 6 bucks. Not worth the trouble of returning. Just don't buy.	negative
This product looks nice in the picture but is very cheap looking in person. The candle was even junky plastic. It's way overpriced for a low quality product.	negative
This product is absolutely bullshit. You can not even grab a cookie sheet out of the oven that has been baking at 350 degrees without getting burned. You could pretty much put on a pair of winter gloves and be better off. A complete and utter waste of money. Extremely disappointing! The description states 932 degrees F????!!!!	negative
I ordered the solid blue and received a blue with gray cuffs and bottom band. I really don’t like the look. It took forever to arrive and is not worth the hassle to return, so it’s going straight to the giveaway bin.	negative
This really works makes you Eat less. Drink lots of water with it.	negative
Couldn't get it to work. Maybe I didn't understand the rules correctly. Never played before. Deleted	negative
I needed a new mouse, did my research and decided this mouse was perfect....until it stopped working after 3 months. I was very disappointed and unfortunately couldn’t return it so I’m stuck with a mouse that doesn’t work and have to buy another one.	negative
This shirt is absolutely terrible & does not look at all like the picture. I should have known better.	negative
Save your money, not long after you pay full unlock the game freezes and you can't go anywhere.should get refund.	negative
The scent is way too overpowering.	negative
Product is great, but I ordered 9 of these all came in 9 different bags	negative
Took one tiny sip of this chalk and was left drinking half a gallon of water hydrating what I puked out	negative
Does not come with screws to fit, cannot use screws from existing window(to short), cannot purchase the correct screws due to irregular size.	negative
This is poorly made. After 2 uses for international travel, the areas around the wheels on 2 of them cracked making them stand and wheel unevenly which made them a hassle to commute. Cannot be used anymore.	negative
I bought this item with very high hopes. I inoperable the box, use the tap measure function and the metal piece breaks completely off. It then retracted back into the device and is no unusable. The laser light itself should be in a fix position and it’s difficult to relabel it. The instructions are poorly written and does not cover set up. Avoid this item if possible	negative
Tedious to put together.	negative
Stopped working after 4 months.	negative
I was looking for play rings...but these are unbelievably poorly made. Most gems broke off when unpacking and it’s like the ring is just a pressed thin tin. Very cheaply made. Do not recommend.	negative
This was a waste of money. Wouldn’t stay on my son’s wall. We tried multiple times to get this to stick and it would fall down within 30 min.	negative
I was so excited about this dryer and straightener and could not unpackage it fast enough. Took it out, plugged it in and it started smoking and sparking and almost caught my hair on fire. I have never in my life purchased a product that was so dangerous, could have been a lemon but I would never purchase this brand again. Spent a few more dollars on the revlon version and soooo much better and quality is better!!	negative
Walmart can ship these in AZ without them melting. To bad Amazon can't.	negative
I was hoping for a really sharp well sharpened saw. the teeth are totally irregularly sharpened, some bent over a little and it just doesn't cut worth shit.	negative
Sending it back. I did not like the quality of the printed birds on it. Looked cheap. So I bought the quilt instead, which was better. Not sure if it's the material that was used for the comforter. Back ground of comforter is also darker than the pictures,	negative
This soccer ball was for my eight year old son. However, I received the wrong size. So it’s sitting on the counter unused.	negative
All the brightness began to fall immediately, what a shame that they put on sale such a poor quality product	negative
I havnt been able to put together product due to no screws plastic locks and wheels	negative
If I could give it a zero I would. It’s a piece of thin cotton fabric with a string attached. It is cheap, but still a waste of a few dollars. The picture is NOT the product you get.	negative
Bought key chain as a gift. Very pretty, a little too big but it was nice. Felt apart in a week. Would not recommend.	negative
I ordered this for my husband, we have been having trouble conceiving and decided this would be a nice place to begin checking into our fertility. We are anxious to begin and get the results, he does the test 100% direction by direction and the test cake back inconclusive. Nothing read up on the test window. After all of that hassle and paying for the product, it didnt even work. Were both incredibly disappointed.	negative
They are super nice but broke as we hung them. Not in one place but all the places	negative
Three cans arrived opened, product had dried out, unable to use.	negative
Pooly packaged, 3 quarts of oil in a thin ziplock bag, shipped in white FedEx bubble envelope. Item appears to have been crushed and blew open oil of the quarts of oil in the bag. The sise seam of the ziplock bag failed. The envelop was partially filled with oil which saturated the contents and left a stain on the porch where it was delivered.	negative
I bought one color by mistake that unfortunately will not work on my hair after reading everything on the Pravana website & am unable to return even though the package was never opened. I also bought everything the Pravana website said I would need for my dark hair and followed their instructions EXACTLY and I’m not even going to show you what the end result was. Needless to say I will NOT use these products ever again!!	negative
Everytime it was connected to '03 rx300 to reset airbag light, this equipment triggered 2 new traction lights TRAC OFF and VSC, and could not reset them !!!	negative
Arrived with the cap off and soap all over the product and inside its packaging. Don't know how much was wasted because of the leaking.	negative
One of the bottles of polish broke during shipping. It's not salvageable - glass is glued to the plastic packaging by the dried up polish. The bottle that broke was the specific color that I ordered this kit to use. There are no returns on this product so that's unfortunate.	negative
Not a good buy! Only Bright with the Charger in.	negative
Movie was a waste of time for me. Thank goodness for fast foward.	negative
It is unusable. I put it in a drawer. someday, my heirs will be cleaning out this drawer and wonder what the heck I was thinking, and also what the heck it is.	negative
All three quit working less than a week of having. I didn’t bother returning...just tossed	negative
Would like to give a zero. Can’t use it on my Nintendo switch	negative
This reads like a first draft. 1. The characters are static, 2. The villains' motivations are not well thought out, 3. The setting is somehow both bland and overdone, 4. The pacing is rushed towards the end. It feels like the author got tired of writing and just slapped together an ending. This is the second book ever that I will take the time to completely remove from my Amazon account, not just delete from my device.	negative
Not impressed. I didn't notice a difference. A really expensive attempt. But I'm glad we gave it a try.	negative
Id put zero stars if I could. Every one of the balloons pooped before we used them. I had them in little pools with water and filled them up and they werent just deflated but actually popped before the kids came out to play. Dont waste your money.	negative
Broke within few days.	negative
So disappointed with Amazon! I ordered this Bug Joe chair for my daughters dorm room, all my daughter received was a plain plastic bag of refill beans! Call to fix it and found out the item is no longer in stock. I did get a refund but still really dissappinted.	negative
I can't believe this movie got so many good ratings. What a waste of my time.	negative
Started and idled fine but runs out out of fuel when put under load.	negative
I failed to read all the reviews. These are too wide to put on a breadboard and use all the pins. The NodeMCU are way better.	negative
I would like to review this item unfortunately it NEVER arrived!	negative
I would love to write a review, however, I never received my order.	negative
This item is a waste of money, it suppose to charge your phone fast but it literally take 25 min for it o go up 1%. I’ve tested it and was wanting to make a video to send to seller. Don’t get this, invest in a better charger.	negative
Scent does not last!! You spray and the smell is gone :(	negative
I like the construction, feels like it will hold up well. Tires are nice. However 5 feet into reeling up my hose for the first time the crank stripped out the threads where it attaches to the spool. I'll fix it by drilling through where it screwed on and threading a bolt through easily enough but it's something to be aware of.	negative
This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money.	negative
Not cut to screen size of OnePlus 6. A bit smaller on the width and height. Will have to return.	negative
I bought these for my business to organize client keys. I don’t trust these will hold up. The plastic is so thin where the metal ring attaches. It could break off and loose the key. It's a good price and I like the organization. You get what you pay for. Update: As I suspected, a key broke off! I kept it tucked in my pocket in case that would happen. The key was safe. That could have been bad!	negative
Did not receive product	negative
Still no pickup of the item for return	negative
Very disappointed. Worked at first. Now, after three months does not work. Cannot recommend.	negative
It does not work iPhone 8 Plus I would like to have a return label you sent it back	negative
These are a slippery nightmare. Just abt broke every bone falling with this things. JUNK!	negative
The rails on this product easily detaches. It looks cheap and the spacing between the top and bottom racks are too tight making shoes clash.	negative
I wanted to like this so bad. There were more good reviews than bad so I gave it a shot. If you have thick course hair or are mixed I don’t recommend this. I kept applying it maybe 3 times and there is still hair there. I tried it on my lip since that’s not as thick and it still left hair on my lip. So bottom line: if you have thinner hair then I recommend this but if you’re of mixed race like me with thick hair then don’t waste your money.	negative
Terrible movie. Did the author direct this? What’s with the chapter announcement every five minutes? Also, the monsters look like an even more warped version of a ninja turtle so there’s that.	negative
Uncomfortable, seemed ineffective with vague instructions. Waste of money.	negative
Despite spending almost an hour with a very patient Amazon tech support person, I could not install this wi-fi extender. Possible issue is my ATT U-verse internet router that may be incompatible with this product, at least by following the included instruction sheet.. The Amazon tech attempted to contact the seller to resolve problem but had only an email address and no phone number to call. I am very impressed with Amazon tech support and would give it 5-stars for effort.	negative
Worst trash bags I've ever used. They have the strength and durability of a food handling plastic glove. The bags dont tear properly at the perforations, making it a huge hassle to separate a new bag from the roll. If you're not careful, it'll tear sideways away from the perforation and make the next bag have a huge hole in it. I tried lifting a half-full bag out of the my trash can today, and the bag ripped apart under the drawstring. Very light load. Utterly useless and horrible product.	negative
The reset buttons do not work. When I added additional coins the next day the indicator on the top did not add to the amount on the lid. I would not purchase this product again.	negative
VERY disappointed after getting notice and notice that the item was on it's way, it never arrived to my father which was very upsetting because this was the first Valentines Day in over 30 Years he was without my step mother! I SENT more than one reply and even a request for the item to be credited back to me and YET nothing!! DON'T waste your time or MONEY!	negative
Used it for three days and on the third day the pole snapped at the base and broke off!	negative
I do not like the trio of shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner because I do not care for the fragrance of them, I left the leave-in conditioner in and styling gel and it turned white so I'm returning asap. I don't know if I will order any more of their product	negative
No information on how to operate	negative
Bummed. I placed the order because the listing shows the book that matches my son's collection. The one I got is a newer publication and has the wrong cover. I already have the one I received and order this item to replace it so I would have the right now and now I have 2 of the wrong ones. Yay!	negative
This series itself is all around terrible. This particular installment feels more like a corny action film than anything. Tons of over the top shoot outs and crack dealers and things. Any charm the purge movies previously had is certainly gone for this one.	negative
The middle two USB do not work and half my equipment will not go through with the hub but work perfectly into the computer. this was a waste of money	negative
Not quality manufacturing. Cheap. Quickly done. Won’t suit because they lack the appropriate receptacle for an EPA approved engine.	negative
As others have stated, What you get is not what you see here in the listing. Instead of a nice little glass vial with a screw on lid you get a cheap plastic piece of crap with a cork stopper. I can see all kinds of problems with this coming open inside the aluminum keychain fob. I bought four hoping to add these to my gifting box but I wouldn't give these to anybody without replacing the plastic vial with something that seals securely. Nice try but epic fail.	negative
I have returned the item to the mail lady she picked it up from me but have not seen anything yet on the refund.	negative
I ordered this for my sister’s birthday and when I opened the box it fell apart in my lap. I wish I had of read the reviews because this seems to be the normal. I am getting a refund. Cheap stuff that wasn’t even put together. Don’t waste your money!!!	negative
IT showed that it was delivered but I never got the items.	negative
Do not buy. Arrived open and popcorn was all over box! I want a refund or a replacement! Was also left in rain with no plastic on it so it was a real soggy mess on my porch!	negative
$35 for a two week supply. Way to expensive. Sending it back.	negative
I'm disappointed that just a few hours right after I bought this, Amazon lowered the price 7 dollars. I can't find where I can request a refund for the difference.	negative
Item was NOT what i ordered. I wanted the bag you could put on your suitcase and they did not give me the correct one.	negative
Didn’t realize it’s has specks in it. Thought i was buying white. They could do a better job making thAt more apparent. Otherwise nice paper if you wants specs.	negative
One of the bulbs arrived broken	negative
Tried it more than 3 times....didn’t work at all	negative
Screen protector is garbage. The privacy screen is false. It degrades the quality of the screen. With it installed, there are dead zones of the screen	negative
Way to small for a 10 year old	negative
"For the first month I put up with ""poor internet connectivity"" as an excuse. I moved it right next to my router and it has always said it's well connected. Everything else works. Totally loved the intermittent interaction with my pet during the day but it doesn't work at all now. I have reset per the instructions about 30 times now and it really does not work. Sad thing: I convinced several coworkers to purchase this. Petcube support is not helpful."	negative
It doesn't straighten your big toe at all.	negative
My PT Therapist recommened this wobble cushion to sit on. However, I tried it for a couple of hours and got a but ache!	negative
I bearly received the headphones 2 days ago and one earbud completely cuts on n off 😔	negative
It didn't work and my lawn is full of weeds!	negative
It’s just cheap penny junk poor quality don’t waste your time and I had to wait nearly 2-1/2 weeks for this same thing you can buy at the swap meet for $2. Very disappointing. Not recommended	negative
I bought because cheap, woops. It broke within 2 minutes. The rubber belt is stretchy like an inner tube so it is near impossible to get a grip, and when i did it just snapped.	negative
I am very unhappy with these socks. They are so small and tight -- and it was very, very difficult to put them on. They felt too tight once they were on -- and they did not stretch out. When I washed them in cold water, they shrank even more. I can't wear these and I would like a refund...please. David Peck	negative
Shows different weight every time i check	negative
The seat was shorter than the one I wanted to replace causing me to be closer to the handle bar	negative
Did not like the quality. Had a spongy back so that makes it hard to remove.	negative
I bought this for one specific tag on my inner thigh. After using it multiple times over the course of a couple months. it has yet to do anything. The tag turns white, becomes uncomfortable to clothing , and then just remains the way it was. So a waste of 50 bucks.	negative
A word of caution on color. This is not blue as shown, but rather a greenish hue with hints of blue. Otherwise it is a nice silk flower. I wanted something more blue vs. more green.	negative
Picture makes it look like you get two but they only deliver one	negative
Terrible quality. Too thin. I think a tissue would work better!	negative
Package was torn at top and bottom with the tender quick all inside the box. Very disappointed. Was not packaged well at all. Tossed around with other items in a large box.	negative
Its already out poor quality	negative
Very cute, but it came broken, very disappointing	negative
Not as protective as other speck cases	negative
Is not good quality. Only used 3/4 times broke within a week or less. But in my opinion I wouldn’t say the problem is not the vendor I honestly just think the note 5 pen is not durable... period. This was my third pen for my phone but my first order from this vendor	negative
I cannot review a product when I have not received it yet. It was supposed to be a hostess gift for Christmas Eve gift to my niece. Very disappointed in the delivery of this item..	negative
biggest piece of crap i ever got on amazon.	negative
Went by reviews but I can't even describe the taste, there's none! It's colored water, don't waste your money!!	negative
Poor fit. Poor quality.	negative
I ordered 2 of them. One was broken at the bottom when I opened it. I contacted the seller had they had me send them pictures of it being broken and the order information. Once they receive that and three to four days later they reply was to contact Amazon. Would not recommend buying these from the seller	negative
Do not buy. It didn’t charge my shark hand vac.	negative
My printer would not recognize the cartridges. Could not use at all. The seal brokers on one of the cartridges when I removed it from the printer.	negative
The color wasn’t even close to the picture/description, as well as the size. The sleeves were too long, while the bottom of the fleece reached almost to my belly button. (I’m 5’5”, 125lbs and ordered a size small.) I’m in the process of returning it after paying $10 to ship it back 🙄 in hopes that I will get a refund. It took almost an entire month to arrive, too. Don’t waste your time.	negative
The hem pulled off after one wear, and the slip is now unwearable. Pretty crap product.	negative
This is NOT white coffee. It brews very dark and tastes just like traditional coffee. Do not get scammed by this product.	negative
The adapter overheated. Asked for an exchange.	negative
I have had this item for well less than one year & the item has a vertical Purple stripe out of the Blue. The unit looks great on the desk but can't really get past this horrible stripe.	negative
This is a review on the replacement sound machine because the original one I bought made a funny chirping/ squeaking noise when the projector function was on. I received my replacement in October. It is now February and only 4 months after using it and the projection has stopped working and of course my window to return it has closed. Crappy product and wouldn’t buy again!	negative
Missed guaranteed delivery date - I ordered this to coincide with another product and expected an on time delivery and it was missed...now the delivery date is uncertain. Amazon needs to stop using USPS since those deliveries are always late and unpredictable.	negative
this candy is very hard hard hard never again	negative
Smoking and burning within 2 minutes of turning it on! Smoke coming from between the food insert and the heating element. Not okay! Amazon sent me a replacement and the replacement did the same thing! Will not be purchasing another.	negative
Boxes were shrink wrapped but looked like they’d been stepped on. Tried to get a refund for prime purchase and for some reason it’s ineligible. It was like a chalk powder lining the shrink wrap bc all of the cigarettes are broken inside AND there are not very many inside	negative
They were to big, not the right size for the car that was specified on the site. Would not purchase again!	negative
Only had 4 in a pack not 6 and they were impossible to pull apart. Also didn't work well on my narrow, close together knobs of my entertainment center.	negative
All of them failed to charge IPhone & iPad after 2 / 3 months of normal use	negative
Very hard to assemble and not what the photo represented.	negative
They are hard to buckle in and need to have a deeper seat so,the pet sits down inside more .	negative
Has a strange off flavor not true cinnamon. I wouldn't buy again	negative
As others have commented, the product is not right. I have used and ordered this and other Red Flower products in the past, but this new formula is terrible. Smells great but very watery and to not lather very well. Unfortunately, I ordered a while ago and just realized that is was bad after the return period.	negative
Would have liked to review, however my package was empty. Please refund my account or send another.	negative
Product sucks. The stuff you're supposed to peal off won't come off. I wasted 2 trying to pray it off.	negative
Horrible quality . So give to this over stuff cheap quality pillow and over priced. The idea of “ one size fits all” is clearly their mentality	negative
I took note of the reviews that said the clock just stopped working, but decided to try it anyway because of its looks. And make no mistake, it is very good looking. Unfortunately it does not work. I even tried replacing the first fresh battery with another fresh battery. It ran for 2 hours and stopped again. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Howard Miller changed their supplier for their clock movements. The low-cost provider can become very expensive if you have to handle a lot of returns and your brand is damaged.	negative
Battery worked fine for about 3 months, after which it would not hold a charge. The only reason it gets one star is that it does indeed fit the tablet.	negative
I was obsessed with this lighter for a week, until it stopped working... piece of junk, STAY AWAY!	negative
This pillow is way too small. My baby was unable to reach my breasts to latch. The pillow is all squished. Also it’s mentioned in the product description that it comes with a small head positioning pillow but I never received any. Would not recommend this as a feeding pillow	negative
EXTREMELY disappointed . Ordered and paid for pink and received the wrong color . The package clearly says pink .	negative
I have had a problem with stink bugs this winter in my house. I bought 2 boxes of these traps. I have killed tons of them and not one has gone near these stupid traps. Don't waste your money. Huge waste of money at almost $15 a box.	negative
This product was shipped on time. Unfortunately is was not the product featured in the listing. The listing claims it’s anti-perspirant. But what arrived at my door was deodorant. I have issued a disputed but the vendor has not responded.	negative
Grounds fell through even when I set the grinder to course. So I had to use a normal paper filter anyway. I like to grind my coffee to medium coarseness, so this does not work at all.	negative
Impossible to get cats in and then have them stay there.	negative
I have bought the ped egg before, and I think this is a counterfeit. It is cheap and poorly moulded. It also arrived quite dirty with unknown filth, and arrived more than a month after I ordered it. I doubt it is safe. I washed my hands after throwing it in the trash.	negative
The item did not work well for us. It needed to be stronger.	negative
Don't trust this seller, I haven't received my order and I order it months ago	negative
Hi Seller, I have not received my stuff. Thanks	negative
This item got all torn up after only 6 months. Wrote to the company to see if they would do something to possibly return or refund and never heard any response.Waited to even write this review giving them an opportunity. Even for 50.00 I feel like the purse should of held up better than this. Stitching comes out very easy and IS NOT something I would trust with my gun. BE AWARE	negative
Worse thing ever! Do not buy!	negative
Stupid ! The ball goes everywhere then you want it to go.	negative
received it broken. would like a refund	negative
Three times I ordered 16 inch brackets and today for the third time I received 20 inch brackets. Packaging is labeled as 16 inch brackets but measure out at 20 inches.	negative
I never received this item. Other items delivered on Oct 19th were placed on door step, in excellent condition. I was hoping the product was just lagging behind. I was hoping to receive the pads before my training exercise scheduled for Nov 3rd. I need to resolve this issue. If I need to reorder the item, I need to know is ASAP. Thank you. Ray Solis.	negative
I will never order from Amazon again. I never received my package. Thia is not the only first time they lie! Their drivers need to be more honest	negative
Terrible. Watered down lotion and DOES NOT ENHANCE TAN! Do not buy!!!	negative
Did not properly fit phone	negative
I never got my item it never showed up	negative
The umbrella is quite large. 3+ people can easily fit under it. It worked well for shade but rain is another story. It leaks from the top, in ththe center, where the handle meets the fabric of the umbrella. I reached out to the seller but was directed the contact Amazon. Because I am outside of the 30 day window, I am stuck with an umbrella that can only be used for shade. So this was a waste.	negative
Not a good product. Tried grinding with it and the grinder would just keep shutting down on me.	negative
Bracket that holds handing files broke in less than 60 days of lights use!	negative
Does not work as described. These reviews are false. DO NOT PURCHASE, not even eligible for return. Do not make same mistake I did.	negative
Don't waste your money on this belt, it lasted less than 2 months and already broke, i have to reinstall the old belt for now till I get a new 1, absolutely terrible craftsmanship on this belt.	negative
Avoid for shrimp tanks. Killed many cherries.	negative
Eye shadow came in busted. Huge dusty mess everywhere.	negative
Parts were broken before I received them.	negative
The product is smaller than the dimensions listed on Amazon. The description lists the griddle a 16” long by 14” wide. The griddle is actually 12 1/4” wide. Would have ordered the larger one if we had known the dimensions were not exactly what was listed. Considering a return.	negative
Didn't work. Instructions are not clear.	negative
You cannot use a different microphone than the one that came with your camera. This is a major limitation, which means you can't make a video with high quality sound. It claimed to be a webcam, but after an hour of modification, I gave up. You have to download a third-party app to complete, for the price, this is medium, the iPhone can definitely shoot better videos, I don't recommend buying	negative
This is crap. Don’t buy it. No instructions.	negative
Never received product	negative
Display didn't work out of the box. Returned for a refund.	negative
Not fun, doesn’t do what it says. Doesn’t follow at all. Pretty lame.	negative
When I opened my package, it had black marks all over it.	negative
I guess you really do get what you pay for.	negative
they are garbage. They do not keep there seal at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY	negative
I bought this watch as new, but it seems like it has already been used by someone so badly! The screen is scratched, straps are awfully dirty. I am returning this piece of crap ASAP!	negative
2 came in the pack, 1 didnt stick right right out of the gate. 2nd one stuck for 2 days. Followed instructions for the install, just a horrible product.. Most of the reviews are not for the screen protector, dont know how they managed that....	negative
Did not look like the photo. It was open on the back.	negative
Doesn't even keep drinks warm!	negative
I purchased 3 sets of these lights and they have been nothing but problems. I have tried to contact this seller multiple times but no response. These lights will not stay connected and will just start flashing like strobe lights. Not ideal at all. Seller, Please contact me as soon as possible. I would like to be refunded.	negative
Crap, broke after 3 months don't buy this!	negative
1 knife manufacturing defects	negative
Don't waste your money unless you have cheap headphones to begin with.	negative
I bought this rate to hopefully get the hair off of my artificial grass. It’s too soft and it does not get the grass out. I wish someone made a tool for this need.	negative
So small, and the whole thing got very hot to the touch. Not recommended at all.	negative
Item stated it would come in original packaging- it did not. Item has hard/jagged pieces of someone's old screen protector stuck to it.	negative
The sound was way off. It was almost 2 seconds off of the mouth or action.	negative
As a cosplayer I own a numerous amount of wigs. I've never had a wig have this much fallout. I couldnt even style it without pulling out chunks of hair. Save yourself some heartache, time and money. Buy the more expensive wig.	negative
This dress is completely sheer.	negative
The diamonds started falling off the first day and kept pricking my fingers .. I took the case off after 2 days and never used it again a waste of money	negative
I just tried to use these printer cartridges and they not even fit my printer - so don't buy this product. I am throwing away $$$$$$$	negative
Broke after 2 weeks. Lights won’t work & sound is malfunctioning. Missed the return window by 3 days.	negative
The right earbud keeps cutting in and out. Yes I have disconnected and re-paired. Don’t know why it’s doing that. I will return them.	negative
Seal was broke, it was rancid. I ended up ordering the capsules from another seller and they work well.	negative
This suede dye turned the shoes from navy blue to an inconsistent shiny brown.	negative
Really cool backpack. Good full size and the sequins are great but after two months of my 8 year old using it five days a week the loop at the top ripped off and one of the straps is starting to tear off as well. She’s 8, so there’s not a lot that goes into her bag as far as weight.	negative
It says it comes with a charger and it does not. I ordered one the first time and it didn’t come with charger, I emailed this company and they sent another one no charger the band was already on it. I am not happy.	negative
I disliked it due to the fact of how small and very pigmented the picture looked	negative
I received this product today when I opened the box it was missing the creme developer.	negative
Stopped working after 2 months	negative
This product is dangerous for children. Do not buy	negative
Broke within a couple months	negative
Disliked how Lacey pushed her parents into talking about their marital issues. That's between them and if they want to share with her, she should allow them to do it on their terms. But anything for our kids even let them document such a private story for personal gain.	negative
5 shorts came in a package deal! 4 shorts all had thread issues and started unthreading immediately!! It got so frustrating I threw most away (1 is still in good condition, the other 4 kept unthreading)	negative

I ordered this case and it was broken when I got it out of the plastic. It’s cheap I wouldn’t recommend someone getting it. Waste of money smh	negative
We opened it played with it and it turned wet and melted in your hand and left blue color all over!!!! It was horrible threw it right away!!! Do not buy this	negative
Buyer beware! I ordered this earring because I truly thought it was so pretty and they could be worn with just about anything. Imagine how disappointed I was when they sent me a pair earrings that I didn’t order. Not going to pay to send them back, not to mention the hassle.	negative
Very disappointed! The information was very misleading by giving the customer the assumption they were buying more than one product for the outrageous high price and the metallic instrument was very cheap for that price. When I spoke to an Amazon personnel they also believed the product came as an assortment of 12. When I received the 1 product, it was damaged by being cracked and discolored. I have now returned it waiting for my refund.	negative
Sticky but not dried out so easily peeled off. Not recommend.	negative
Not a good value as the selling price is 2x the price that you can buy these at Target or Walmart. Would definitely not buy here again,	negative
I regret my decision to purchase this product. There were blue and red lines all over the screen and I couldn't see my screen clearly.	negative
Range is closer to 30 miles or less not 150 miles. I don’t live in a valley or have large obstructions around. Disappointed in signal strength.	negative
THIS IS A HORRIBLE CAR COVER. IT'S LIGHT, MADE SO POORLY, TORE AFTER ONE WEEK. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE ON TOP AND IF YOU DON'T SEARCH....YOU WILL BE TRICKED!!	negative

The bottom of the jar is cracked and leaked in the plastic.	negative
No matter what we tried we could not get our newer laptops connect to an old projector with this. Multiple computers would not communicate with it.	negative
Already broken after two days. I know these are not actual climbing caribiners but they should last more than two days. Using as a keychain and the spring just quit. Extremely low quality	negative
Poor quality. One filter broke internally after 3 weeks use.	negative
The one star is because it looks great. Otherwise I went through three motor assemblies and all of them failed, the first didn’t even work out of the box. The deadbolt motor assembly is so cheap it cannot last on daily use for more than a week.	negative
This item is a true failure. My mistake for not looking further into it before purchase. And regret not making the time to return it. Just picked it from under some papers and shook my head!	negative
Part arrived broken. Have not received email response from company regarding replacement (4 days ago). Very disappointed.	negative
Failed on the first use. I would not trust this with anything critical. Power pin broke off.	negative
Don't bother. It won't stay attached to the garage. Used the adhesive they provided, and it fell. Used carpet tape and several other tapes- stayed up longer. The lower panels remained attached mostly, but the top ones slowly separated from the garage door, looking ever so classy.	negative
It was more like a kids M. Way too small.	negative
These are the worst fitting xxl compression socks ever. I would have trouble thinking that these would fit someone that used large ones.	negative
3 bags were open and completely empty in the shipping box with hot cocoa powder on everything. It spilled all over my floor when I opened the box. Unacceptable. Not eligible for a return either!	negative
Pillow had a hole within 2 weeks of use. Returned for refund. Big mess, beads everywhere in bed!	negative
Gave a 1 because zero wasn’t an option. Received cracked. It’s cheap. Don’t buy from them because you can’t return broken items. Rip off	negative
Great size and like the glass bottle. However, it constantly leaks no matter what is done. It seems to even leak when it is just sitting upright. Do NOT waste your money on this.	negative
Very dissatisfied! Product ordered was for 3 months and received supply for ALMOST 1 months worth. Bottle also says 3 months supply. They are deceiving and not to be trusted. ONLY SELECTED ONE STAR BECAUSE THERE IS JO OPTION FOR ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!	negative
Broke after a few months sitting there. One day I plugged it in, and nothing lights up anymore.	negative
Constant buzzing. This thing is dangerous. It about blew my ear drums out. DO NOT BUY.	negative
very cheap had to find brackets in local hardware store to attach to bike	negative
The lid doesn't seal against the cups, so parts fall out of the cups when you pick it up.	negative
Broken in under 2 months - save your money - lid is plastic not stainless steel.	negative
These are tiny, the middle section can hold a few raisins, blueberries or m&ms. I'm talking like 5. So for a small snack for a toddler, this would probably work. But for bigger kids it doesn't serve much purpose, even for snacks. If it were half the cost, I probably wouldn't complain, but for what they charge for these things, I recommend spending your money on something more useful.	negative
ordered on 25 Feb no delivery on 27 Feb as promised. Replacement required.	negative
These do NOT work. All you hear is static. No music comes through at all!!	negative
Did not receive all bits. 3/4 was missing	negative
Cheap plastic. Damaged from the box. Hinge barely holds the weight of the product itself. Did not hold my Galaxy S8 in landscape orientation. Only 2 rubber feet - not enough to keep the charger in place. Returning.	negative
I have chronic knee pains due to arthritis. I gave this product I try but am not happy with it. It even made my knees fire up in pain. Im going back to the other brand its a bit pricey but really works	negative
It does not have glass. It's Plastic !. It breaks easily! poor quality	negative
Love this game, but had to delete because of glitches. Hope it's the computer, I really love this game. It's just the atari version	negative
Can't give you a review as I have not received this item.	negative
Boring, great character development if you like a main character who makes foolish choices and is over dramatic and self centered. Self absorbed	negative
If you are looking for something to listen to the radio on beware that radio doesn't have an external antenna on it. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had realized that.	negative
Pieces were coming off it	negative
Bought this to clean up cat hair . It does not do it. The spinning brush has stopped spinning if there is any tiny pressure put on it. I'm not talking about heavy pressure, the least amount of pressure, just putting it on the floor stops the brush. Its useless.	negative
Taste horrible. Couldn't tell if it was doing any good. Waste of money.	negative
When I first received the radio I was delighted by its small size and the clarity of the sound. But, less than two weeks after I received it, after I recharged it, the radio didn't turn on. I tried it the next day and the same thing happened. I returned it.	negative
I ordered this book for my boyfriend in the army. It came all bent up and ruined. I don’t even want to send it to him .....	negative
These pants suck. Extremely cheaply made. One layer of fabric and it's not even very soft, the pockets feel terrible on top of everything. The drawstring fell out after about 2 washes and the pants shrunk as well.	negative
The shelf is great and suction cups seem fine and able to hold weight, however, it doesn’t sit level.	negative
They do not work as well as described. They don't stick as they should to the phone. They somewhat hover over your screen so it slows your ability to type as your finger cannot touch the screen like it should.	negative
Super disappointed with this product. I always get the notification saying my phone can’t connect with the accessory. Wish I never bought this.	negative
Handle is crooked and overall super poor quality.	negative
Beware buyers! I ordered Gold and received Orange! No return policy nor any contact info so I am stuck with the wrong color! This is unacceptable! I have a huge show this weekend so now I have to go shopping for gold ones.	negative
Worked OK for about a month. Now completely dead. Worse than the one it replaced	negative
Good for a short period of time. Now they want to change modes or cycle through modes when the lens is pulled out to make a spot beam. When barely touching the switch it will also change modes. Wish they worked the way they are supposed to, because I really like the size and convenience, fits in watch pocket on jeans, very handy.	negative
I bought this for the Galaxy S9 plus and I should have read it the reviews first. As they said I the reviews it doesn't stick to the phone screen and when you put a case on it your touch screen is useless. Do not buy this product for the Galaxy S9 plus	negative
This is not keeping time, we have replaced the battery twice, checks the hands and cannot understand why it won't work!!!	negative
Came opened and dripping	negative
Worked for 5 days and then nothing. It would act like it was working and online, until I got to location to just find it dead. I am in Texas, where it hit 100 today, but this thing was in the shade and protected from rain. Didn't even get to try it with rain.	negative
I had to move my mount for my VAVA magnetic phone holder. The old adhesive had to be replaced. I’ve gone through 2 of these in 24 hours and it won’t hold the mount in place. I’ve cleaned the area with alcohol and it won’t stay in place kept coming off. Also it pulled off very easy from the actual mount it self. The adhesive wasn’t very strong, and this product is actually bigger than the area where the adhesive goes.	negative
Remote never worked. Can’t find a way to get a new one. Lights will not work	negative
Pros : colors and brightness Cons : use one time in fountain 2/4 lights water got into light	negative
Mattress Still slipped off the futon...worthless, really wanted these to work too but DIDNT KEEP MATTRESS IN PLACE :(	negative
A 1” hole unravelled on the back of the right glove on the second day I wore them.	negative
The plant arrived frozen and as a result it is half dead. I did not carefully read the return policy and an unable to return the fern which is unfortunate.	negative
When I purchased this charger the description said it was USB Type C. It is not and the description has since been changed. I will purchase elsewhere.	negative
This does not work. I have a c cable that I wanted to use this with. You can’t even get the plug in.it’s made too small	negative
Save your money keep looking	negative
mediocre quality but I will be keeping. just remember you get what you paid for. updated--Ended up returning because it broke within 2 weeks of purchase	negative
Ordered the double hooks and received the single hooks.	negative
Bikini itself is great. However, was sent a small top and a medium bottom.	negative
Why are you including wipes that DAMAGE expensive mac screens? My camera is now completely cloudy and I'll have to get an external one.	negative
I have just recently bought this, I got shocked all these good reviews. It couldn' t provide enough power all the time. I don' t recommend.	negative
Half the keys didn't work and we're lodged so they didn't even depress.	negative
The product itself is okay and my son loves it but this listing is erroneous. It said I purchased 48 pouches but only 1 box of 4 arrived!!!	negative
The color was off and the dress sizes ran really small.	negative
It not like the picture very disappointed ☹️	negative
My cat used to love this stuff and would wait for me to put on her food before she would eat it. Now she backs away from it. I can tell the texture and color has changed too.	negative
game really let me down, game was extremely sub par, did not follow first game at all. i was a fan of the first one but i hate that i wasted my money on the second one.	negative
I was so excited the first time I purchased and it scented my home so well that I bought two more. ALL 4 stopped working. They shut off after a couple minutes and don’t hold a scent. Very disappointed.	negative
This is my third and final order of this coffee and the first bag was great but the second bag was delivered with the bag not sealed and so was the third. So needless to say the beans were dried out. I'm not happy. Before I opened the box which contained a few other items I could smell coffee. I knew immediately this was not going to be good. I will never purchase again.	negative
So cheap, broke in two week	negative
I have not received it. I ordered quite sometime ago. Hopefully I will get it.	negative
Product Box was clearly opened before. Left side of box was dented and front covering has dents as well.	negative
Order was not received. I find no place, other then this and it was not on my porch.	negative
Ouch--major splinters when you hold these. They need to be finished. Sent them back.	negative
I owned one of these before, intimately familiar with it. This unit has defect in the roller wheel that snags up and stops. The top doesn't snap open like my previous not either. That's where knockoffs can be seen - in the tiniest important details.	negative
Bought this product in Dec 2017 used it on a 3 day trip in December worked fine, a week ago was getting ready to leave for the summer and it quit going up so I had to hand crank. Junk so buyer beware barely lasted 3 months.	negative
Don't buy this. Very low quality crank. The leverage mechanism is based on a single pot metal pin and broke on first use. Too late to return item.	negative
I emailed this seller trying to resolve this and so far have not heard back. I needed this for a theatre production, but settled for Walmart brand after this result. Not worth the hassle!!!	negative
Said 2 pack only got 1	negative
Never received product	negative
Bulbs were bright and nice color but half of them have gone bad in a year.	negative
This is piece of shit!!! Do not waste your money for this!!!	negative
Piece of crap. Plugs have to be wiggled into place. Last one dies after 4 months. We don't make anything anymore. I guess I should try to find an extension cord at n antique store or make one myself.	negative
It was working fine for a while but recently it decided to stop charging after a few minutes of being activated. I need it to charge my phone until it's dead, not to stop charging seconds after I activate it. The first one I bought worked fine, but this one is very unreliable.	negative
Super thin, paper plates are thicker. Tried to send them back and the postage was going to be $100.00. Company responded, saying that they are a visual screening product only. Don't recall that line in the product description... Found a far higher quality product at our local farm and feed store for about 10 - 15% more.	negative
This barely fit an iPhone 8+ so I had to return item. The fit was so tight that removing the phone daily was impractical.	negative
My daughter was very disappointed, one of the necklaces arrived with a broken chain. Too much hassle to return. Lesson learned.	negative
Not actually stainless steel. Jewelry turned green after a few days of wearing, and caused an allergic reaction.	negative
"I've always loved KONG products. However, my dogs had this one torn apart within 30 minutes of receiving it to play with. One of the ""legs"" came off first, and now for the past 4 days, I've been finding bits of the middle rope all over the house."	negative
This pool heater has not worked upon installation , when contacted the company they put me in touch with someone who repairs who has not shown up or called back	negative
This product is advertised as fitting a 2003 Buick LeSabre. It looks completely different from the OEM wiper motor currently installed in the car, and the fittings are not in the same places. By the time I had the opportunity to work on the car, the return window had passed. Not happy.	negative
This is a fragrant oil, NOT ESSENTIAL OIL. Wish I read all the label carefully. Don't buy if you're looking for essential oil.	negative
Complete trash. scam. I returned for refund	negative
Bought this version because the lid looked like an improvement on previous models. It’s not. The water leaks everywhere and the only place it can be used is in a bathtub or outside. I paid more money to get the new lid and I should ha e just gone with the original model. Really disappointed with the product.	negative
This is the band I received.	negative
WEAK . it broke . the worst	negative
What a surprise, picture shows complete unit on a hanger but guess what no hanger! Just a fabric material with 10 clips attached very disappointing then show it that way in the picture	negative
They were sick I believed. I'm assuming from the travel. Anyway infected my whole entire aquarium. All my hermits I collected Died.	negative
The shorter cables worked fine bu the long one will not charge the devices. Even the shorter ones have a hard time charging the device if the screen is on at the same time.	negative
I hated it. It didn’t mix well with anything.	negative
These headphone are the worst!!! They are Bluetooth sure but they’re endless static!!!!! From the moment I plugged them in no matter what I’m listening to, just loud static over what I’m trying to hear. DO NOT BUY!	negative
Was never close to 4500 mAh. Probably more like 1200 mAh. Gave one 80% charge at most. It worked for about ten days then wouldn't take a charge. Actually drained my iPhone battery twice while I thought it was charging overnight. When it did work I had to charge the phone and battery pack separately. MADE IN CHINA. I should have known better. Headphone jack very slim. None of my headphones could plug in. Waste of time. Waste of money.	negative
Pretty sure the driver dropped it over my fence and broke it so I never got to use it.	negative
The original package was opened and taped shut. When I went to return the item it said “this item can’t be returned.”	negative
I've been an anime fan for decades. This style of CGI and anime combination make what should be shows with great potential into garbage.	negative
Cheaply made. Fell apart easily. Feathers began to come off a few months after purchase. Doesnt look that good in person	negative
i had them for less than a month and one by one they all just stopped working and my phone would say “accessory is not supported”	negative
Completely overrated. Did not meet basic expectation. A large area of cover cracked and shattered in my hand while I was sitting in my doctors' office using it. moisture and debris quickly became trapped under the cover. I replaced it a week later with an $8.00 protector that works great! Customer service was great.	negative
Shipping was horrendous package didn’t arrive Friday as scheduled and paid for, I’m going to look like a complete jackass, I’m filing a complaint with everybody I can file a complaint with for the rest of my life I’m so mad	negative
Everything was sent well-packaged, but the product had no sweetness. I have bought the same brand in organic and only needed one spoon in my coffee. With this one I need 6!	negative
These little led lights are very difficult to string together and most of them dont work. The lights are so inconsistent meaning some will come on some will not and at other times all of them might come on but not the right color. It's sort of chaotic have to check and recheck connections. I would not recommend these for any type of advanced led job.	negative
My phone will not fast charge with these cables Razor Phone 2. junk 3 weeks and all 3 no longer charge	negative
The handle is very short so it doesn't work well for taller people without always having to bend over	negative
Buyer beware!! Tampered packaging & then no return allowed. When these products arrived to me, they were in already opened packaging that had been taped closed again. And then the seller would not allow a return.	negative
Did not received. Do i need to reorder?	negative
this was not the twine that I received. I go some janky white yarn instead of twine.	negative
Don’t know why but the costume was very, very wrinkled (plastic). Wondering if it was returned and not properly repackaged. The fan was not powerful enough as to keep the head all up and stretch the wrinkles. It did not look good when I tested it... even less for the price. Sending it back. Runs large. I am 5’7” and I think it would be too hard for me to wear it ... maybe it works well for a taller person or a big guy. Also, the tutu is nothing like the picture.	negative
they broke the same night we got them don't bother	negative
Not what I expected at all	negative
They aren’t what I need I won’t send them back it wouldn’t be fair . Sincerely Kristine Brown	negative
Stinks like chemicals. I don't find that it is real leather.	negative
They didn't even do thier job right and the screw not all the way in and now I'm fighting with them to get one different cuz its only one but I need to send both back but can't my old ones where broke	negative
Flower is not attached to the clip	negative
I was expecting the chain to be a little thicker.	negative
One didn’t last 1 month and the other less and 6 months. Junk!!	negative
This Bluetooth was useless. I could not hear the person on the other line, there was always background noise & the person I talked to always had to ask me to repeat what I said. The ear piece was uncomfortable & kept falling out of my ear. Not a good product at all.	negative
Horrible product!! My hair looked and felt so bad after using it that I had to wash it. Does absolutely nothing that it is supposed to do and I am a frequent dry shampoo user so I know what it is supposed to do. Either this product is counterfeit or just horrible.	negative
Broke after 2 uses, not worth the money.	negative
Extremely inaccurate readings even after soil calibration. Takes 90 seconds between each reading and there is no way to manually poll the probe to make the process quicker. Very basic and ugly user interface that makes the entire experience painful.	negative
product claimed to withstand upto 2000 degree radiant heat but melted on my motorcycle exhaust pipes within seconds.exhaust pipes only get to half that temp. waste of money and gave my a nice clean up job to take care of	negative
Goes in garbage almost right away	negative
Confusion regarding what is free and what costs	negative
They break to easily, my daughter has been through 2 .	negative
The price was very reasonable, and I don’t have to go to the vet’s office to get it. However, the product is past its expiration date. And they put a “new” sticker over the expiration date, I guess thinking I wouldn’t notice. I would send back for a refund, but the return shipping will be taken out of the refund amount. Not worth it. Plus, I feel that they would probably turn around and resell to another unsuspecting customer. I’m dealing with my pet’s health - I want something effective and safe.	negative
Advertised for iPad 2 but DUD NOT FIT!	negative
Although it came out fairly okay - had I not painted them they’d look really cheap. This is the same material as styrofoam plates the same ones that are bad for the environment and are way to pricey for what we as customers are being duped into purchasing. Once I purchased it I had to keep going to finish the cieling. Looks better than popcorn but dissatisfied with what the materials are and how they look. For the price it should have came primed or already painted.	negative
The face was messed up on and the 1st one the the lights didn’t even work. My boys love Scooby-Doo and they saw when I was looking at decorations online and wanted, what a huge disappointment this item is.	negative
don't waste your money in this.it doesn't have any support also elastic keep rolling	negative
Did receive it...received something of different color and design	negative
Wasn't aware of its other ingredients included soybean oil, which likely to be GMO	negative
Even if you squeeze all the water out of the spout, it ends up with brown water coming out the next use. It's really gross.	negative
Very disappointed with Under Armour. Thought I was ordering a Golf Visor but was sent a CAP, not a visor. May have been a great cap and worth the money. Maybe Headline Golf Visor means Cap,still very disappointed with Under Armour, I was looking for a visor. Needed the visor for Christmas! The photo of the visor is not what I received. Called Under Armour and told them about wrong item sent, pretty much told too bad. Live and learn.	negative
At first they all worked, but the 10 foot cord stopped working after 1 day. Still pretty cheap price but if more break, I'll be pretty disappointed.	negative
I have had 2 of these and the clip keeps breaking! The case is bulky and hard to hold onto to.	negative
Very disappointed, I thought the panels were plastic, but it's soft material, and no good for kids bedroom they will destroy this in a day. Also the doors don't close properly the magnets sucks, the instructions are crap. Right after I build it it practically loosened up moving to another room. Waste of money. not worth it I don't recommend it.	negative
It took alot to shine it it looked dull at first i did not like it	negative
returned it. poor quality, air filler was very cheap, did not work well at all	negative
So we bought two of these things, one right out of the box never worked. The instructions are horrible don't expect any help from what is said in them. The second one has worked pretty well for the time we've had it. But the tube that the led rests on the end of easily pulls out of the body that houses the batteries. Overall these things are cheaply made and junky. Returned the 1st one... we'll see about the second one.	negative
I tried several if the heads it came with, but none of them seemed to work.	negative
The vacuum and the charging base did not work together. The vacuum only lasted a few minutes. Tried to fix but no luck. Really was a waste of money. Could do better with a simple little broom.	negative
I ordered this 2 pack a couple of months ago for my Black and Decker blower and trimmer. They will not charge. The black and decker charger flashes red indicating a bad battery (both). I unfortunately did not try these until after the return window closed. Out of luck!!!	negative
I am returning this item. Although it was a used item. I did not expect it to be filthy. I also did not expect it to come without the 2 cords that were supposed to be with it. Also did not have any type of instructions with it.	negative
Product is hard to move and the gate panels are impossible to unsnap. Don’t buy.	negative
Please note if you put these covers on you cant close your charging case and the phone will not charge	negative
Worked for a few days then just stopped working	negative
These bars have the same texture was quest bars, however they do not taste good. I tried 6 flavors and will never buy again.	negative
The DVD was delivered damaged. It is brand new, but the center piece was broken, so the DVD slid around and was scratched.	negative
I enjoy the content. The quality of the cover is really bad. I have only had it for two months and it is falling apart and I have ised it with care.	negative
I never received my package.	negative
Does not work sadly bought in October and just tried now. So no return possible. I tried adding the power supply as suggested in one review and still did not work.	negative
I returned these cards. Featured in the card was a website for encouragement. I couldn’t get the website	negative
Chair was shipped damaged. Shipping box was fine. Will be returning and not ordering again from this seller.	negative
I was so excited to receive these since they’ve been discontinued and no longer in stores. I did not expect these to arrive unpackaged. They should have been in the original package that is sealed. I’m hesitant to use them not knowing if they’ve been tampered with.	negative
when this thing came in the mail I was so upset about how flimsy it was and just not what it looked like the picture, it is made out of literal paper, it came with a little white stick and a little dab of glue to glue it on to the letters... and it fell apart. I wanted to return this crap a long time ago I've just been busy but damn I regret not doing so sooner because my money was wasted.	negative
DO NOT BUY! Remote doesn’t turn light on and off.	negative
This does not work at all. I plugged it in and left it. My electric bill is higher this month.	negative
Didnt work at all. What a mess too.	negative
I am very disappointed, the red wallet came with gold rings or buckles and others darkened.	negative
So I would’ve given these more stars , but I think they are actually knock offs. Reason being. I own 3 pair in medium. These are large and barely fit my thighs. They seem completely different. That losses me off.	negative
Box came damaged. Looks like someone opened it prior to sending it to me. Pop is okay.	negative
Cheap! Don't waste your money.	negative
The green monster would not stay inflated! What a bust for my grandkids!!!	negative
Ordered a ring June 27th and still haven't received it or heard anything regarding it	negative
its stinky. not good	negative
Extremely disappointed because I have prime shipping and was supposed supposed to receive this product today by 8pm. “Guaranteed delivery by Tuesday October 15”. Needed this for a friends birthday and now it’s coming late who knows when .	negative
Junk.. absolute junk. It stopped working after two days. Picture quality sucks	negative
unfortunately they advertise compatible with the canon 137 cartridge but it not long story short I had to buy a original one and stop wasting time and money	negative
Took my kitties for a walk in the park. One jumped out, I never saw him again!!!!!! Why would a pet stroller put unnecessary wholes on the side of it? Epic fail! I gave it away.	negative
The sound quality is poor. It kept skipping.	negative
36 dd and 142 pounds I ordered xlarge after reading reviews and checking measurements. It was so baggy ! The quality looked great . Very dissapointed to have to return and wait weeks to reorder when the refund clears Update: received refund and ordered a large still to big the sizing is horribly inaccurate and the zipper is bad quality not going through a second return and waiting to try again	negative
Order was incomplete. One 50 pack was open and it was missing 7 chargers.	negative
Dented Cans continue to be a problem and some have to be thrown away. Some are already exploded when received. Packaging should be better. Too costly to have this happen	negative
I’d like yo keep this coat rack but they sent the wrong screws etc so it can’t be put together. And, there was no customer service number provided so I call and have the right screws etc. sent. So, I’m not sure if I’ll be keeping it.	negative
Logo & lettering stick to plastic bag they come in then pull off of pads when removing from bag. Obtained a replacement set and they did same thing.	negative
It was watered down.	negative
Cheap. The buttons you pressed were not the ones that activated. It would start talking at night when no one was around, constantly! And I bought 2 of these - they both did this stuff!	negative
It was awful didn't work at all I've taking this for a month and a half and I've stopped suing. Nothing worked terrible	negative
I wrote a review on this joint x and I had said it didn’t do a thing for me of course I have took the whole bottle and still nothing! I wish they would put a better product out to help my joints.	negative
I tried it with batteries I had, a new set of batteries, and plugged into the house. NOTHING WORKED!	negative
Trouble from the start. Hex screw used to secure blade is stripped from the very beginning. Try and find a replacement screw from local hardware store. Have yet to turn on and had it a month	negative
This case is not protective it broke my iPad after 2 3ft drops	negative
The blow dryer should be put on the toys section on amazon. This toy was a big joke I had breath hotter than this blow dryer. Do you self a favor and pay extra for a good one.	negative
Used pump on a John Deere with Kohler engine. Pumped worked for 1 month and then failed.	negative
Valve stem split and blew out while I was riding my motorcycle on the highway. They didnt even last 1 riding season. These are a hazard and a risk to life.	negative
So I’ve had this mount for about 3 months and I absolutely hate it. The housing is good but the mount arm is poor quality. It does not stay where I need it to so I’ve had to tape it in place, which you can imagine is barely effective for an outdoor mount. I would not recommend purchasing this. There has to be a better product than this one.	negative
not working for me and after taste is terrible, so make sure to take with meals....	negative
Worst drip coffee maker I ever had, and i used cheaper and less brand name ones. What's going on there during brewing that makes coffee grounds spray all over the machine? I have to wipe showerhead every time after use because its covered with coffee grinds. I NEVER had this happen in any type of coffee machine. And it's not too much coffee or water since water leaks thru and I get half a cup of coffee regardless of how much water I pour in. The WORST!!!	negative
NOT OPI put it in nuetral!! Very disappointed. Cant believe Amazon would sell such horrible fake polish. Cant believe I paid over 10$ for this crap	negative
I am not as happy with this screen protector I purchased 3 days ago and I got them today I am not as happy with this screen protector. After the initial its alot of bubbles and so blurry it so disappointing and I peeling of right away.	negative
After several use, color line show... at the edge of the paper i am returning to original	negative
they sent the wrong size but its cheaply made and not worth it.	negative
it seems as if they just break for no reason. and does not give the protection needed. x4	negative
Wish it was a little larger.	negative
Cheap garbage. The hardware that came with it broke.	negative
This mouse is absolute trash, it works for a few seconds and then stops. Don't waste your money	negative

Doesn’t stay put. Straight up fell down after a month and hit my kid on the head, then put a dent in the shower. Been 30 days, no refund available? Real chill, guys...	negative
"Garbage product, didnt work upon arrival. Tried on 2 different TVs and just got the ""blue screen"" that so many people on here also say they got. This thing is trash, should have listened to all the 1 star reviews. Do not waste your time or money on this product!"	negative
Connections were proper but absolutely no power.	negative
DO NOT BUY!! I had this for about a week or two and it already broke. Cheap quality! The little bearing fell out where you disconnect and now the keys don’t stay together.	negative
I used this perhaps 10 times and it always worked great. And then it just stopped working altogether.	negative
The wrong product is what arrived. The box on the outside is labeled beer glasses but had a “new product” label with these carafes. Was very disappointed since I ordered them for an event soon after they arrived. Returned product and received refund. I wish I got them because they would have been perfect!	negative
The wires burned with heat after first use. Thankfully we avoided fire.	negative
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He will get it in his Easter Basket on Sunday. I cannot rate this item until he uses it and we see how it works.	negative
Not only does the ring not close, there is no way that it is 18G like I ordered. I have always worn 18G in my nose and this would not go in my nose due to how thick it was.	negative
Is hard to write and doesn't read my fingerprint. And also has a wear circle on the screen that supost to read better you fingerprint. I heated this screen.	negative
Worst charger ever. I have had it barely one month and the metal part that goes in your phone broke off inside my phone when I went to un-charge, I had to use pliers to rip it out. Do not buy!	negative
Fake product!!!!!! Smells terrible and dried out my hair. I've used the real thing and this is NOT it.	negative
This is hands down my worst amazon purchase. I am very unhappy wth it. They leak like crazy, when you squeeze the liquid comes out the sides of the bottle. I put an expensive cream in it, the bottle fell in tub for a second and it ruined the cream. Do not buy. Terrible quality	negative
The strips I received all turned gray a few weeks after purchasing them. Too late to return. They don’t expire until 2021 and I kept the bottle closed and in a dark place. Not sure what happens. I guess they were pretty accurate at first. But after they all turned gray I’m left to wonder if they ever really worked.	negative
My son backpack started peaking within the first week.	negative
attach the battery connector. This is so cheap.	negative
Other than being totally dented on one side it seemed ok.	negative
Never received package thankful that seller FINALLY refunded me. Never buying from a 3rd party again	negative
It does not work for me!	negative
Was easy to install but I didn’t like the quality	negative
Sadly I trusted what I bought because of the name Ritz being involved. They made this look like a good sling for an SLR but my Canon T7i with battery grip is to large to go in the bag at all. Even with no padding it won't fit. They would allow a return but the shipping fee is so much I would only get $4 of my money back. So what's the point. Don't buy this bag if you have a real camera.	negative
This item arrived damaged again!	negative
"Tried to pair new Kenwood radio with iPhone, android and couldn't get it to work. Tried to use it with Mac Pro laptop and it would not work. I sent the first one back, no luck with the second. I had to return it also. Seller claims it was the fault of my ""car computer."" No help at all."	negative
Priced twice as high as target for same item	negative
I loved these at first, but two of the 4 are already cracked after less than a month of use, they were not dropped or put in the dishwasher. Disappointed!!	negative
Very cheap causes splinters	negative
Keyboard has stopped working in less than 5 months.	negative
For the second time, this product came to me defective. The contents do not have enough pressure to spray out the nozzle, so the contents just drip out. Can't use on my hair. How can I receive a refund or a replacement?	negative
The pair I bought in the store for my girlfriend seemed like they were better. These headphones ended losing their Bluetooth capabilities. And after a few hard workouts the speaker lost power and was quiet.	negative
Tried to pair multiple times and never worked!!! Only pairs when 10 feet apart! THIS IS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR!	negative
As soon as we opened package and tried the first one, it broke. The other two seem to work ok, but I was pretty disappointed that we started with a broken one. Not sure how well these are going to last.....	negative
Too small not at it shows on the photo	negative
3 of the ornaments were broke or defective. 😩	negative
Stiff,short, hard to swat. Like slapping metal around	negative
Horrible. Have bought for family member no one has liked them at all. Would never reccomend.	negative
Bought this for my small dog to have water throughout the day in her crate. It leaked all the water into her crate and barely stayed fastened to the crate. Very cheap plastic.	negative
Couldn't find a way to set the wallpaper...... Disappointed!	negative
these creamers were sent in a very damaged state. the box was very damaged, and the creamers were all leaking. had to throw them all away, ( what a mess ) don,t replace, just refund .	negative
The convenience of this pool cover is great, as it clamps conveniently to each leg of the frame. However, upon opening my pool this year, I noticed tears in various spots on the cover. It only went through one season! You would think the manufacturer understands that this Intex, 18' above ground pool is made for outdoor use, and the cover needs to have the same resistance to weather. I live in southern California, but the pool cover is tearing before being hit by the summer heat. It's only May! Color me very disappointed!	negative
It would be nice to know what it was that I ordered!!	negative
Followed all directions and glass did not stick very well. The only sticky part is the top and bottom of protective glass. I dropped phone on two separate occasions and protective glass popped right off. Guess I'll just stick to otter box.	negative
Received this mixer in July. Didn’t use it until now. Big mistake!! It is broken - the mixer makes a loud noise while mixing, and the beaters don’t spin smoothly. My return window is over, and now I have a broken mixer.	negative
Too small, too bad, keep looking	negative
No return policy. Seems confusing to put together and there are no clear instructions or videos. I also would need to buy a luggage rack to make this work.	negative
Never received item. Seller did not answer emails.	negative
Though it would help with acne scars, but did not do a thing. plus made my skin oily. useless !	negative
Waste of money screen protector does not let me type like it should peels off instantly does give privacy but quality for the money its a no no	negative
Worked for 4 months and then quit. It worked great until it quit working. I charged the unit and it would show green. The on botton quit working. It must have a short in it. Product made in China. Waste of $48. Very disappointed.	negative
Key did not work, just kept spinning in cuffs	negative
It started leaking the day we got it!	negative
I have adhesive stains from two-sided tape holding rugs on flat carpet. Used first time today on two section following directions. The stains are still in place. Did not work for me, unfortunately. They were a year old not new stains if that would make a difference, For those two stains I used up a half can.	negative
Just a hard piece of plastic that slips over the phone. Provides no screen protection since it does not have the rubbery insert. I should have paid more attention to the description I guess.	negative
I purchased the frame in May 2017 for a teenage boy who weighs about 150 pounds. Welded pieces started falling off a few months ago. Last night the entire frame caved in due to the broken pieces. Disappointing and waste of money.	negative
Gave this as a Christmas gift. Package was damaged (probably previously ordered, opened, and returned) and was missing the base station.	negative
Terrible. False claims. May as well have ordered a time machine.	negative
the sound and quality* is great, just make sure you dont somehow damage the usb-c port like i did. the quality of the sound, the mic pickup, all of it is great and i love the design but the huge flaw is that the usb-c port is just weak and when damaged renders the headset useless	negative
dont waste your money, at the first time that the kids used it there was one broken...	negative
The zipper keeps getting stuck.	negative
I guess I did not receive a new one since it wasn’t even packaged properly and came with a child’s ripped drawing inside...	negative
It didn't even faze the dogs at all the just walked into it like it wasn't even there!!! Waste of my money	negative
Very short and slide off the hands. Any material you’re working with will enter through.	negative
It loses data and files become corrupt on a regular basis. Piece of junk.	negative
Doesn’t help with anything. I bought as per my colleagues recommendation for sore throat and and cold symptoms- did absolutely nothing l had so many cups of this ...!!!	negative
This product does not work as good as I thought! I placed these pads on the bottom of my soles and they within 24 hours fell off. I was in a meeting and one stuck to the ground and it was quite embarrassing.	negative
Very cute, but the great battery lasts 20 minutes. A regular alkaline battery lasted 5 hours on high.	negative
very small and uncomfortable	negative
I bought 2, do they look like unicorns?	negative
The mats are flimsy and already starting to crumple and fold. I’d like to return these.	negative
iF YOU ARE DIABETIC OR SENSITIVE TO SUGAR, LEAVE THIS ALONE. They have loaded this with so much sugar to hide the taste you will go into a coma with one gulp. LOL! But it is pretty bad.	negative
Snapped in place in less than 30 seconds	negative
The customer services is great and very helpful. The battery on the other hand is garbage, the pins get pushed into the battery whenever it gets inserted into the psp which then causes it to not work or charge them. Had this issue with the first one and they immediately sent a replacement and same issue happened with the second.	negative
Feel like I wasted money. I followed the directions and the protein doesn’t even show a color that is on the sheet. It stays an orange color. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what. But also, the colors tend to bleed together a little which also makes it inaccurate.	negative
As soon as I plugged these in, they got very hot. I returned them.	negative
So Flimsy... Can't even survive the shipping process. When a box arrives in perfect condition but the hook is bent to such a degree it's practically unusable, it is definitely a quality issue. Don't waste your time and money on this.	negative
This product was way to small for me. I ordered a 4x hoping for it to fit, but it was nothing like the picture. The sleeves were more like 3/4 sleeves and the length barely went past my waist. I was not happy with this product at all!	negative
My package was empty. Thought it felt light, opened it up to find nothing but the inside of the package bag. Serious disappointment for this medical student. I’ll change this review when I’m recieved what I paid for.	negative
FREE - ITS FREE BECAUSE YOU NEVER RECEIVE FREE	negative
I have not received any shoes. Please check into this matter and refund my money without delay Thank you	negative
NOT worth the money or complicated install. Would never fully turn off and would drip non stop. Bought in Sept and the inside pieces already broke. Contacted Enzo for warranty help, they're willing to send replacement parts but we opted to just replace the faucet...	negative
I ordered it “new,” and it definitely appears as though it sat in a book store window since 1989. The book itself came with water damage on the back cover and discoloration on the book jacket. Some of the pages were also folded on the corners.	negative
These are BLUETOOTH headphones that you plug into your phone for power. Which kinda defeats the purpose of Bluetooth all the while draining your battery even more. There is zero mention of this, so either these damn things are defective or inaccurately advertised. DO NOT BUY.	negative
The outdoor temperature quit working about 5 months ago. I have had less than a year. I cannot get assistance beyond them explaining to remove/replace batteries, and the sensor replacement is essentially as much as the item. My grandfather is so sad, he was truly enjoying it while it was functioning.	negative
It didn’t take long for the wheels to start snapping off. If you’re going to buy rollerblades, invest in a quality pair that will last you	negative
I had this TV for five months I set it up right and it just fell over and broke it never worked right in the first place don't buy it	negative
Got my own fast. No issue with seller. Nothing like a Magnum	negative
The lights flicker when you dim them, making this product useless. I used it on a floor lamp that has four 60-watt incandescent bulbs. I didn't keep the original packaging so I cannot return it. I just wasted $16.99, so beware, and do not do the same.	negative
Didn't even buy the camera. Cancelled the order before I got it. Still never got my refund.	negative
I would not buy this ever again. There was a static sound that came through the headphones all the time. It worked for about a month and now doesn’t work with any headphones. Definitely not worth it.	negative
I tried this product 3 times and each time my hair was like straw. Apparently it does not do what it is supposed to. I would like to return it.	negative
Not very good. Not worth the price. Awful quality! Awful quality. Don't buy. far from ok. I was very surprised at the poor quality of the product.	negative
This is the most horrible shirt. Does not fit what so ever. Its extremely short. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money!!	negative
Didn’t like this product. When I would wash my hands moisture easily got inside and then I couldn’t see anything on the watch. It was a pain taking it apart just to wipe the inside. I returned it for a refund.	negative
Did not last I bought these in June of 2019 and now September 2019 they don't work. I have a red pair that I have had since 2016 when they used to be just noise hush and still work. The earbuds have gone down in quality. Even the packaging was better in 2016. I decided to try again with another pair but even on the highest volume I could still hear the outside noise.	negative
My daughter was desperate for this toy. It is overpriced plastic junk that she played with for barely two weeks. Now it’s in the trash.	negative

"It's finally football season and I was so excited to use it to watch my favorite team play but when I set it up and went to sit down I heard a pop! The plastic support broke out of the chair! I'm a 6'0"" male and weigh 160lbs so it's disappointing that the chair didn't hold up to even one season."	negative
I wish I could give 0 stars. We used baby dry when my son was a newborn and they worked great. Bought these and the first one I put on 2 mom later my son is screaming his head off. I finally make the connection and take the diaper off and he has BURNS all over his bottom. DONT BUY	negative
Doesn’t work! It quacks but that’s it, doesn’t even attempt to blow bubbles. Will return! Very disappointed as this was part of my son’s Easter basket!	negative
Arrived damaged. Contact support with no response.	negative
The lights a lot cleaner than the old ones I had but some of the housing was cracked so I had to rig it myself to not deal with shipping it back	negative
Less than 2 months and the car adapter no longer works.	negative
Not easy to have two speakers connect	negative
The silk is beautiful! My baby loved it but my wooden ring broke after she had it for just a couple days.	negative
Definitely a one time use, material starts to stretch within a hour and just keeps stretching. material is pretty but would only buy for a small event or costume	negative
They fit well in the ear, but don't stay attached to the headphones very well.	negative
The pictures are cute and all, but the books are not very engaging, They don't teach the ABCs in the corresponding book.	negative
A little deceiving from Facebook add looked like a rubber mask not plastic. Suit seems fine .	negative
The headset I got my grandson some time it works an other tome it doesn't would like to return it	negative
OK BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. NOT IMPRESSED WITH. SEEMS SMALL. AGOOD BANDAID WOULD DO SAME. CAN ONLY BE HONEST ,	negative
Notice NO difference between these and regular reading glasses	negative
Would not work with my HDX. Seemed like pad would slide out of case.	negative
Didn't work that well for me.	negative
Misleading cover, I had thought it would be a great book for a child to use to learn piano with help on colored or numbered keys, but it is not geared for a child regarding this. It teaches how to read sheet music and proceed with the piano lesson with basic children' s songs. I had seen other books start a child out with getting the child to learn the keys by numbering them or coloring them with stickers. Making it more fun for the child to participate in a piano lesson.	negative
I only receive one even though the description stated I would receive a 3 pack.	negative
The baby alive brunette came in good condition but not function correctly. When you feed her with noodle occasionally nothing happens and the you need to use your finger to take out the noodles. It’s so bad to my niece. I don’t return because it’s a Christmas gift and she threw the Box. I don’t recommend it. Don’t waste your money.	negative
Didn't like at all but I am not going to pay to return so will just sit around till I throw it out.	negative
I dont think this is gonna be the go around we hoped for. Google asked for much more than a log in name to get into this app. I had to do the youtube.com/activate routine. Now they know what device I'm using. darn it.	negative
These are rated very high, and I love that they are made from whole foods. But they make me very nauseous (I am not pregnant, but taking prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy), and a serving size is 3 tablets at a time.	negative
I bought these because of the lower price compared with similar items but what a mistake I have made! The sheets are so thin and the cover fell off within the first few days of school. They are not the type of notebooks I usually buy and I usually buy them at a local store, but this time I was being lazy and did not want to make a trip to the store. But a lesson is learned. I will stick with my usual brand.	negative
Material was not what expected	negative
Don't think it really does anything	negative
Little girls underwhelmed by the neutral colors; over time polish got thin and didn’t cover well	negative
It wasn’t exactly like the picture and a a stone came off same day I received it but it was a beautiful case so I have already ordered 3 total all at once won’t purchase again though because of that low quality product	negative
Hard to use don't open easily and then hard to put over goat leg	negative
Needs a really smooth surface. Not easy to fine in most houses	negative
TOOOO MUCH INFORMATION! AND...most of it is like previous materials I've bought from you. :( So didn't give away as intended.....and now the return date has past! Sigh......!!	negative
I am not sure if I received a legitimate product. The diameter of the tube is not the same as the diameter of the scope. It looks cheap when installed on the scope. As far as function, I am sure it would serve the purpose just fine. However on a $1000 scope I want something that both looks and performs well. I contacted Amazon and their service was great with helping me get a refund.	negative
Not for a truck driver	negative
It will work but it is so thin that I am afraid of breaking it with normal use.	negative
This may not be a reflection of the actual product but these owls definitely didn't stop other birds or critters from nibbling at my plants :(	negative

Trigger warning. I’m sick and tired of TV shows using rape as plot. It’s disgusting.	negative
These unfortunately fell apart after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer. They’re very soft, and mostly wrinkle resistant, but not durable at all!	negative
I suspect it is my fault but they all died.	negative
I did not like them they are too heavy they are too noisy	negative
I bought this and used it and had only 2 flushes. I don't know what happened. It lost it's potency.	negative
Why change in cap design? Arrived damaged and spilled soap contents seeped from the sealed box and spread to other items in the box. The seal on the original bottle design worked great! This item is not eligible for return with subscribe and save. I am going to cancel my next order and purchase another brand that ships better.	negative
Much smaller than expected and product box was damaged and looked like someone used Scotch tape to try to reseal it. Was embarrassed to give this as a gift due to condition received.	negative
Craftsmanship is far worse than the listing picture alludes. It looks like a first attempt at welding by a 7 year old in a poorly lit garage. Sloppily painted with silver to cover what must be rust. I will most likely return the two I bought.	negative
I’ve replaced all shoe laces on my toddler’s shoes with these. So far we’ve lost 4 end clips, no matter what we do they keep coming off and getting lost. Worth buying only for the elastic laces; I’ll stick to Lock Laces from now on.	negative
This product takes forever to get the wrinkles out of your clothes and you have to keep filling it up with water. It's really annoying to have to keep running to the sink to refill it. It is a more ideal for removing wrinkles for maybe like one clothing item. I like to remove the wrinkles out of my clothes after doing laundry and I usually have a couple clothing items and I cannot efficiently get it done with this product.	negative
Unfortunately this didn’t work my scalp acne.	negative
Came all crumble up didn’t like the way they packaged it	negative
I've noticed no energy boost in this latest bottle. I've learned from visiting the GNC site that people are complaining about a formula change and are experiencing the same sluggish feelings I'm having. The bottle I received have green pills. I remember the yellow ones were much better.	negative
