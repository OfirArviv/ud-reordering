Please note the following as you review :	R1 discourse L2 root L1 obj L1 amod R2 mark R1 nsubj L5 advcl L6 punct
1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of midmarket forms our anticipate that we will act as billing agent customer 's and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on invoice our ) and on pass those amounts to utility the customer 's .

3 .

That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in opinion my , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in thinking his - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything the Government actually does that , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .
