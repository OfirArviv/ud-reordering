Please note the following as you review :	R1 discourse L2 root L1 obj L1 amod R2 mark R1 nsubj L5 advcl L6 punct
1 . The forms short do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of forms our midmarket anticipate that we will act as billing agent customer 's and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on invoice our ) and pass those amounts on to utility the customer 's .

2 .

3 . The change in law provision reads differently a bit from the form long -- the thinking here is that the form long language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we 've had difficulty great selling it in the past ) .	R7 nummod L1 punct R1 det R4 nsubj R2 case R1 compound L3 nmod L8 root L1 advmod R1 det L2 obl R2 case R1 det L5 obl L1 amod L8 punct R1 det R2 nsubj L1 advmod L12 conj R7 mark R3 det R2 compound L1 amod R3 nsubj R2 cop R1 advmod L8 ccomp R2 cc R1 advmod L3 conj R4 punct R3 cc R2 nsubj R1 aux L28 conj L1 obj L1 amod L3 advcl L1 obj R2 case R1 det L7 obl L8 punct L37 punct
, we decided Taking into consideration this class of customer to include items certain , including inability our to cover costs our due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .

Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the form long does -- again , more in the than anything else interest of " saving space " ...

That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in opinion my , because he has one flaw tragic - a spot very serious blind in thinking his - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Court Supreme Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Theory Executive Unitary , " which calls for Power vastly - increased Presidential at the expense of Congress and the Court Supreme .

But Samuel Alito believes in a theory little - known Constitutional - called the " Theory Executive Unitary " - which says that the President should have control complete over the Branch Executive , and that the Branch Executive should be in charge of almost everything the Government actually does that , including the functions of the Agencies Independent which were designed to be free of control Presidential , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by authority specific given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .
