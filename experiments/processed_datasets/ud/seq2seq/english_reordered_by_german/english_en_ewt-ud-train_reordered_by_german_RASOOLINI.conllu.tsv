instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a " modest " increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim .

Please note following the as you review :	R1 discourse L2 root R1 amod L2 obj R2 mark R1 nsubj L5 advcl L6 punct
1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of midmarket forms our anticipate that we will act as billing agent customer 's and that we will collect all due related to T&D and the like amounts from the customer ( and reflect same on invoice our ) and on pass those amounts to utility the customer 's .

2 .

3 . The change in law provision a bit differently from the long form reads -- the here thinking is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .

Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including inability our to cover costs our due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .

That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in opinion my , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in thinking his - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .

Although the origins of a movement that was largely confined to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society largely remained Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .
