It is understanding my , from good sources in office the Gov s that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend auhtority all parties to enter into direct access contracts .

The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously quickly suspend right everyone 's to bilateral contracts , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must through break .

I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
