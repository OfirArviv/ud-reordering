1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer's customer 's utility .

3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we've we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .

Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .

That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .

1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .

Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .

The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .
