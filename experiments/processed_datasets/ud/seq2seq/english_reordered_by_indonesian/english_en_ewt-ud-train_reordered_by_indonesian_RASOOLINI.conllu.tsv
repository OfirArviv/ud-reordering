1 . The forms short do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of forms our midmarket anticipate that we will act as billing agent customer 's and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on invoice our ) and on pass those amounts to utility the customer 's .

That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in opinion my , because he has one flaw tragic - a spot very serious blind in thinking his - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Court Supreme Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Theory Executive Unitary , " which calls for Power vastly - increased Presidential at the expense of Congress and the Court Supreme .
